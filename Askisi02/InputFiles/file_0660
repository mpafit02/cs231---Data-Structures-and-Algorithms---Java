 against whom have you said evil and bitter things and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the holy one of israel
 you have sent your servants with evil words against the lord and have said with all my war carriages i have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of lebanon and its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods i will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
 i have made water holes and taken their waters and with my foot i have made all the rivers of egypt dry
 has it not come to your ears how i did it long before purposing it in times long past now i have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
 this is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field or a green plant like the grass on the house tops which a cold wind makes waste
 but i have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
 because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and i will make you go back by the way you came
 and this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine gardens and take of their fruit
 and those of judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
 for from jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of mount zion by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done
 for this cause the lord says about the king of assyria he will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
 by the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town
 for i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 and the angel of the lord went out and put to death in the army of the assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
 sennacherib king of assyria went back to his place at nineveh
 and it came about when he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that his sons adrammelech and sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of ararat and esar haddon his son became king in his place
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said to him the lord says put your house in order for your death is near
 and hezekiah turning his face to the wall made his prayer to the lord saying
 o lord keep in mind how i have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
 then the word of the lord came to isaiah saying
 go to hezekiah and say the lord the god of david your father says your prayer has come to my ears and i have seen your weeping see i will give you fifteen more years of life
 and i will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of assyria and i will keep watch over this town
 and isaiah said this is the sign the lord will give you that he will do what he has said
 see i will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of ahaz with the sun go back ten steps so the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down
 the writing of hezekiah king of judah after he had been ill and had got better from his disease
 i said in the quiet of my days i am going down into the underworld the rest of my years are being taken away from me
 i said i will not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i will not see man again or those living in the world
 my resting place is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsmans tent my life is rolled up like a linen workers thread i am cut off from the cloth on the frame from day even to night you give me up to pain
 i am crying out with pain till the morning it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones
 i make cries like a bird i give out sounds of grief like a dove my eyes are looking up with desire o lord i am crushed take up my cause
