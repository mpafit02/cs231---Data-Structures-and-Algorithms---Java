 and we went away from philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread and came to them at troas in five days and we were there for seven days
 and on the first day of the week when we had come together for the holy meal paul gave them a talk for it was his purpose to go away on the day after and he went on talking till after the middle of the night
 and there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together
 and a certain young man named eutychus who was seated in the window went into a deep sleep and while paul went on talking being overcome by sleep he had a fall from the third floor and was taken up dead
 and paul went down and falling on him took him in his arms and said do not be troubled for his life is in him
 and when he had gone up and had taken the broken bread he went on talking to them for a long time even till dawn and then he went away
 and they took the boy in living and were greatly comforted
 but we going before him by ship went to assos with the purpose of taking paul in there for so he had given orders because he himself was coming by land
 and when he came up with us at assos we took him in the ship and went on to mitylene
 and going from there by sea we came on the day after opposite chios and touching at samos on the day after that we came on the third day to miletus
 for pauls purpose was to go past ephesus so that he might not be kept in asia for he was going quickly in order if possible to be at jerusalem on the day of pentecost
 and from miletus he sent to ephesus for the rulers of the church
 and when they had come he said to them you yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when i first came into asia
 doing the lords work without pride through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the jews
 and how i kept back nothing which might be of profit to you teaching you publicly and privately
 preaching to jews and to greeks the need for a turning of the heart to god and faith in the lord jesus christ
 and now as you see i am going to jerusalem a prisoner in spirit having no knowledge of what will come to me there
 only that the holy spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me
 but i put no value on my life if only at the end of it i may see the work complete which was given to me by the lord jesus to be a witness of the good news of the grace of god
 and now i am conscious that you among whom i have gone about preaching the kingdom will not see my face again
 and so i say to you this day that i am clean from the blood of all men
 for i have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of god
 give attention to yourselves and to all the flock which the holy spirit has given into your care to give food to the church of god for which he gave his blood
 i am conscious that after i am gone evil wolves will come in among you doing damage to the flock
 and from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching turning away the disciples after them
 so keep watch having in mind that for three years without resting i was teaching every one of you day and night with weeping
 and now i give you into the care of god and the word of his grace which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints
 i have had no desire for any mans silver or gold or clothing
 you yourselves have seen that with these hands i got what was necessary for me and those who were with me
 in all things i was an example to you of how in your lives you are to give help to the feeble and keep in memory the words of the lord jesus how he himself said there is a greater blessing in giving than in getting
