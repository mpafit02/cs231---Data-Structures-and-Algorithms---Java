 and some of those who were with us went to the place and saw that it was as the women had said but him they did not see
 and he said o foolish men  how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said
 was it not necessary for the christ to go through these things and to come into his glory
 and he made clear to them all the things in the writings from moses and from all the prophets which had to do with himself
 and they came near the town to which they were going and he seemed as if he was going on
 but they kept him back saying do not go for evening is near the day is almost gone and he went in with them
 and when he was seated with them at table he took the bread and said words of blessing and making division of it he gave it to them
 and then their eyes were open and they had knowledge of him but he went from their view
 and they said to one another were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way making clear to us the holy writings
 and that very hour they got up and went back to jerusalem where the eleven and the others had come together
 and they said to them the lord has truly come back to life again and simon has seen him
 and they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way and how when he gave them bread they had knowledge of him
 and while they were saying these things he himself was among them and said to them peace be with you 
 but they were full of fear being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit
 and he said to them why are you troubled and why are your hearts full of doubt
 see my hands and my feet it is i myself put your hands on me and make certain for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that i have
 and when he had said this he let them see his hands and his feet
 and because for joy and wonder they were still in doubt he said to them have you any food here
 and they gave him a bit of cooked fish
 and before their eyes he took a meal
 and he said to them these are the words which i said to you when i was still with you how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of moses and the prophets and in the psalms about me to be put into effect
 then he made the holy writings clear to their minds
 and he said to them so it is in the writings that the christ would undergo death and come back to life again on the third day
 and that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to jerusalem first and to all nations in his name
 you are witnesses of these things
 and now i will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you but do not go from the town till the power from heaven comes to you
 and he took them out till they were near bethany and lifting up his hands he gave them a blessing
 and while he was doing so he went from them and was taken up into heaven
 and they gave him worship and went back to jerusalem with great joy
 and they were in the temple at all times giving praise to god
