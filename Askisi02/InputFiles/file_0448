 a man of another nation may be forced to make payment of his debt but if your brother has anything of yours let it go
 but there will be no poor among you for the lord will certainly give you his blessing in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 if only you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and take care to keep all these orders which i give you today
 for the lord your god will give you his blessing as he has said you will let other nations have the use of your money but you will not make use of theirs you will be rulers over a number of nations but they will not be your rulers
 if in any of your towns in the land which the lord your god is giving you there is a poor man one of your countrymen do not let your heart be hard or your hand shut to him
 but let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of
 and see that there is no evil thought in your heart moving you to say to yourself the seventh year the year of forgiveness is near and so looking coldly on your poor countryman you give him nothing and he will make an outcry to the lord against you and it will be judged as sin in you
 but it is right for you to give to him without grief of heart for because of this the blessing of the lord your god will be on all your work and on everything to which you put your hand
 for there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land and so i give orders to you let your hand be open to your countrymen to those who are poor and in need in your land
 if one of your countrymen a hebrew man or woman becomes your servant for a price and does work for you six years in the seventh year let him go free
 and when you make him free do not let him go away with nothing in his hands
 but give him freely from your flock and from your grain and your wine in the measure of the wealth which the lord your god has given you you are to give to him
 and keep in mind that you yourself were a servant in the land of egypt and the lord your god made you free so i give you this order today
 but if he says to you i have no desire to go away from you because you and your family are dear to him and he is happy with you
 then take a sharp pointed instrument driving it through his ear into the door and he will be your servant for ever and you may do the same for your servant girl
 let it not seem hard to you that you have to send him away free for he has been working for you for six years which is twice the regular time for a servant and the blessing of the lord your god will be on you in everything you do
 all the first males to come to birth in your herd and your flock are to be holy to the lord your god the first birth of your ox is not to be used for work the wool of your first lamb is not to be cut
 but year by year you and all your house are to take a meal of it before the lord in the place of his selection
 but if it has any mark on it if it is blind or has damaged legs or if there is anything wrong with it it may not be offered to the lord your god
 it may be used for food in your houses the unclean and the clean may take of it as of the gazelle and the roe
 only do not take its blood for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
 take note of the month of abib and keep the passover to the lord your god for in the month of abib the lord your god took you out of egypt by night
 the passover offering from your flock or your herd is to be given to the lord your god in the place marked out by him as the resting place of his name
 take no leavened bread with it for seven days let your food be unleavened bread that is the bread of sorrow for you came out of the land of egypt quickly so the memory of that day when you came out of the land of egypt will be with you all your life
 for seven days let no leaven be used through all your land and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning
 the passover offering is not to be put to death in any of the towns which the lord your god gives you
 but in the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place of his name there you are to put the passover to death in the evening at sundown at that time of the year when you came out of egypt
 it is to be cooked and taken as food in the place marked out by the lord and in the morning you are to go back to your tents
 for six days let your food be unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a holy meeting to the lord your god no work is to be done
 let seven weeks be numbered from the first day when the grain is cut
