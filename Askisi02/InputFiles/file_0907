 and the lord said to moses in the waste land of sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of egypt
 let the children of israel keep the passover at its regular time
 in the fourteenth day of this month at evening you are to keep it at the regular time and in the way ordered in the law
 and moses gave orders to the children of israel to keep the passover
 so they kept the passover in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the waste land of sinai as the lord gave orders to moses so the children of israel did
 and there were certain men who were unclean because of a dead body so that they were not able to keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day
 and these men said to him we have been made unclean by the dead body of a man why may we not make the offering of the lord at the regular time among the children of israel
 and moses said to them do nothing till the lord gives me directions about you
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body or is on a journey far away still he is to keep the passover to the lord
 in the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they are to keep it taking it with unleavened bread and bitter tasting plants
 nothing of it is to be kept till the morning and no bone of it is to be broken they are to keep it by the rules of the passover
 but the man who not being unclean or on a journey does not keep the passover will be cut off from his people because he did not make the offering of the lord at the regular time his sin will be on him
 and if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the passover to the lord let him do as is ordered in the law of the passover there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land
 and on the day when the house was put up the cloud came down on it on the tent of witness and in the evening there was a light like fire over the house till the morning
 and so it was at all times it was covered by the cloud and by a light as of fire by night
 and whenever the cloud was taken up from over the house then the children of israel went journeying on and in the place where the cloud came to rest there the children of israel put up their tents
 at the order of the lord the children of israel went forward and at the order of the lord they put up their tents as long as the cloud was resting on the house they did not go away from that place
 when the cloud was resting on the house for a long time the children of israel waiting for the order of the lord did not go on
 sometimes the cloud was resting on the house for two or three days then by the order of the lord they kept their tents in that place and when the lord gave the order they went on
 and sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again or if it was resting there by day and by night whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward
 or if the cloud came to rest on the house for two days or a month or a year without moving the children of israel went on waiting there and did not go on but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey
 at the word of the lord they put up their tents and at the word of the lord they went forward on their journey they kept the orders of the lord as he gave them by moses
 the vision of obadiah this is what the lord has said about edom we have had word from the lord and a representative has been sent among the nations saying up  and let us make war against her

 though you go up on high like an eagle though your house is placed among the stars i will make you come down from there says the lord
