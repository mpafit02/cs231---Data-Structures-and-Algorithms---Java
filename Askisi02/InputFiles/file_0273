 make clear his glory to the nations and his wonders to all the peoples
 for the lord is great and greatly to be praised and he is more to be feared than all other gods
 for all the gods of the nations are false gods but the lord made the heavens
 honour and glory are before him strength and joy are in his holy place
 give to the lord o you families of the peoples give to the lord glory and strength
 give to the lord the glory of his name take with you an offering and come before him give worship to the lord in holy robes
 be in fear before him all the earth the world is ordered so that it may not be moved
 let the heavens have joy and let the earth be glad let them say among the nations the lord is king
 let the sea be thundering with all its waters let the field be glad and everything which is in it
 then let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy before the lord for he is come to be the judge of the earth
 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and say be our saviour o god of our salvation and let us come back and give us salvation from the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
 praise be to the lord the god of israel for ever and for ever and all the people said so be it and gave praise to the lord
 so he made asaph and his brothers keep their places there before the ark of the agreement of the lord to do whatever had to be done before the ark at all times day by day
 and obed edom the son of jeduthun and hosah with their brothers sixty eight of them to be door keepers
 and zadok the priest with his brothers the priests before the house of the lord in the high place at gibeon
 to give burned offerings to the lord on the altar of burned offerings morning and evening every day as it is ordered in the law of the lord which he gave to israel
 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest who were marked out by name to give praise to the lord for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and heman and jeduthun had horns and brass instruments sounding loudly and instruments of music for the songs of god and the sons of jeduthun were to be at the door
 and all the people went away every man to his house and david went back to give a blessing to his family
 now when david was living in his house he said to nathan the prophet see i am living in a house of cedar wood but the ark of the lords agreement is under the curtains of a tent
 and nathan said to david do whatever is in your heart for god is with you
 but that same night the word of god came to nathan saying
 go and say to david my servant the lord says you are not to make me a house for my living place
 for from the day when i took israel up till this day i have had no house but have gone from tent to tent and from living place to living place
 in all the places where i have gone with all israel did i ever say to any of the judges of israel whom i made the keepers of my people why have you not made for me a house of cedar
 so now say to my servant david the lord of armies says i took you from the fields from keeping sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people israel
 and i have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and i will make your name like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
 and i will make a resting place for my people israel planting them there so that they may be in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be made waste by evil men as they were at first
 from the time when i put judges over my people israel and i will overcome all those who are against you and i will make you great and the head of a line of kings
