 and the kings servants came to our lord king david blessing him and saying may god make the name of solomon better than your name and the seat of his authority greater than your seat and the king was bent low in worship on his bed
 then the king said may the god of israel be praised who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it
 and all the guests of adonijah got up in fear and went away every man to his place
 and adonijah himself was full of fear because of solomon and he got up and went to the altar and put his hands on its horns
 and they gave solomon word of it saying see adonijah goes in such fear of king solomon that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword
 and solomon said if he is seen to be a man of good faith not a hair of him will be touched but if any wrongdoing is seen in him he is to be put to death
 so king solomon sent and they took him down from the altar and he came and gave honour to king solomon and solomon said to him go to your house
 now the queen of sheba hearing great things of solomon came to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions
 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels weighted down with spices and stores of gold and jewels and when she came to solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind
 and solomon gave her answers to all her questions there was no secret which the king did not make clear to her
 and when the queen of sheba had seen all the wisdom of solomon and the house which he had made
 and the food at his table and all his servants seated there and those who were waiting on him in their places and their robes and his wine servants and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
 and she said to the king the account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true
 but i had no faith in what was said about you till i came and saw for myself and now i see that it was not half the story your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said
 happy are your wives happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you hearing your words of wisdom
 may the lord your god be praised whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of israel because the lords love for israel is eternal he has made you king to be their judge in righteousness
 and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a great store of spices and jewels never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of sheba gave king solomon
 and the sea force of hiram in addition to gold from ophir came back with much sandal wood and jewels
 and from the sandal wood the king made pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house and instruments of music for the makers of melody never has such sandal wood been seen to this day
 and king solomon gave the queen of sheba all her desire whatever she made request for in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart so she went back to her country she and her servants
 now the weight of gold which came to solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents
 in addition to what came to him from the business of the traders and from all the kings of the arabians and from the rulers of the country
 and solomon made two hundred body covers of hammered gold every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it
 and he made three hundred smaller body covers of hammered gold with three pounds of gold in every cover and the king put them in the house of the woods of lebanon
 then the king made a great ivory seat plated with the best gold
 there were six steps going up to it and the top of it was round at the back there were arms on the two sides of the seat and two lions by the side of the arms
 and twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps there was nothing like it in any kingdom
 and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the woods of lebanon were of the best gold not one was of silver for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of king solomon
 for the king had tarshish ships at sea with the ships of hiram once every three years the tarshish ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks
 and king solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom
