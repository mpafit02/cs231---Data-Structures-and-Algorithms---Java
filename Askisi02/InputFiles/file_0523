 they give us no dry stems and they say to us make bricks and they give your servants blows but it is your people who are in the wrong
 but he said you have no love for work that is why you say let us go and make an offering to the lord
 go now get back to your work no dry stems will be given to you but you are to make the full number of bricks
 then the responsible men of the children of israel saw that they were purposing evil when they said the number of bricks which you have to make every day will be no less than before
 and they came face to face with moses and aaron who were in their way when they came out from pharaoh
 and they said to them may the lord take note of you and be your judge for you have given pharaoh and his servants a bad opinion of us putting a sword in their hands for our destruction
 and moses went back to the lord and said lord why have you done evil to this people why have you sent me
 for from the time when i came to pharaoh to put your words before him he has done evil to this people and you have given them no help
 and the lord said to moses now you will see what i am about to do to pharaoh for by a strong hand he will be forced to let them go driving them out of his land because of my outstretched arm
 and god said to moses i am yahweh
 i let myself be seen by abraham isaac and jacob as god the ruler of all but they had no knowledge of my name yahweh
 and i made an agreement with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their wanderings
 and truly my ears are open to the cry of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep under their yoke and i have kept in mind my agreement
 say then to the children of israel i am yahweh and i will take you out from under the yoke of the egyptians and make you safe from their power and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments
 and i will take you to be my people and i will be your god and you will be certain that i am the lord your god who takes you out from under the yoke of the egyptians
 and i will be your guide into the land which i made an oath to give to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it to you for your heritage i am yahweh
 and moses said these words to the children of israel but they gave no attention to him because of the grief of their spirit and the cruel weight of their work
 and the lord said to moses
 go in and say to pharaoh king of egypt that he is to let the children of israel go out of his land
 and moses answering the lord said see the children of israel will not give ear to me how then will pharaoh give ear to me whose lips are unclean
 and the word of the lord came to moses and aaron with orders for the children of israel and for pharaoh king of egypt to take the children of israel out of the land of egypt
