 and all the meeting of the children of israel as well as those from other lands living among them will have forgiveness for it was an error on the part of the people
 and if one person does wrong without being conscious of it then let him give a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
 and the priest will take away the sin of the person who has done wrong if the wrong was done unconsciously and he will have forgiveness
 the law in connection with wrong done unconsciously is to be the same for him who is an israelite by birth and for the man from another country who is living among them
 but the person who does wrong in the pride of his heart if he is one of you or of another nation by birth is acting without respect for the lord and will be cut off from his people
 because he had no respect for the word of the lord and did not keep his law that man will be cut off without mercy and his sin will be on him
 now while the children of israel were in the waste land they saw a man who was getting sticks on the sabbath day
 and those who saw him getting sticks took him before moses and aaron and all the people
 and they had him shut up because they had no directions about what was to be done with him
 then the lord said to moses certainly the man is to be put to death let him be stoned by all the people outside the tent circle
 so all the people took him outside the tent circle and he was stoned to death there as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that through all their generations they are to put on the edges of their robes an ornament of twisted threads and in every ornament a blue cord
 so that looking on these ornaments you may keep in mind the orders of the lord and do them and not be guided by the desires of your hearts and eyes through which you have been untrue to me
 and that you may keep in mind all my orders and do them and be holy to your god
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt so that i might be your god i am the lord your god
 now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi with dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of pallu the son of reuben made themselves ready
 and came before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty chiefs of the people men of good name who had a place in the meeting of the people
 they came together against moses and against aaron and said to them you take overmuch on yourselves seeing that all the people are holy every one of them and the lord is among them why then have you put yourselves in authority over the people of the lord
 and moses hearing this went down on his face
 and he said to korah and his band in the morning the lord will make clear who are his and who is holy and who may come near him the man of his selection will be caused to come near him
 so do this let korah and all his band take vessels for burning perfumes
 and put spices on the fire in them before the lord tomorrow then the man marked out by the lord will be holy you take overmuch on yourselves you sons of levi
 and moses said to korah give ear now you sons of levi
 does it seem only a small thing to you that the god of israel has made you separate from the rest of israel letting you come near himself to do the work of the house of the lord and to take your place before the people to do what has to be done for them
 letting you and all your brothers the sons of levi come near to him and would you now be priests
 so you and all your band have come together against the lord and aaron who is he that you are crying out against him
 then moses sent for dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said we will not come up
 is it not enough that you have taken us from a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the waste land but now you are desiring to make yourself a chief over us
 and more than this you have not taken us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us a heritage of fields and vine gardens will you put out the eyes of these men we will not come up
