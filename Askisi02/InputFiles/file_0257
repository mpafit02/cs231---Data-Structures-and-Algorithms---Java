 but now we are free from the law having been made dead to that which had power over us so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit not in the old way of the letter
 what then is to be said is the law sin in no way but i would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law for i would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said you may not have a desire for what is anothers
 but sin taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law was working in me every form of desire because without the law sin is dead
 and there was a time when i was living without the law but when the law gave its orders sin came to life and put me to death
 and i made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death
 for i was tricked and put to death by sin which took its chance through the law
 but the law is holy and its orders are holy upright and good
 was then that which is good death to me in no way but the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil
 for we are conscious that the law is of the spirit but i am of the flesh given into the power of sin
 and i have no clear knowledge of what i am doing for that which i have a mind to do i do not but what i have hate for that i do
 but if i do that which i have no mind to do i am in agreement with the law that the law is good
 so it is no longer i who do it but the sin living in me
 for i am conscious that in me that is in my flesh there is nothing good i have the mind but not the power to do what is right
 for the good which i have a mind to do i do not but the evil which i have no mind to do that i do
 but if i do what i have no mind to do it is no longer i who do it but the sin living in me
 so i see a law that though i have a mind to do good evil is present in me
 in my heart i take pleasure in the law of god
 but i see another law in my body working against the law of my mind and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh
 how unhappy am i  who will make me free from the body of this death
 i give praise to god through jesus christ our lord so with my mind i am a servant to the law of god but with my flesh to the law of sin
 for this cause those who are in christ jesus will not be judged as sinners
 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death
 for what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh god sending his son in the image of the evil flesh and as an offering for sin gave his decision against sin in the flesh
 so that what was ordered by the law might be done in us who are living not in the way of the flesh but in the way of the spirit
 for those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh but those who go in the way of the spirit to the things of the spirit
 for the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the spirit is life and peace
 because the mind of the flesh is opposite to god it is not under the law of god and is not able to be
 so that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to god
 you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if the spirit of god is in you but if any man has not the spirit of christ he is not one of his
 and if christ is in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness
