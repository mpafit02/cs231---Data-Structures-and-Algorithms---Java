 happy is the man of your selection to whom you give a resting place in your house we will be full of the good things out of your holy place
 you will give us an answer in righteousness by great acts of power o god of our salvation you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the far off lands of the sea
 the god by whose strength the mountains are fixed who is robed with power
 who makes the loud voice of the sea quiet and puts an end to the sound of its waves
 those in the farthest parts of the earth have fear when they see your signs the outgoings of the morning and evening are glad because of you
 you have given your blessing to the earth watering it and making it fertile the river of god is full of water and having made it ready you give men grain
 you make the ploughed lands full of water you make smooth the slopes you make the earth soft with showers sending your blessing on its growth
 the year is crowned with the good you give life giving rain is dropping from your footsteps
 falling on the grass of the waste land and the little hills are glad on every side
 the grass land is thick with flocks the valleys are full of grain they give glad cries and songs of joy
 &ltto the chief music maker a song a psalm&gt send up a glad cry to god all the earth
 make a song in honour of his name give praise and glory to him
 say to god how greatly to be feared are your works  because of your great power your haters are forced to put themselves under your feet
 let all the earth give you worship and make songs to you let them make songs to your name  selah 
 come and see the works of god he is to be feared in all he does to the children of men
 the sea was turned into dry land they went through the river on foot there did we have joy in him
 he is ruling in power for ever his eyes are watching the nations may his haters have no strength against him  selah 
 give blessings to our god o you peoples let the voice of his praise be loud
 because he gives us life and has not let our feet be moved
 for you o god have put us to the test testing us by fire like silver
 you let us be put in prison chains were put on our legs
 you let men go driving over our heads we went through fire and through water but you took us out into a wide place
 i will come into your house with burned offerings i will make payment of my debt to you
 keeping the word which came from my lips and which my mouth said when i was in trouble
 i will give you burned offerings of fat beasts and the smoke of sheep i will make offerings of oxen and goats  selah 
 come give ear to me all you god fearing men so that i may make clear to you what he has done for my soul
 my voice went up to him and i was lifted up from the underworld
 i said in my heart the lord will not give ear to me
 but truly gods ear has been open he has give attention to the voice of my prayer
 praise be to god who has not taken away his good faith and his mercy from me
