 this is what the lord my god has said take care of the flock of death
 whose owners put them to death and have no sense of sin and those who get a price for them say may the lord be praised for i have much wealth and the keepers of the flock have no pity for them
 for i will have no more pity for the people of the land says the lord but i will give up everyone into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they will make the land waste and i will not keep them safe from their hands
 so i took care of the flock of death for those who made profit out of the flock and i took for myself two rods naming one beautiful and the other bands and i took care of the flock
 and in one month i put an end to the three keepers of the flock for my soul was tired of them and their souls were disgusted with me
 and i said i will not take care of you if death comes to any let death be its fate if any is cut off let it be cut off and let the rest take one anothers flesh for food
 and i took my rod beautiful cutting it in two so that the lords agreement which he had made with all the peoples might be broken
 and it was broken on that day and the sheep traders who were watching me were certain that it was the word of the lord
 and i said to them if it seems good to you give me my payment and if not do not give it so they gave me my payment by weight thirty shekels of silver
 and the lord said to me put it into the store house the price at which i was valued by them and i took the thirty shekels of silver and put them into the store house in the house of the lord
 then i took my other rod the one named bands cutting it in two so that the relation of brothers between judah and israel might be broken
 and the lord said to me take again the instruments of a foolish keeper of sheep
 for see i will put a sheep keeper over the land who will have no care for that which is cut off and will not go in search of the wanderers or make well what is broken and he will not give food to that which is ill but he will take for his food the flesh of the fat and let their feet be broken
 a curse on the foolish keeper who goes away from the flock  the sword will be on his arm and on his right eye his arm will become quite dry and his eye will be made completely dark
 the word of the lord about israel the lord by whom the heavens are stretched out and the bases of the earth put in place and the spirit of man formed inside him has said
 see i will make jerusalem a cup of shaking fear to all the peoples round about when jerusalem is shut in
 and it will come about in that day that i will make jerusalem a stone of great weight for all the peoples all those who take it up will be badly wounded and all the nations of the earth will come together against it
 in that day says the lord i will put fear into every horse and make every horseman go off his head and my eyes will be open on the people of judah and i will make every horse of the peoples blind
 and the families of judah will say in their hearts the people of jerusalem have their strength in the lord of armies their god
 in that day i will make the families of judah like a pot with fire in it among trees and like a flaming stick among cut grain they will send destruction on all the peoples round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem will be living again in the place which is hers that is in jerusalem
 and the lord will give salvation to the tents of judah first so that the glory of the family of david and the glory of the people of jerusalem may not be greater than that of judah
 in that day the lord will be a cover over the people of jerusalem and he who is feeble among them in that day will be as strong as david and the family of david will be as god as the angel of the lord before them
 and it will come about on that day that i will take in hand the destruction of all the nations who come against jerusalem
 and i will send down on the family of david and on the people of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of prayer and their eyes will be turned to the one who was wounded by their hands and they will be weeping for him as for an only son and their grief for him will be bitter like the grief of one sorrowing for his oldest son
 in that day there will be a great weeping in jerusalem like the weeping of hadad rimmon in the valley of megiddon
 and the land will give itself to weeping every family separately the family of david by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of nathan by themselves and their wives by themselves
 the family of levi by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of shimei by themselves and their wives by themselves
 and all the other families by themselves and their wives by themselves
 in that day there will be a fountain open to the family of david and to the people of jerusalem for sin and for that which is unclean
 and it will come about on that day says the lord of armies that i will have the names of the images cut off out of the land and there will be no more memory of them and i will send all the prophets and the unclean spirit away from the land
