 so changing his behaviour before them he made it seem as if he was off his head hammering on the doors of the town and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin
 then achish said to his servants look  the man is clearly off his head why have you let him come before me
 are there not enough unbalanced men about me that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me is such a man to come into my house
 so david went away from there and took cover in a strong place at adullam and his brothers and all his fathers people hearing of it went down to him there
 and everyone who was in trouble and everyone who was in debt and everyone who was bitter in soul came together to him and he became captain over them about four hundred men were joined to him
 and from there david went to mizpeh in the land of moab and he said to the king of moab let my father and mother come and make their living place with you till it is clear to me what god will do for me
 and he took them to the king of moab and they went on living with him while david was in his safe place
 and the prophet gad said to david do not go on living in this place but go into the land of judah then david went away and came to the woodland of hereth
 and news was given to saul that david had been seen and the men who were with him now saul was in gibeah seated under the tree in the high place with his spear in his hand and all his servants were in their places before him
 then saul said to his servants who were there about him give ear now you benjamites will the son of jesse give to every one of you fields and vine gardens will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands
 that all of you have made designs against me and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of jesse and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me as at this day
 then doeg the edomite who was by the side of the servants of saul in answer said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub
 and he got directions from the lord for him and gave him food and put in his hand the sword of goliath the philistine
 then the king sent for ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and for all the men of his fathers family who were priests in nob and they all came to the king
 and saul said give ear now o son of ahitub and answering he said here i am my lord
 and saul said to him why have you made designs against me with the son of jesse giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the lord for him and helping him to take up arms against me and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me as he is doing now
 then ahimelech answering said to the king who among all your servants is so true to you as david who is the kings son in law and is a captain of your armed men and has a place of honour in your house
 is this the first time i have got directions from god for him far be the thought  let the king make no such statement against his servant or my fathers family for your servant has no knowledge great or small of this thing
 and the king said you will certainly be put to death ahimelech you and all your fathers family
 then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him put the priests of the lord to death because they are on davids side and having knowledge of his flight did not give me word of it but the kings servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the lords priests
 then the king said to doeg you are to put the priests to death and doeg the edomite turning on the priests and attacking them put to death that day eighty five men who took up the ephod
 and nob the town of the priests he put to the sword all the men and women children and babies at the breast and oxen and asses and sheep
 and abiathar one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub got away and went in flight after david
 and gave him the news of how saul had put to death the lords priests
 and david said to abiathar i was certain that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would take the news to saul i am responsible for the lives of all your fathers family
 keep here with me and have no fear for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours but with me you will be safe
 and they sent word to david saying the philistines are fighting against keilah and taking the grain from the grain floors
 so david questioning the lord said am i to go and make an attack on these philistines and the lord said to david go and make an attack on the philistines so that keilah may be kept from falling into their hands
 and davids men said to him even here in judah we are full of fear how much more then if we go to keilah against the armies of the philistines
 then david put the question to the lord again and the lord answering said up  go down to keilah for i will give the philistines into your hands
