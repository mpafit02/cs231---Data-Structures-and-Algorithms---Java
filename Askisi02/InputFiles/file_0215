 you blind pharisee first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate so that the outside may become equally clean
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you are like the resting places of the dead which are made white and seem beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead mens bones and of all unclean things
 even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness but inside you are all false and full of wrongdoing
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets and make fair the last resting places of good men and say
 if we had been living in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets
 so that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death
 make full then the measure of your fathers
 you snakes offspring of snakes how will you be kept from the punishment of hell
 for this reason i send you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them you will put to death and put on the cross and to some of them you will give blows in your synagogues driving them from town to town
 so that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth from the blood of upright abel to the blood of zachariah son of barachiah whom you put to death between the temple and the altar
 truly i say to you all these things will come on this generation
 o jerusalem jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her  again and again would i have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings and you would not 
 see your house is made waste
 for i say to you you will not see me from this time till you say a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 and jesus went out of the temple and on the way his disciples came to him pointing out the buildings of the temple
 but he answering said to them see you not all these things truly i say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another which will not be pulled down
 and while he was seated on the mountain of olives the disciples came to him privately saying make clear to us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world
 and jesus said to them in answer take care that you are not tricked
 for people will come in my name saying i am the christ and a number will be turned from the true way through them
 and news will come to you of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled for these things have to be but it is still not the end
 for nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom and men will be without food and the earth will be shaking in different places
 but all these things are the first of the troubles
 then they will be cruel to you and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name
 and numbers of people will be turned from the right way and will give one another up and have hate for one another
 and a number of false prophets will come causing error
 and because wrongdoing will be increased the love of most people will become cold
 but he who goes through to the end will get salvation
 and this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations and then the end will come
 when then you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction of which word was given by daniel the prophet  let this be clear to the reader 
 then let those who are in judaea go in flight to the mountains
