 and he took me to the door of the open place and looking i saw a hole in the wall
 and he said to me son of man make a hole in the wall and after making a hole in the wall i saw a door
 and he said to me go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here
 so i went in and saw and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth and unclean beasts and all the images of the children of israel were pictured round about on the wall
 and before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of israel had taken their places every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand and in the middle of them was jaazaniah the son of shaphan and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume
 and he said to me son of man have you seen what the responsible men of the children of israel do in the dark every man in his room of pictured images for they say the lord does not see us the lord has gone away from the land
 then he said to me you will see even more disgusting things which they do
 then he took me to the door of the way into the lords house looking to the north and there women were seated weeping for tammuz
 then he said to me have you seen this o son of man you will see even more disgusting things than these
 and he took me into the inner square of the lords house and at the door of the temple of the lord between the covered way and the altar there were about twenty five men with their backs turned to the temple of the lord and their faces turned to the east and they were worshipping the sun turning to the east
 then he said to me have you seen this o son of man is it a small thing to the children of judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here for they have made the land full of violent behaviour making me angry again and again and see they put the branch to my nose
 for this reason i will let loose my wrath my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity
 then crying out in my hearing in a loud voice he said let the overseers of the town come near every man armed
 and six men came from the way of the higher doorway looking to the north every man with his axe in his hand and one man among them was clothed in linen with a writers inkpot at his side and they went in and took their places by the brass altar
 and the glory of the god of israel had gone up from the winged ones on which it was resting to the doorstep of the house and crying out to the man clothed in linen who had the writers inkpot at his side
 the lord said to him go through the town through the middle of jerusalem and put a mark on the brows of the men who are sorrowing and crying for all the disgusting things which are done in it
 and to these he said in my hearing go through the town after him using your axes do not let your eyes have mercy and have no pity
 give up to destruction old men and young men and virgins little children and women but do not come near any man who has the mark on him and make a start at my holy place so they made a start with the old men who were before the house
 and he said to them make the house unclean make the open places full of dead go forward and send destruction on the town
 now while they were doing so and i was untouched i went down on my face and crying out i said ah lord  will you give all the rest of israel to destruction in letting loose your wrath on jerusalem
 then he said to me the sin of the children of israel and judah is very very great and the land is full of blood and the town full of evil ways for they say the lord has gone away from the land and the lord does not see
 and as for me my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity but i will send the punishment of their ways on their heads
 then the man clothed in linen who had the inkpot at his side came back and said i have done what you gave me orders to do
 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order that the word of the lord given by the mouth of jeremiah might come true the spirit of cyrus king of persia was moved by the lord so that he made a public statement through all his kingdom and put it in writing saying
 these are the words of cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in jerusalem which is in judah
 whoever there is among you of his people may his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and take in hand the building of the house of the lord the god of israel he is the god who is in jerusalem
 and whoever there may be of the rest of israel living in any place let the men of that place give him help with offerings of silver and gold and goods and beasts in addition to the offering freely given for the house of god in jerusalem
 then the heads of families of judah and benjamin with the priests and the levites got ready even all those whose spirits were moved by god to go up and take in hand the building of the lords house in jerusalem
 and all their neighbours gave them help with offerings of vessels of silver and gold and goods and beasts and things of great value in addition to what was freely offered
 and cyrus the king got out the vessels of the house of the lord which nebuchadnezzar had taken from jerusalem and put in the house of his gods
