 and i will give the rain at the right time and i will make the shower come down at the right time there will be showers of blessing
 and the tree of the field will give its fruit and the earth will give its increase and they will be safe in their land and they will be certain that i am the lord when i have had their yoke broken and have given them salvation from the hands of those who made them servants
 and their goods will no longer be taken by the nations and they will not again be food for the beasts of the earth but they will be living safely and no one will be a cause of fear to them
 and i will give them planting places of peace and they will no longer be wasted from need of food or put to shame by the nations
 and they will be certain that i the lord their god am with them and that they the children of israel are my people says the lord
 and you are my sheep the sheep of my grass lands and i am your god says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to mount seir and be a prophet against it
 and say to it this is what the lord has said see i am against you o mount seir and my hand will be stretched out against you and i will make you a waste and a cause for wonder
 i will make your towns unpeopled and you will be a waste and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because yours has been a hate without end and you have given up the children of israel to the power of the sword in the time of their trouble in the time of the punishment of the end
 for this cause by my life says the lord because you have been sinning through blood blood will come after you
 and i will make mount seir a cause for wonder and a waste cutting off from it all comings and goings
 i will make his mountains full of those who have been put to death in your valleys and in all your water streams men will be falling by the sword
 i will make you waste for ever and your towns will be unpeopled and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because you have said the two nations and the two countries are to be mine and we will take them for our heritage though the lord was there
 for this cause by my life says the lord i will do to you as you have done in your wrath and in your envy which you have made clear in your hate for them and i will make clear to you who i am when you are judged by me
 and you will see that i the lord have had knowledge of all the bitter things which you have said against the mountains of israel saying they have been made waste they are given to us to take for our heritage
 and you have made yourselves great against me with your mouths increasing your words against me and it has come to my ears
 this is what the lord has said because you were glad over my land when it was a waste so will i do to you
 you will become a waste o mount seir and all edom even all of it and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and you son of man be a prophet about the mountains of israel and say you mountains of israel give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said because your hater has said against you aha  and the old waste places are our heritage we have taken them
 for this cause be a prophet and say this is what the lord has said because even because they have been glad over you and put you to shame on every side because you have become a heritage for the rest of the nations and you are taken up on the lips of talkers and in the evil talk of the people
 for this reason you mountains of israel give ear to the word of the lord this is what the lord has said to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys to the unpeopled wastes and to the towns where no one is living from which the goods have been taken and which have been put to shame by the rest of the nations who are round about
 for this cause the lord has said truly in the heat of my bitter feeling i have said things against the rest of the nations and against all edom who have taken my land as a heritage for themselves with the joy of all their heart and with bitter envy of soul have made attacks on it
 for this cause be a prophet about the land of israel and say to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys this is what the lord has said truly in my bitter feeling and in my wrath i have said these things because you have undergone the shame of the nations
 for this cause the lord has said see i have taken an oath that the nations which are round about you are themselves to undergo the shame which they have put on you
 but you o mountains of israel will put out your branches and give your fruit to my people israel for they are ready to come
 for truly i am for you and i will be turned to you and you will be ploughed and planted
