 which have come to our hearing and our knowledge as they were given to us by our fathers
 we will not keep them secret from our children we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the lord and his strength and the great works of wonder which he has done
 he put up a witness in jacob and made a law in israel which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children
 so that the generation to come might have knowledge of them even the children of the future who would give word of them to their children
 so that they might put their hope in god and not let gods works go out of their minds but keep his laws
 and not be like their fathers a stiff necked and uncontrolled generation a generation whose heart was hard whose spirit was not true to god
 the children of ephraim armed with bows were turned back on the day of the fight
 they were not ruled by gods word and they would not go in the way of his law
 they let his works go out of their memory and the wonders which he had made them see
 he did great works before the eyes of their fathers in the land of egypt in the fields of zoan
 the sea was cut in two so that they might go through the waters were massed together on this side and on that
 in the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud and all through the night with a light of fire
 the rocks of the waste land were broken by his power and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters
 he made streams come out of the rock and waters came flowing down like rivers
 and they went on sinning against him even more turning away from the most high in the waste land
 testing god in their hearts requesting meat for their desire
 they said bitter words against god saying is god able to make ready a table in the waste land
 see the rock was cut open by his power so that the water came rushing out and overflowing streams is he able to give us bread is he able to get meat for his people
 so these things came to the lords ears and he was angry and a fire was lighted against jacob and wrath came up against israel
 because they had no faith in god and no hope in his salvation
 and he gave orders to the clouds on high and the doors of heaven were open
 and he sent down manna like rain for their food and gave them the grain of heaven
 man took part in the food of strong ones he sent them meat in full measure
 he sent an east wind from heaven driving on the south wind by his power
 he sent down meat on them like dust and feathered birds like the sand of the sea
 and he let it come down into their resting place round about their tents
 so they had food and were full for he gave them their desire
 but they were not turned from their desires and while the food was still in their mouths
 the wrath of god came on them and put to death the fattest of them and put an end to the young men of israel
 for all this they went on sinning even more and had no faith in his great wonders
