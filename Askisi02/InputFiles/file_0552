 then they will be certain that i am the lord when i have made the land a waste and a cause of wonder because of all the disgusting things which they have done
 and as for you son of man the children of your people are talking together about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses saying to one another come now give ear to the word which comes from the lord
 and they come to you as my people come and are seated before you as my people hearing your words but doing them not for deceit is in their mouth and their heart goes after profit for themselves
 and truly you are to them like a love song by one who has a very pleasing voice and is an expert player on an instrument for they give ear to your words but do them not
 and when this comes about  see it is coming  then it will be clear to them that a prophet has been among them
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man be a prophet against the keepers of the flock of israel and say to them o keepers of the sheep  this is the word of the lord a curse is on the keepers of the flock of israel who take the food for themselves  is it not right for the keepers to give the food to the sheep
 you take the milk and are clothed with the wool you put the fat beasts to death but you give the sheep no food
 you have not made the diseased ones strong or made well that which was ill you have not put bands on the broken or got back that which had been sent away or made search for the wandering ones and the strong you have been ruling cruelly
 and they were wandering in every direction because there was no keeper and they became food for all the beasts of the field
 and my sheep went out of the way wandering through all the mountains and on every high hill my sheep went here and there over all the face of the earth and no one was troubled about them or went in search of them
 for this cause o keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the lord
 by my life says the lord truly because my sheep have been taken away and my sheep became food for all the beasts of the field because there was no keeper and my keepers did not go in search of the sheep but the keepers took food for themselves and gave my sheep no food
 for this reason o you keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said see i am against the keepers of the flock and i will make search and see what they have done with my sheep and will let them be keepers of my sheep no longer and the keepers will no longer get food for themselves i will take my sheep out of their mouths so that they may not be food for them
 for this is what the lord has said truly i even i will go searching and looking for my sheep
 as the keeper goes looking for his flock when he is among his wandering sheep so i will go looking for my sheep and will get them safely out of all the places where they have been sent wandering in the day of clouds and black night
 and i will take them out from among the peoples and get them together from the countries and will take them into their land and i will give them food on the mountains of israel by the water streams and wherever men are living in the country
 i will give them good grass land for their food and their safe place will be the mountains of the high place of israel there they will take their rest in a good place and on fat grass land they will take their food on the mountains of israel
 i myself will give food to my flock and i will give them rest says the lord
 i will go in search of that which had gone wandering from the way and will get back that which had been sent in flight and will put bands on that which was broken and give strength to that which was ill but the fat and the strong i will give up to destruction i will give them for their food the punishment which is theirs by right
 and as for you o my flock says the lord truly i will be judge between sheep and sheep the he sheep and the he goats
 does it seem a small thing to you to have taken your food on good grass land while the rest of your grass land is stamped down under your feet and that after drinking from clear waters you make the rest of the waters dirty with your feet
 and as for my sheep their food is the grass which has been stamped on by your feet and their drink the water which has been made dirty by your feet
 for this reason the lord has said to them truly i even i will be judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep
 because you have been pushing with side and leg pushing the diseased with your horns till they were sent away in every direction
 i will make my flock safe and they will no longer be taken away and i will be judge between sheep and sheep
 and i will put over them one keeper and he will give them food even my servant david he will give them food and be their keeper
 and i the lord will be their god and my servant david their ruler i the lord have said it
 and i will make with them an agreement of peace and will put an end to evil beasts through all the land and they will be living safely in the waste land sleeping in the woods
