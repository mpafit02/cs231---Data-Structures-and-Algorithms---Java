 and the building of its wall was of jasper and the town was clear gold clear as glass
 the bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones the first base was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald
 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth the twelfth amethyst
 and the twelve doors were twelve pearls every door was made of one pearl and the street of the town was clear gold as clear as glass
 and i saw no temple there because the lord god the ruler of all and the lamb are its temple
 and the town has no need of the sun or of the moon to give it light for the glory of god did make it light and the light of it is the lamb
 and the nations will go in its light and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it
 and the doors of it will never be shut by day  for there is no night there 
 and the glory and honour of the nations will come into it
 and nothing unclean may come into it or anyone whose works are cursed or false but only those whose names are in the lambs book of life
 and i saw a river of water of life clear as glass coming out of the high seat of god and of the lamb
 in the middle of its street and on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life having twelve sorts of fruits giving its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations
 and there will be no more curse and the high seat of god and of the lamb will be there and his servants will be worshipping him
 and they will see his face and his name will be on their brows
 and there will be no more night and they have no need of a light or of the shining of the sun for the lord god will give them light and they will be ruling for ever and ever
 and he said to me these words are certain and true and the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to make clear to his servants the things which are now to come about
 see i come quickly a blessing on him who keeps the words of this book of the prophet
 and i john am he who saw these things and to whose ears they came and when i had seen and given ear i went down on my face to give worship at the feet of the angel who made these things clear to me
 and he said to me see you do it not i am a brother servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book give worship to god
 and he said to me let not the words of this prophets book be kept secret because the time is near
 let the evil man go on in his evil and let the unclean be still unclean and let the upright go on in his righteousness and let the holy be holy still
 see i come quickly and my reward is with me to give to every man the outcome of his works
 i am the first and the last the start and the end
 a blessing on those whose robes are washed so that they may have a right to the tree of life and may go in by the doors into the town
 outside are the dogs and those who make use of evil powers those who make themselves unclean and the takers of l and to the angel of the church in sardis say these things says he who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i have knowledge of your works that you seem to be living but are dead
 be on the watch and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death because as judged by me your works have not come up to gods measure
 keep in mind then the teaching which was given to you and be ruled by it and have a change of heart if then you do not keep watch i will come like a thief and you will have no knowledge of the hour when i will come on you
 but you have some names in sardis who have kept clean their robes and as a reward they will go in white with me
 he who overcomes will be dressed in white and i will not take his name from the book of life and i will give witness to his name before my father and before his angels
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
