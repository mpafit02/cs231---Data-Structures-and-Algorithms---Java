 but jesus said to them you have no knowledge of what you are saying are you able to take of my cup or to undergo the baptism which i am to undergo
 and they said to him we are able and jesus said to them you will take of the cup from which i take and the baptism which i am about to undergo you will undergo
 but to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom it has been made ready
 and hearing this the ten became very angry with james and john
 and jesus made them come to him and said to them you see that those who are made rulers over the gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
 but it is not so among you but whoever has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
 and whoever has a desire to be first among you let him be servant of all
 for truly the son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
 and they came to jericho and when he was going out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people the son of timaeus bartimaeus a blind man was seated by the wayside with his hand out for money
 and when it came to his ears that it was jesus of nazareth he gave a cry and said jesus son of david have mercy on me
 and some of them turning in protest gave him an order to be quiet but he went on crying out all the more son of david have mercy on me
 and jesus came to a stop and said let him come and crying out to the blind man they said to him be comforted come he has sent for you
 and he putting off his coat got up quickly and came to jesus
 and jesus said to him what would you have me do to you and the blind man said master make me able to see
 and jesus said to him go on your way your faith has made you well and straight away he was able to see and went after him in the way
 and when they came near to jerusalem to beth phage and bethany at the mountain of olives he sent two of his disciples
 and said to them go into the little town opposite and when you come to it you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and come back with him
 and if anyone says to you why are you doing this say the lord has need of him and will send him back straight away
 and they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street and they were getting him loose
 and some of those who were there said to them what are you doing taking the ass
 and they said to them the words which jesus had said and they let them go
 and they took the young ass to jesus and put their clothing on him and he got on his back
 and a great number put down their clothing in the way and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields
 and those who went in front and those who came after were crying glory a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 a blessing on the coming kingdom of our father david glory in the highest
 and he went into jerusalem into the temple and after looking round about on all things it being now evening he went out to bethany with the twelve
 and on the day after when they had come out from bethany he was in need of food
 and seeing a fig tree in the distance with leaves he went to see if by chance it had anything on it and when he came to it he saw nothing but leaves for it was not the time for the fruit
 and he said to it let no man take fruit from you for ever and his disciples took note of his words
 and they came to jerusalem and he went into the temple and sent out those who were trading there overturning the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money
