 my god has sent his angel to keep the lions mouths shut and they have done me no damage because i was seen to be without sin before him and further before you o king i have done no wrong
 then the king was very glad and gave orders for them to take daniel up out of the hole so daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched because he had faith in his god
 and at the kings order they took those men who had said evil against daniel and put them in the lions hole with their wives and their children and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame them and all their bones were broken
 then king darius sent a letter to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth may your peace be increased
 it is my order that in all the kingdom of which i am ruler men are to be shaking with fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god unchanging for ever and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction his rule will go on to the end
 he gives salvation and makes men free from danger and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth who has kept daniel safe from the power of the lions
 so this daniel did well in the kingdom of darius and in the kingdom of cyrus the persian
 in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel saw a dream and visions came into his head on his bed then he put the dream in writing
 i had a vision by night and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea
 and four great beasts came up from the sea different one from another
 the first was like a lion and had eagles wings while i was watching its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man and a mans heart was given to it
 and i saw another beast like a bear and it was lifted up on one side and three side bones were in its mouth between its teeth and they said to it up  take much flesh
 after this i saw another beast like a leopard which had on its back four wings like those of a bird and the beast had four heads and the power of a ruler was given to it
 after this in my vision of the night i saw a fourth beast a thing causing fear and very troubling full of power and very strong and it had great iron teeth it took its food crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet it was different from all the beasts before it and it had ten horns
 i was watching the horns with care and i saw another coming up among them a little one before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots and there were eyes like a mans eyes in this horn and a mouth saying great things
 i went on looking till the seats of kings were placed and one like a very old man took his seat his clothing was white as snow and the hair of his head was like clean wool his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire
 a stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him a thousand thousands were his servants and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him the judge was seated and the books were open
 then i saw  because of the voice of the great words which the horn said  i saw till the beast was put to death and its body was given to destruction and the beast was given to the burning of fire
 as for the rest of the beasts their authority was taken away but they let them go on living for a measure of time
 i saw in visions of the night and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man and he came to the one who was very old and they took him near before him
 and to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom and all peoples nations and languages were his servants his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction
 as for me daniel my spirit was pained because of this and the visions of my head were troubling me
 i came near to one of those who were waiting there questioning him about what all this was and he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things
 these great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth
 but the saints of the most high will take the kingdom and it will be theirs for ever even for ever and ever
 then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast which was different from all the others a cause of great fear whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass who took his food crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet
 and about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up causing the fall of three that horn which had eyes and a mouth saying great things which seemed to be greater than the other horns
 and i saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them
 till he came who was very old and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the most high and the time came when the saints took the kingdom
 this is what he said the fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth different from all the kingdoms and it will overcome all the earth crushing it down and smashing it
