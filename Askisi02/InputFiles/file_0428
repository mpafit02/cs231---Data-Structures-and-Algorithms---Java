 truly you will take up saccuth your king and kaiwan your images the star of your god which you made for yourselves
 and i will send you away as prisoners farther than damascus says the lord whose name is the god of armies
 sorrow to those who are resting in comfort in zion and to those who have no fear of danger in the mountain of samaria the noted men of the chief of the nations to whom the people of israel come 
 go on to calneh and see and from there go to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines are you better than these kingdoms or is your land wider than theirs
 you who put far away the evil day causing the rule of the violent to come near
 who are resting on beds of ivory stretched out on soft seats feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattle house
 making foolish songs to the sound of corded instruments and designing for themselves instruments of music like david
 drinking wine in basins rubbing themselves with the best oils but they have no grief for the destruction of joseph
 so now they will go away prisoners with the first of those who are made prisoners and the loud cry of those who were stretched out will come to an end
 the lord god has taken an oath by himself says the lord the god of armies the pride of jacob is disgusting to me and i have hate for his great houses so i will give up the town with everything in it
 then it will come about that if there are still ten men in a house death will overtake them
 and when a mans relation even the one who is responsible for burning his body lifting him up to take his bones out of the house says to him who is in the inmost part of the house is there still anyone with you and he says no then he will say keep quiet for the name of the lord may not be named
 for see at the order of the lord the great house will be full of cracks and the little house will be broken
 is it possible for horses to go running on the rock may the sea be ploughed with oxen for the right to be turned by you into poison and the fruit of righteousness into a bitter plant
 you whose joy is in a thing of no value who say have we not taken for ourselves horns by the strength which is ours
 for see i will send against you a nation o israel says the lord the god of armies ruling you cruelly from the way into hamath as far as the stream of the arabah
 this is what the lord god let me see and i saw that when the growth of the late grass was starting he made locusts it was the late growth after the kings cutting was done
 and it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land i said o lord god have mercy how will jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
 the lord changing his purpose about this said it will not be
 this is what the lord let me see and i saw that the lord god sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment and after burning up the great deep it was about to put an end to the lords heritage
 then said i o lord god let there be an end how will jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
 the lord changing his purpose about this said and this will not be
 this is what he let me see and i saw the lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line and he had a weighted line in his hand
 and the lord said to me amos what do you see and i said a weighted line then the lord said see i will let down a weighted line among my people israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
 and the high places of isaac will be unpeopled and the holy places of israel will be made waste and i will come up against the family of jeroboam with the sword
 then amaziah the priest of beth el sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos has made designs against you among the people of israel the land is troubled by his words
 for amos has said jeroboam will be put to the sword and israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land
 and amaziah said to amos o seer go in flight into the land of judah and there get your living by working as a prophet
 but be a prophet no longer at beth el for it is the holy place of the king and the kings house
 then amos in answer said to amaziah i am no prophet or one of the sons of the prophets i am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamore trees
