 i am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way
 as for you the spirit which he gave you is still in you and you have no need of any teacher but as his spirit gives you teaching about all things and is true and not false so keep your hearts in him through the teaching which he has given you
 and now my children keep your hearts in him so that at his revelation we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming
 if you have knowledge that he is upright it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring
 see what great love the father has given us in naming us the children of god and such we are for this reason the world does not see who we are because it did not see who he was
 my loved ones now we are children of god and at present it is not clear what we are to be we are certain that at his revelation we will be like him for we will see him as he is
 and everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy even as he is holy
 everyone who is a sinner goes against the law for sin is going against the law
 and you have knowledge that he came to take away sin and in him there is no sin
 anyone who is in him does no sin anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him
 my little children let no man take you out of the true way he who does righteousness is upright even as he is upright
 the sinner is a child of the evil one for the evil one has been a sinner from the first and the son of god was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the evil one
 anyone who is a child of god does no sin because he still has gods seed in him he is not able to be a sinner because god is his father
 in this way it is clear who are the children of god and who are the children of the evil one anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother is not a child of god
 because this is the word which was given to you from the first that we are to have love for one another
 not being of the evil one like cain who put his brother to death and why did he put him to death because his works were evil and his brothers works were good
 do not be surprised my brothers if the world has no love for you
 we are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers he who has no love is still in death
 anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him
 in this we see what love is because he gave his life for us and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers
 but if a man has this worlds goods and sees that his brother is in need and keeps his heart shut against his brother how is it possible for the love of god to be in him
 my little children do not let our love be in word and in tongue but let it be in act and in good faith
 in this way we may be certain that we are true and may give our heart comfort before him
 when our heart says that we have done wrong because god is greater than our heart and has knowledge of all things
 my loved ones if our heart does not say that we have done wrong we have no fear before him
 and he gives us all our requests because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes
 and this is his law that we have faith in the name of his son jesus christ and love for one another even as he said to us
 he who keeps his laws is in god and god is in him and the spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us
 my loved ones do not put your faith in every spirit but put them to the test to see if they are from god because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world
 by this you may have knowledge of the spirit of god every spirit which says that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god
