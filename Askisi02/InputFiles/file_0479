 all the work of man is for his mouth and still he has a desire for food
 what have the wise more than the foolish and what has the poor man by walking wisely before the living
 what the eyes see is better than the wandering of desire this is to no purpose and a desire for wind
 that which is has been named before and of what man is there is knowledge he has no power against one stronger than he
 there are words without number for increasing what is to no purpose but what is man profited by them
 who is able to say what is good for man in life all the days of his foolish life which he goes through like a shade who will say what is to be after him under the sun
 a good name is better than oil of great price and the day of death than the day of birth
 it is better to go to the house of weeping than to go to the house of feasting because that is the end of every man and the living will take it to their hearts
 sorrow is better than joy when the face is sad the mind gets better
 the hearts of the wise are in the house of weeping but the hearts of the foolish are in the house of joy
 it is better to take note of the protest of the wise than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish
 like the cracking of thorns under a pot so is the laugh of a foolish man and this again is to no purpose
 the wise are troubled by the ways of the cruel and the giving of money is the destruction of the heart
 the end of a thing is better than its start and a gentle spirit is better than pride
 be not quick to let your spirit be angry because wrath is in the heart of the foolish
 say not why were the days which have gone by better than these such a question comes not from wisdom
 wisdom together with a heritage is good and a profit to those who see the sun
 wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner
 give thought to the work of god who will make straight what he has made bent
 in the day of wealth have joy but in the day of evil take thought god has put the one against the other so that man may not be certain what will be after him
 these two have i seen in my life which is to no purpose a good man coming to his end in his righteousness and an evil man whose days are long in his evil doing
 be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over wise why let destruction come on you
 be not evil overmuch and be not foolish why come to your end before your time
 it is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that he who has the fear of god will be free of the two
 wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town
 there is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days
 do not give ear to all the words which men say for fear of hearing the curses of your servant
 your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you
 all this i have put to the test by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me
 far off is true existence and very deep who may have knowledge of it
