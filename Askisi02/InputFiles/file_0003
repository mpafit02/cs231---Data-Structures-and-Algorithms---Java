 if then anyone takes the bread or the cup of the lord in the wrong spirit he will be responsible for the body and blood of the lord
 but let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself
 for a man puts himself in danger if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the lords body
 for this cause a number of you are feeble and ill and a number are dead
 but if we were true judges of ourselves punishment would not come on us
 but if punishment does come it is sent by the lord so that we may be safe when the world is judged
 so then my brothers when you come together to the holy meal of the lord let there be waiting for one another
 if any man is in need of food let him take his meal in his house so that you may not come together to your damage and the rest i will put in order when i come
 but about the things of the spirit my brothers it is not right for you to be without teaching
 you are conscious that when you were gentiles in whatever way you were guided you went after images without voice or power
 so it is my desire for you to be clear about this that no one is able to say by the spirit of god that jesus is cursed and no one is able to say that jesus is lord but by the holy spirit
 now there are different qualities given to men but the same spirit
 and there are different sorts of servants but the same lord
 and there are different operations but the same god who is working all things in all
 but to every man some form of the spirits working is given for the common good
 for to one are given words of wisdom through the spirit and to another words of knowledge through the same spirit
 to another faith in the same spirit and to another the power of taking away disease by the one spirit
 and to another the power of working wonders and to another the prophets word and to another the power of testing spirits to another different sorts of tongues and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues
 but all these are the operations of the one and the same spirit giving to every man separately as his pleasure is
 for as the body is one and has a number of parts and all the parts make one body so is christ
 for through the baptism of the one spirit we were all formed into one body jews or greeks servants or free men and were all made full of the same spirit
 for the body is not one part but a number of parts
 if the foot says because i am not the hand i am not a part of the body it is no less a part of the body
 and if the ear says because i am not the eye i am not a part of the body it is a part of the body all the same
 if all the body was an eye where would be the hearing if all was hearing where would be the smelling
 but now god has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him
 and if they were all one part where would the body be
 but now they are all different parts but one body
 and the eye may not say to the hand i have no need of you or again the head to the feet i have no need of you
 no those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary
