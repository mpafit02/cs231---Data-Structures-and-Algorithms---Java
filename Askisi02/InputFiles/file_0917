 childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of children is their fathers
 fair words are not to be looked for from a foolish man much less are false lips in a ruler
 an offering of money is like a stone of great price in the eyes of him who has it wherever he goes he does well
 he who keeps a sin covered is looking for love but he who keeps on talking of a thing makes division between friends
 a word of protest goes deeper into one who has sense than a hundred blows into a foolish man
 an uncontrolled man is only looking for trouble so a cruel servant will be sent against him
 it is better to come face to face with a bear whose young ones have been taken away than with a foolish man acting foolishly
 if anyone gives back evil for good evil will never go away from his house
 the start of fighting is like the letting out of water so give up before it comes to blows
 he who gives a decision for the evil doer and he who gives a decision against the upright are equally disgusting to the lord
 how will money in the hand of the foolish get him wisdom seeing that he has no sense
 a friend is loving at all times and becomes a brother in times of trouble
 a man without sense gives his hand in an agreement and makes himself responsible before his neighbour
 the lover of fighting is a lover of sin he who makes high his doorway is looking for destruction
 nothing good comes to him whose heart is fixed on evil purposes and he who has an evil tongue will come to trouble
 he who has an unwise son gets sorrow for himself and the father of a foolish son has no joy
 a glad heart makes a healthy body but a crushed spirit makes the bones dry
 a sinner takes an offering out of his robe to get a decision for himself in a cause
 wisdom is before the face of him who has sense but the eyes of the foolish are on the ends of the earth
 a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitter pain to her who gave him birth
 to give punishment to the upright is not good or to give blows to the noble for their righteousness
 he who has knowledge says little and he who has a calm spirit is a man of good sense
 even the foolish man when he keeps quiet is taken to be wise when his lips are shut he is credited with good sense
 he who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense
 a foolish man has no pleasure in good sense but only to let what is in his heart come to light
 when the evil doer comes a low opinion comes with him and with the loss of honour comes shame
 the words of a mans mouth are like deep waters the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing stream
 to have respect for the person of the evil doer is not good or to give a wrong decision against the upright
 a foolish mans lips are a cause of fighting and his mouth makes him open to blows
 the mouth of a foolish man is his destruction and his lips are a net for his soul
