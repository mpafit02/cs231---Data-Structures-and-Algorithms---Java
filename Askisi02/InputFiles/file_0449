 then keep the feast of weeks to the lord your god with an offering freely given to him from the wealth he has given you
 then you are to be glad before the lord your god you and your son and your daughter your man servant and your woman servant and the levite who is with you and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you in the place marked out by the lord your god as a resting place for his name
 and you will keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt and you will take care to keep all these laws
 you are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine
 you are to keep the feast with joy you and your son and your daughter your man servant and your woman servant and the levite and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you
 keep the feast to the lord your god for seven days in the place marked out by the lord because the blessing of the lord your god will be on all the produce of your land and all the work of your hands and you will have nothing but joy
 three times in the year let all your males come before the lord your god in the place named by him at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents and they are not to come before the lord with nothing in their hands
 every man is to give as he is able in the measure of the blessing which the lord your god has given you
 you are to make judges and overseers in all your towns which the lord your god gives you for every tribe and they are to be upright men judging the people in righteousness
 you are not to be moved in your judging by a mans position you are not to take rewards for rewards make the eyes of the wise man blind and the decisions of the upright false
 let righteousness be your guide so that you may have life and take for your heritage the land which the lord your god is giving you
 let no holy tree of any sort be planted by the altar of the lord your god which you will make
 you are not to put up stone pillars for they are hated by the lord your god
 no ox or sheep which has a mark on it or is damaged in any way may be offered to the lord your god for that is disgusting to the lord your god
 if there is any man or woman among you in any of the towns which the lord your god gives you who does evil in the eyes of the lord your god sinning against his agreement
 by becoming a servant of other gods and worshipping them or the sun or the moon or all the stars of heaven against my orders
 if word of this comes to your ears then let this thing be looked into with care and if there is no doubt that it is true and such evil has been done in israel
 then you are to take the man or woman who has done the evil to the public place of your town and they are to be stoned with stones till they are dead
 on the word of two or three witnesses a man may be given the punishment of death but he is not to be put to death on the word of one witness
 the hands of the witnesses will be the first to put him to death and after them the hands of all the people so you are to put away the evil from among you
 if you are not able to give a decision as to who is responsible for a death or who is right in a cause or who gave the first blow in a fight and there is a division of opinion about it in your town then go to the place marked out by the lord your god
 and come before the priests the levites or before him who is judge at the time and they will go into the question and give you a decision
 and you are to be guided by the decision they give in the place named by the lord and do whatever they say
 acting in agreement with their teaching and the decision they give not turning to one side or the other from the word they have given you
 and any man who in his pride will not give ear to the priest whose place is there before the lord your god or to the judge is to be put to death you are to put away the evil from israel
 and all the people hearing of it will be full of fear and put away their pride
 when you have come into the land which the lord your god is giving you and have taken it for a heritage and are living in it if it is your desire to have a king over you like the other nations round about you
 then see that you take as your king the man named by the lord your god let your king be one of your countrymen not a man of another nation who is not one of yourselves
 and he is not to get together a great army of horses for himself or make the people go back to egypt to get horses for him because the lord has said you will never again go back that way
 and he is not to have a great number of wives for fear that his heart may be turned away or great wealth of silver and gold
