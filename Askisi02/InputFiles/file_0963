 he sent signs and wonders among you o egypt on pharaoh and on all his servants
 he overcame great nations and put strong kings to death
 sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the kingdoms of canaan
 and gave their land for a heritage even for a heritage to israel his people
 o lord your name is eternal and the memory of you will have no end
 for the lord will be judge of his peoples cause his feelings will be changed to his servants
 the images of the nations are silver and gold the work of mens hands
 they have mouths but no voice they have eyes but they do not see
 they have ears but no hearing and there is no breath in their mouths
 those who make them are like them and so is everyone who puts his hope in them
 give praise to the lord o children of israel give praise to the lord o sons of aaron
 give praise to the lord o sons of levi let all the worshippers of the lord give him praise
 praise be to the lord out of zion even to the lord whose house is in jerusalem let the lord be praised
 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 o give praise to the god of gods for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 o give praise to the lord of lords for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who only does great wonders for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him by whom the earth was stretched out over the waters for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who made great lights for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 the sun to have rule by day for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 the moon and the stars to have rule by night for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who put to death the first fruits of egypt for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and took out israel from among them for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 with a strong hand and an outstretched arm for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who made a way through the red sea for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and let israel go through it for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 by him pharaoh and his army were overturned in the red sea for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who took his people through the waste land for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 to him who overcame great kings for his mercy is unchanging for ever
