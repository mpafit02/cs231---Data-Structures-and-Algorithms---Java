 and the name of the daughter of asher was serah
 these are the families of the sons of asher as they were numbered fifty three thousand four hundred
 the sons of naphtali by their families of jahzeel the family of the jahzeelites of guni the family of the gunites
 of jezer the family of the jezerites of shillem the family of the shillemites
 these are the families of naphtali by their families and those who were numbered of them were forty five thousand four hundred
 those who were numbered of the children of israel were six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty
 and the lord said to moses
 let there be a division of the land among these for their heritage in relation to the number of names
 to those families who are more in number give a greater heritage to those who are less in number a smaller part to every one let the heritage be given in relation to the number in his family
 but let the distribution of the land be made by the decision of the lord by the names of the tribes of their fathers let their heritage be given them
 as it is ordered by the decision of the lord let distribution be made between those who are more in number and those who are less
 these were those of the levites who were numbered by their families of gershon the family of the gershonites of kohath the family of the kohathites of merari the family of the merarites
 these are the families of levi the family of the libnites the family of the hebronites the family of the mahlites the family of the mushites the family of the korahites and kohath was the father of amram
 amrams wife was jochebed the daughter of levi whom he had in egypt by amram she had moses and aaron and their sister miriam
 aarons sons were nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
 death overtook nadab and abihu when they made an offering of strange fire before the lord
 of these twenty three thousand males from one month old and over were numbered they were not numbered with the rest of the children of israel for they had no heritage among the children of israel
 all these were numbered by moses and eleazar the priest when the children of israel were numbered in the lowlands of moab by the jordan at jericho
 but among all these was not one of those numbered by moses and aaron the priest when the children of israel were numbered in the waste land of sinai
 for the lord had said of them death will certainly overtake them in the waste land and of them all only caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun were still living
 then the daughters of zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of manasseh the son of joseph came forward their names are mahlah noah and hoglah and milcah and tirzah
 they came before moses and eleazar the priest and the chiefs and all the people at the door of the tent of meeting and said
 death overtook our father in the waste land he was not among those who were banded together with korah against the lord but death came to him in his sin and he had no sons
 why is the name of our father to be taken away from among his family because he had no son give us a heritage among our fathers brothers
 so moses put their cause before the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 what the daughters of zelophehad say is right certainly you are to give them a heritage among their fathers brothers and let the property which would have been their fathers go to them
 and say to the children of israel if a man has no son at the time of his death let his heritage go to his daughter
 and if he has no daughter then give his heritage to his brothers
 and if he has no brothers then give his heritage to his fathers brothers
