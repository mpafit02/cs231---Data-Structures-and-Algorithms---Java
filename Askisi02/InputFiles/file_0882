 and balak made offerings of oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and the chiefs who were with him
 and in the morning balak took balaam up to the high places of baal and from there he was able to see the outer limits of the people
 and balaam said to balak make me here seven altars and get ready seven oxen and seven male sheep
 and balak did as balaam had said and balak and balaam made an offering on every altar of an ox and a male sheep
 then balaam said to balak take your place by your burned offering and i will go and see if the lord comes to me and i will give you word of whatever he says to me and he went to an open place on a hill
 and god came to balaam and balaam said to him i have made ready seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 and the lord put words in balaams mouth and said go back to balak and this is what you are to say
 so he went back to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with all the chiefs of moab
 and in the words which the lord had given him he said from aram balak has sent for me the king of moab from the mountains of the east come put curses on jacob for me and be angry with israel
 how may i put curses on him who is not cursed by god how may i be angry with him with whom the lord is not angry
 from the top of the rocks i see him looking down on him from the hills it is a people made separate not to be numbered among the nations
 who is able to take the measure of the dust of jacob or the number of the thousands of israel may my death be the death of the upright and my last end like his 
 then balak said to balaam what have you done to me i sent for you so that my haters might be cursed and see you have given them a blessing
 and in answer he said am i not ordered to say only what the lord puts into my mouth
 and balak said to him come with me now into another place from which you will not be able to see them all but only the outskirts of them and you will send curses on them from there
 so he took him into the country of zophim to the top of pisgah and there they made seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 then he said to balak take your place here by your burned offering while i go over there to the lord
 and the lord came to balaam and put words in his mouth and said go back to balak and this is what you are to say
 so he came to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with the chiefs of moab by his side and balak said to him what has the lord said
 and in the words which the lord had given him he said up  balak and give ear give attention to me o son of zippor
 god is not a man to say what is false or the son of man that his purpose may be changed what he has said will he not do and will he not give effect to the words of his mouth
 see i have had orders to give blessing and he has given a blessing which i have no power to take away
 he has seen no evil in jacob or wrongdoing in israel the lord his god is with him and the glad cry of a king is among them
 it is god who has taken them out of egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox
 no evil power has effect against jacob no secret arts against israel at the right time it will be said of jacob and of israel see what god has done 
 see israel comes up like a she lion lifting himself up like a lion he will take no rest till he has made a meal of those he has overcome drinking the blood of those he has put to death
 then balak said to balaam if you will not put a curse on them at all events do not give them a blessing
 but balaam in answer said to balak did i not say to you i may only do what the lord says
 then balak said to balaam come now i will take you to another place it may be that god will let you put a curse on them from there
 so balak took balaam to the top of peor looking down over the waste land
