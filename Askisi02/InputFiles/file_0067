 and having got it up they put cords under and round the ship but fearing that they might be pushed on to the syrtis they let down the sails and so went running before the wind
 and still fighting the storm with all our strength the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship
 and on the third day they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side
 and as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time and a great storm was on us all hope of salvation was gone
 and when they had been without food for a long time paul got up among them and said friends it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from crete to undergo this damage and loss
 but now i say to you be of good heart for there will be no loss of life but only of the ship
 for this night there came to my side an angel of the god who is my master and whose servant i am
 saying have no fear paul for you will come before caesar and god has given to you all those who are sailing with you
 and so o men be of good heart for i have faith in god that it will be as he said to me
 but we will be sent on to a certain island
 but when the fourteenth day came while we were going here and there in the adriatic sea about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land
 and they let down the lead and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet
 then fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks they let down four hooks from the back of the ship and made prayers for the coming of day
 then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship
 but paul said to the captain and his men if you do not keep these men in the ship you will not be safe
 then the armed men cutting the cords of the boat let her go
 and when dawn was near paul gave them all orders to take food saying this is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food
 so i make request to you to take food for this is for your salvation not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction
 and when he had said this and had taken bread he gave praise to god before them all and took a meal of the broken bread
 then they all took heart and did the same
 and we were in the ship two hundred and seventy six persons
 and when they had had enough food they made the weight of the ship less turning the grain out into the sea
 and when it was day they had no knowledge of the land but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible
 so cutting away the hooks and letting them go into the sea and freeing the cords of the guiding blades and lifting up the sail to the wind they went in the direction of the inlet
 and coming to a point between two seas they got the ship to land and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved but the back part was broken by the force of the waves
 then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death so that no one would get away by swimming
 but the captain desiring to keep paul safe kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land
 and the rest some on boards and some on things from the ship and so it came about that they all got safe to land
 and when we were safe we made the discovery that the island was named melita
 and the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us for they made a fire for us and took us in because it was raining and cold
