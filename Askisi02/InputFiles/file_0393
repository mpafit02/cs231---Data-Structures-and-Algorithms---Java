 then pharaoh necoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in place of josiah his father changing his name to jehoiakim but jehoahaz he took away to egypt where he was till his death
 and jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to pharaoh taxing the land by his orders to get the money the people of the land had to give silver and gold everyone as he was taxed to make the payment to pharaoh necoh
 jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was zebidah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his fathers had done
 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim was his servant for three years then he took up arms against him
 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldaeans and of the edomites and of the moabites and of the children of ammon sending them against judah for its destruction as he had said by his servants the prophets
 only by the word of the lord did this fate come on judah to take them away from before his face because of the sins of manasseh and all the evil he did
 and because of the death of those who had done no wrong for he made jerusalem full of the blood of the upright and the lord had no forgiveness for it
 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 so jehoiakim went to rest with his fathers and jehoiachin his son became king in his place
 and the king of egypt did not come out of his land again for the king of babylon had taken all his country from the stream of egypt to the river euphrates
 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months and his mothers name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his father had done
 at that time the armies of nebuchadnezzar came up to jerusalem and the town was shut in on every side
 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came there while his servants were shutting in the town
 then jehoiachin king of judah went out to the king of babylon with his mother and his servants and his chiefs and his unsexed servants and in the eighth year of his rule the king of babylon took him
 and he took away all the stored wealth of the lords house and the goods from the kings store house cutting up all the gold vessels which solomon king of israel had made in the house of the lord as the lord had said
 and he took away all the people of jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war ten thousand prisoners and all the expert workmen and the metal workers only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away
 he took jehoiachin a prisoner to babylon with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land he took them all as prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 and all the men of war seven thousand of them and a thousand expert workmen and metal workers all of them strong and able to take up arms the king of babylon took away as prisoners into babylon
 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his fathers brother king in place of jehoiachin changing his name to zedekiah
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he was king in jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah of libnah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as jehoiakim had done
 and because of the wrath of the lord this came about in jerusalem and judah till he had sent them all away from before him and zedekiah took up arms against the king of babylon
 now in the ninth year of his rule on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it building earthworks all round the town
 and the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of king zedekiah
 now on the ninth day of the fourth month the store of food in the town was almost gone so that there was no food for the people of the land
 so an opening was made in the wall of the town and all the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the kings garden  now the chaldaeans were stationed round the town  and the king went by the way of the arabah
 but the chaldaean army went after the king and overtook him in the lowlands of jericho and all his army went in flight from him in every direction
 and they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of babylon at riblah to be judged
