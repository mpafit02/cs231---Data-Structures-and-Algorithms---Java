 and let the overseers go on to say to the people if there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble
 then after saying these words to the people let the overseers put captains over the army
 when you come to a town before attacking it make an offer of peace
 and if it gives you back an answer of peace opening its doors to you then all the people in it may be put to forced work as your servants
 if however it will not make peace with you but war then let it be shut in on all sides
 and when the lord your god has given it into your hands let every male in it be put to death without mercy
 but the women and the children and the cattle and everything in the town and all its wealth you may take for yourselves the wealth of your haters which the lord your god has given you will be your food
 so you are to do to all the towns far away which are not the towns of these nations
 but in the towns of these peoples whose land the lord your god is giving you for your heritage let no living thing be kept from death
 give them up to the curse the hittite the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite as the lord your god has given you orders
 so that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods so sinning against the lord your god
 if in war a town is shut in by your armies for a long time do not let its trees be cut down and made waste for their fruit will be your food are the trees of the countryside men for you to take up arms against them
 only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken
 if in the land which the lord your god is giving you you come across the dead body of a man in the open country and you have no idea who has put him to death
 then your responsible men and your judges are to come out and give orders for the distance from the dead body to the towns round about it to be measured
 and whichever town is nearest to the body the responsible men of that town are to take from the herd a young cow which has never been used for work or put under the yoke
 and they are to take the cow into a valley where there is flowing water and which is not ploughed or planted and there the neck of the cow is to be broken
 then the priests the sons of levi are to come near for they have been marked out by the lord your god to be his servants and to give blessings in the name of the lord and by their decision every argument and every blow is to be judged
 and all the responsible men of that town which is nearest to the dead man washing their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the valley
 will say this death is not the work of our hands and our eyes have not seen it
 have mercy o lord on your people israel whom you have made free and take away from your people the crime of a death without cause then they will no longer be responsible for the mans death
 so you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you when you do what is right in the eyes of the lord
 when you go out to war against other nations and the lord your god gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners
 if among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife
 then take her back to your house and let her hair and her nails be cut
 and let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your wife
 but if you have no delight in her you are to let her go wherever she will you may not take a price for her as if she was your property for you have made use of her for your pleasure
 if a man has two wives one greatly loved and the other hated and the two of them have had children by him and if the first son is the child of the hated wife
 then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son the son of the hated wife
 but he is to give his first son his birthright and twice as great a part of his property for he is the first fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his
