 and the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true and keep the vision secret for it has to do with the far off future
 and i daniel was ill for some days then i got up and did the kings business and i was full of wonder at the vision but no one was able to give the sense of it
 in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes who was made king over the kingdom of the chaldaeans
 in the first year of his rule i daniel saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the lord to the prophet jeremiah in which the making waste of jerusalem was to be complete that is seventy years
 and turning my face to the lord god i gave myself up to prayer requesting his grace going without food in haircloth and dust
 and i made prayer to the lord my god putting our sins before him and said o lord the great god greatly to be feared keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders
 we are sinners acting wrongly and doing evil we have gone against you turning away from your orders and from your laws
 we have not given ear to your servants the prophets who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land
 o lord righteousness is yours but shame is on us even to this day and on the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and on all israel those who are near and those who are far off in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you
 o lord shame is on us on our kings and our rulers and our fathers because of our sin against you
 with the lord our god are mercies and forgiveness for we have gone against him
 and have not given ear to the voice of the lord our god to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets
 and all israel have been sinners against your law turning away so as not to give ear to your voice and the curse has been let loose on us and the oath recorded in the law of moses the servant of god for we have done evil against him
 and he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges by sending a great evil on us for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to jerusalem
 as it was recorded in the law of moses all this evil has come on us but we have made no prayer for grace from the lord our god that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom
 so the lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us for the lord our god is upright in all his acts which he has done and we have not given ear to his voice
 and now o lord our god who took your people out of the land of egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day we are sinners we have done evil
 o lord because of your righteousness let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town jerusalem your holy mountain because through our sins and the evil doing of our fathers jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all who are round about us
 and now give ear o our god to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste because of your servants o lord
 o my god let your ear be turned and give hearing let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness but because of your great mercies
 o lord give ear o lord have forgiveness o lord take note and do let there be no more waiting for the honour of your name o my god because your town and your people are named by your name
 and while i was still saying these words in prayer and putting my sins and the sins of my people israel before the lord and requesting grace from the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god
 even while i was still in prayer the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering
 and teaching me and talking to me he said o daniel i have come now to give you wisdom
 at the first word of your prayer a word went out and i have come to give you knowledge for you are a man dearly loved so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you
 seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit and for the clearing away of evil doing and the coming in of eternal righteousness so that the vision and the word of the prophet may be stamped as true and to put the holy oil on a most holy place
 have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of jerusalem till the coming of a prince on whom the holy oil has been put will be seven weeks in sixty two weeks its building will be complete with square and earthwork
 and at the end of the times even after the sixty two weeks one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no  and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince and the end will come with an overflowing of waters and even to the end there will be war the making waste which has been fixed
 and a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste
 these are the words which moses said to all israel on the far side of jordan in the waste land in the arabah opposite suph between paran on the one side and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab on the other
