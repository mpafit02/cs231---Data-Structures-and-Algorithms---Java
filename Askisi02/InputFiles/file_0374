 and king solomon and all the men of israel who had come together there with him were before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
 and the priests took the ark of the lords agreement and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
 for their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
 the rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
 nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which moses put there at horeb where the lord made an agreement with the children of israel when they came out of egypt
 now when the priests had come out of the holy place  for all the priests who were present had made themselves holy not keeping to their divisions
 and the levites who made the music all of them asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and brothers robed in fair linen were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing horns 
 and when the players on horns and those who made melody in song with one voice were sounding the praise and glory of the lord with loud voices and with wind instruments and brass and corded instruments of music praising the lord and saying he is good his mercy is unchanging for ever then the house was full of the cloud of the glory of the lord
 so that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of god was full of the glory of the lord
 then solomon said o lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a living place but your living place was not seen by men
 so i have made for you a living place a house in which you may be for ever present
 then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of israel and they were all on their feet together
 and he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who himself gave his word to my father david and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
 from the day when i took my people out of the land of egypt no town in all the tribes of israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting place of my name and i took no man to be a ruler over my people israel
 but now i have made selection of jerusalem that my name might be there and of david to be over my people israel
 now it was in the heart of my father david to put up a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 but the lord said to david my father you did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
 but you yourself will not be the builder of the house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
 and the lord has kept his word for i have taken my father davids place on the seat of the kingdom of israel as the lord gave his word and i have made the house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 and there i have put the ark in which is the agreement of the lord which he made with the people of israel
 then he took his place in front of the altar of the lord all the men of israel being present
  for solomon had made a brass stage five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had put it in the middle of the open space on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of israel stretching out his hands to heaven 
 and he said o lord the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
 for you have kept the word which you gave to your servant david my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
 so now o lord the god of israel let your word to your servant david my father come true when you said you will never be without a man to take his place before me on the seat of the kingdom of israel if only your children give attention to their ways walking in my law as you have done before me
 so now o lord the god of israel make your word come true which you said to your servant david
 but is it truly possible that god may be housed with men on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting place how much less this house which i have made
 still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace o lord my god and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you
 that your eyes may be open to this house day and night to this place of which you have said that you would put your name there to give ear to the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
 and give ear to the prayers of your servant and of your people israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear from heaven your living place and hearing have mercy
