 for six years put seed into your fields and get in the increase
 but in the seventh year let the land have a rest and be unplanted so that the poor may have food from it and let the beasts of the field take the rest do the same with your vine gardens and your olive trees
 for six days do your work and on the seventh day keep the sabbath so that your ox and your ass may have rest together with the son of your servant and the man from a strange land living among you
 take note of all these things which i have said to you and let not the names of other gods come into your minds or from your lips
 three times in the year you are to keep a feast to me
 you are to keep the feast of unleavened bread for seven days let your bread be without leaven as i gave you orders at the regular time in the month abib  for in it you came out of egypt  and let no one come before me without an offering
 and the feast of the grain cutting the first fruits of your planted fields and the feast at the start of the year when you have got in all the fruit from your fields
 three times in the year let all your males come before the lord god
 do not give the blood of my offering with leavened bread and do not let the fat of my feast be kept all night till the morning
 the best of the first fruits of your land are to be taken into the house of the lord your god the young goat is not to be cooked in its mothers milk
 see i am sending an angel before you to keep you on your way and to be your guide into the place which i have made ready for you
 give attention to him and give ear to his voice do not go against him for your wrongdoing will not be overlooked by him because my name is in him
 but if you truly give ear to his voice and do whatever i say then i will be against those who are against you fighting those who are fighting you
 and my angel will go before you guiding you into the land of the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the canaanite and the hivite and the jebusite and they will be cut off by my hand
 do not go down on your faces and give worship to their gods or do as they do but overcome them completely and let their pillars be broken down
 and give worship to the lord your god who will send his blessing on your bread and on your water and i will take all disease away from among you
 all your animals will give birth without loss not one will be without young in all your land i will give you a full measure of life
 i will send my fear before you putting to flight all the people to whom you come all those who are against you will go in flight turning their backs before you
 i will send hornets before you driving out the hivite and the canaanite and the hittite before your face
 i will not send them all out in one year for fear that their land may become waste and the beasts of the field be increased overmuch against you
 little by little i will send them away before you till your numbers are increased and you take up your heritage in the land
 i will let the limits of your land be from the red sea to the sea of the philistines and from the waste land to the river euphrates for i will give the people of those lands into your power and you will send them out before you
 make no agreement with them or with their gods
 let them not go on living in your land or they will make you do evil against me for if you give worship to their gods it will certainly be a cause of sin to you
 and he said to moses come up to the lord you and aaron and nadab and abihu and seventy of the chiefs of israel and give me worship from a distance
 and moses only may come near to the lord but the others are not to come near and the people may not come up with them
 then moses came and put before the people all the words of the lord and his laws and all the people answering with one voice said whatever the lord has said we will do
 then moses put down in writing all the words of the lord and he got up early in the morning and made an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of israel
 and he sent some of the young men of the children of israel to make burned offerings and peace offerings of oxen to the lord
 and moses took half the blood and put it in basins draining out half of the blood over the altar
