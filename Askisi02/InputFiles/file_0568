 my eye will not have mercy on you and i will have no pity but i will send the punishment of your ways on you and your disgusting works will be among you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said an evil even one evil see it is coming
 an end has come the end has come see it is coming on you
 the crowning time has come on you o people of the land the time has come the day is near the day will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
 now in a little time i will let loose my passion on you and give full effect to my wrath against you judging you for your ways and sending punishment on you for all your disgusting works
 my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity i will send on you the punishment of your ways and your disgusting works will be among you and you will see that i am the lord who gives punishment
 see the day see it is coming the crowning time has gone out the twisted way is flowering pride has put out buds
 violent behaviour has been lifted up into a rod of evil it will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
 the time has come the day is near let not him who gives a price for goods be glad or him who gets the price have sorrow
 for the trader will not go back to the things for which he had his price even while he is still living
 and he who has given a price for goods will not get them for my wrath is on all of them
 outside is the sword and inside disease and need of food he who is in the open country will be put to the sword he who is in the town will come to his end through need of food and disease
 and those of them who get away safely will go and be in the secret places like the doves of the valleys all of them will come to death every one in his sin
 all hands will be feeble and all knees without strength like water
 and they will put haircloth round them and deep fear will be covering them and shame will be on all faces and the hair gone from all their heads
 they will put out their silver into the streets and their gold will be as an unclean thing their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the wrath of the lord they will not get their desire or have food for their need because it has been the cause of their falling into sin
 as for their beautiful ornament they had put it on high and had made the images of their disgusting and hated things in it for this cause i have made it an unclean thing to them
 and i will give it into the hands of men from strange lands who will take it by force and to the evil doers of the earth to have for themselves and they will make it unholy
 and my face will be turned away from them and they will make my secret place unholy violent men will go into it and make it unholy
 make the chain for the land is full of crimes of blood and the town is full of violent acts
 for this reason i will send the worst of the nations and they will take their houses for themselves i will make the pride of their strength come to an end and their holy places will be made unclean
 shaking fear is coming and they will be looking for peace and there will be no peace
 destruction will come on destruction and one story after another and the vision of the prophet will be shamed and knowledge of the law will come to an end among the priests and wisdom among the old
 the king will give himself up to sorrow and the ruler will be clothed with wonder and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled i will give them punishment for their ways judging them as it is right for them to be judged and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month when i was in my house and the responsible men of judah were seated before me the hand of the lord came on me there
 and looking i saw a form like fire from the middle of his body and down there was fire and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining like electrum
 and he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head and the wind lifting me up between the earth and the heaven took me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the way into the inner door facing to the north where was the seat of the image of envy
 and i saw the glory of the lord there as in the vision which i saw in the valley
 then he said to me son of man now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north and on looking in the direction of the north to the north of the doorway of the altar i saw this image of envy by the way in
 and he said to me son of man do you see what they are doing even the very disgusting things which the children of israel are doing here causing me to go far away from my holy place but you will see other most disgusting things
