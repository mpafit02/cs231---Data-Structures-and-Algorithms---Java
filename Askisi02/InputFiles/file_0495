 for he said the lord has taken his oath that there will be war with amalek from generation to generation
 now news came to jethro the priest of midian moses father in law of all god had done for moses and for israel his people and how the lord had taken israel out of egypt
 and jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her away
 and her two sons one of whom was named gershom for he said i have been living in a strange land
 and the name of the other was eliezer for he said the god of my father was my help and kept me safe from the sword of pharaoh
 and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife to where moses had put up his tent in the waste land by the mountain of god
 and he said to moses i your father in law have come to you with your wife and your two sons
 and moses went out to his father in law and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss and they said to one another are you well and they came into the tent
 and moses gave his father in law an account of all the lord had done to pharaoh and to the egyptians because of israel and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way and how the lord had given them salvation
 and jethro was glad because the lord had been good to israel freeing them from the power of the egyptians
 and jethro said praise be to the lord who has taken you out of the hand of pharaoh and out of the hand of the egyptians freeing the people from the yoke of the egyptians
 now i am certain that the lord is greater than all gods for he has overcome them in their pride
 then jethro moses father in law made a burned offering to god and aaron came with the chiefs of israel and had a meal with moses father in law before god
 now on the day after moses took his seat to give decisions for the people and the people were waiting before moses from morning till evening
 and when moses father in law saw all he was doing he said what is this you are doing for the people why are you seated here by yourself with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening
 and moses said to his father in law because the people come to me to get directions from god
 and if they have any question between themselves they come to me and i am judge between a man and his neighbour and i give them the orders and laws of god
 and moses father in law said to him what you are doing is not good
 your strength and that of the people will be completely used up this work is more than you are able to do by yourself
 give ear now to my suggestion and may god be with you you are to be the peoples representative before god taking their causes to him
 teaching them his rules and his laws guiding them in the way they have to go and making clear to them the work they have to do
 but for the rest take from among the people able men such as have the fear of god true men hating profits wrongly made and put such men over them to be captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
 and let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times and let them put before you all important questions but in small things let them give decisions themselves in this way it will be less hard for you and they will take the weight off you
 if you do this and god gives approval then you will be able to go on without weariness and all this people will go to their tents in peace
 so moses took note of the words of his father in law and did as he had said
 and he made selection of able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
 and they were judges in the causes of the people at all times the hard questions they put before moses but on every small point they gave decisions themselves
 and moses let his father in law go away and he went back to his land
 in the third month after the children of israel went out from egypt on the same day they came into the waste land of sinai
 and when they had gone away from rephidim and had come into the waste land of sinai they put up their tents in the waste land before the mountain there israel put up its tents
