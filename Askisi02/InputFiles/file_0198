 he who gives honour to you gives honour to me and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me
 he who gives honour to a prophet in the name of a prophet will be given a prophets reward and he who gives honour to an upright man in the name of an upright man will be given an upright mans reward
 and whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple truly i say to you he will not go without his reward
 and it came about that when jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples he went away from there teaching and preaching in their towns
 now when john had news in prison of the works of the christ he sent his disciples
 to say to him are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 and jesus answering said to them go and give news to john of the things which you are seeing and hearing
 the blind see those who were not able to are walking lepers are made clean those who were without hearing now have their ears open the dead come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
 and a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
 and when they were going away jesus talking of john said to all the people what went you out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
 but what went you out to see a man delicately clothed those who have fair robes are in kings houses
 but why did you go out to see a prophet yes i say to you and more than a prophet
 this is he of whom it has been said see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
 truly i say to you among the sons of women there has not been a greater than john the baptist but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
 and from the days of john the baptist till now the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in and men of force take it
 for all the prophets and the law were in force till john
 and if you are able to see it this is elijah who was to come
 he who has ears let him give ear
 but what comparison may i make of this generation it is like children seated in the market places crying out to one another
 we made music for you and you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief
 for john came taking no food or drink and they say he has an evil spirit
 the son of man has come feasting and they say see a lover of food and wine a friend of tax farmers and sinners  and wisdom is judged to be right by her works
 then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done because they had not been turned from their sins
 unhappy are you chorazin  unhappy are you beth saida  for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads
 but i say to you it will be better for tyre and sidon in the day of judging than for you
 and you capernaum were you not to be lifted up to heaven you will go down into hell for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in sodom it would have been here to this day
 but i say to you that it will be better for the land of sodom in the day of judging than for you
 at that time jesus made answer and said i give praise to you o father lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children
 yes father for so it was pleasing in your eyes
 all things have been given to me by my father and no one has knowledge of the son but the father and no one has knowledge of the father but the son and he to whom the son will make it clear
