 the lord who has taken up your cause the holy one of israel says because of you i have sent to babylon and made all their seers come south and the chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships
 i am the lord your holy one the maker of israel your king
 this is the word of the lord who makes a way in the sea and a road through the deep waters
 who sends out the war carriages and the horses the army with all its force they have come down they will not get up again like a feebly burning light they are put out
 give no thought to the things which are past let the early times go out of your minds
 see i am doing a new thing now it is starting will you not take note of it i will even make a way in the waste land and rivers in the dry country
 the beasts of the field will give me honour the jackals and the ostriches because i send out waters in the waste land and rivers in the dry country to give drink to the people whom i have taken for myself
 even the people whom i made to be the witnesses of my praise
 but you have made no prayer to me o jacob and you have given no thought to me o israel
 you have not made me burned offerings of sheep or given me honour with your offerings of beasts i did not make you servants to give me an offering and i did not make you tired with requests for perfumes
 you have not got me sweet smelling plants with your money or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings but you have made me a servant to your sins and you have made me tired with your evil doings
 i even i am he who takes away your sins and i will no longer keep your evil doings in mind
 put me in mind of this let us take up the cause between us put forward your cause so that you may be seen to be in the right
 your first father was a sinner and your guides have gone against my word
 your chiefs have made my holy place unclean so i have made jacob a curse and israel a thing of shame
 and now give ear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have taken for myself
 the lord who made you forming you in your mothers body the lord your helper says have no fear o jacob my servant and you jeshurun whom i have taken for myself
 for i will send water on the land needing it and streams on the dry earth i will let my spirit come down on your seed and my blessing on your offspring
 and they will come up like grass in a well watered field like water plants by the streams
 one will say i am the lords and another will give himself the name jacob another will put a mark on his hand i am the lords and another will take the name of israel for himself
 the lord the king of israel even the lord of armies who has taken up his cause says i am the first and the last and there is no god but me
 if there is one like me let him come forward and say it let him make it clear and put it in order before me who has made clear in the past the things to come let him make clear the future to me
 have no fear be strong in heart have i not made it clear to you in the past and let you see it and you are my witnesses is there any god but me or a rock of whom i have no knowledge
 those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them and their servants see not and have no knowledge so they will be put to shame
 whoever makes a god makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit
 truly all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame and their words of power are only words of men let them all come forward together they will all be in fear and be put to shame
 the iron worker is heating the metal in the fire giving it form with his hammers and working on it with his strong arm then for need of food his strength gives way and for need of water he becomes feeble
 the woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line marking it out with his pencil after smoothing it with his plane and making circles on it with his instrument he gives it the form and glory of a man so that it may be placed in the house
 he has cedars cut down for himself he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood he has an ash tree planted and the rain gives it growth
 then it will be used to make a fire so that a man may get warm he has the oven heated with it and makes bread he makes a god with it to which he gives worship he makes a pictured image out of it and goes down on his face before it
