 what is a man profited by all his work which he does under the sun
 one generation goes and another comes but the earth is for ever
 the sun comes up and the sun goes down and goes quickly back to the place where he came up
 the wind goes to the south turning back again to the north circling round for ever
 all the rivers go down to the sea but the sea is not full to the place where the rivers go there they go again
 all things are full of weariness man may not give their story the eye has never enough of its seeing or the ear of its hearing
 that which has been is that which is to be and that which has been done is that which will be done and there is no new thing under the sun
 is there anything of which men say see this is new it has been in the old time which was before us
 there is no memory of those who have gone before and of those who come after there will be no memory for those who are still to come after them
 i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem
 and i gave my heart to searching out in wisdom all things which are done under heaven it is a hard thing which god has put on the sons of men to do
 i have seen all the works which are done under the sun all is to no purpose and desire for wind
 that which is bent may not be made straight and that which is not there may not be numbered
 i said to my heart see i have become great and am increased in wisdom more than any who were before me in jerusalem  yes my heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge
 and i gave my heart to getting knowledge of wisdom and of the ways of the foolish and i saw that this again was desire for wind
 because in much wisdom is much grief and increase of knowledge is increase of sorrow
 dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish
 the heart of the wise man goes in the right direction but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong
 and when the foolish man is walking in the way he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish
 if the wrath of the ruler is against you keep in your place in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked
 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun like an error which comes by chance from a ruler
 the foolish are placed in high positions but men of wealth are kept low
 i have seen servants on horses and rulers walking on the earth as servants
 he who makes a hole for others will himself go into it and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment
 he who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them and in the cutting of wood there is danger
 if the iron has no edge and he does not make it sharp then he has to put out more strength but wisdom makes things go well
 if a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said then there is no longer any use in the word of power
 the words of a wise mans mouth are sweet to all but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction
 the first words of his mouth are foolish and the end of his talk is evil crime
 the foolish are full of words man has no knowledge of what will be and who is able to say what will be after him
