 and the pillars of the open space round it with their bases and nails and cords
 and those whose tents are to be placed on the east side of the house in front of the tent of meeting looking to the dawn are moses and aaron and his sons who will do the work of the holy place for the children of israel and any strange person who comes near will be put to death
 all the levites numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord all the males of one month old and over numbered in the order of their families were twenty two thousand
 and the lord said to moses let all the first male children be numbered and take the number of their names
 and give to me the levites  i am the lord  in place of the first sons of the children of israel and the cattle of the levites in place of the first births among the cattle of the children of israel
 so moses had all the first sons among the children of israel numbered as the lord said to him
 every first son from a month old and over was numbered by name and the number came to twenty two thousand two hundred and seventy three
 and the lord said to moses
 take the levites in place of all the first sons of the children of israel and the cattle of the levites in place of their cattle the levites are to be mine i am the lord
 and the price you have to give for the two hundred and seventy three first sons of the children of israel which are in addition to the number of the levites
 will be five shekels for every one by the scale of the holy place  the shekel is twenty gerahs 
 and this money the price of those over the number of the levites is to be given to aaron and his sons
 so moses took the money the price of those whose place had not been taken by the levites
 from the first sons of israel he took it a thousand three hundred and sixty five shekels by the scale of the holy place
 and he gave the money to aaron and his sons as the lord had said
 and moses said to the heads of the tribes of the children of israel this is the order of the lord
 when a man takes an oath to the lord or gives an undertaking having the force of an oath let him not go back from his word but let him do whatever he has said he will do
 if a woman being young and under the authority of her father takes an oath to the lord or gives an undertaking
 if her father hearing of her oath or the undertaking she has given says nothing to her then all her oaths and every undertaking she has given will have force
 but if her father hearing of it makes her take back her word then the oaths or the undertakings she has given will have no force and she will have forgiveness from the lord because her oath was broken by her father
 and if she is married to a husband at the time when she is under an oath or an undertaking given without thought
 if her husband hearing of it says nothing to her at the time then the oaths she made and the undertakings she gave will have force
 but if her husband hearing of it makes her take it back then the oath she made and the undertaking she gave without thought will have no force or effect and she will have the lords forgiveness
 but an oath made by a widow or one who is no longer married to her husband and every undertaking she has given will have force
 if she made an oath while she was under the authority of her husband
 and her husband hearing of it said nothing to her and did not put a stop to it then all her oaths and every undertaking she gave will have force
 but if her husband on hearing of it made them without force or effect then whatever she has said about her oaths or her undertaking has no force her husband has made them without effect and she will have the lords forgiveness
 every oath and every undertaking which she gives to keep herself from pleasure may be supported or broken by her husband
 but if the days go on and her husband says nothing whatever to her then he is giving the support of his authority to her oaths and undertakings because at the time of hearing them he said nothing to her
 but if at some time after hearing of them he makes them without force then he is responsible for her wrongdoing
