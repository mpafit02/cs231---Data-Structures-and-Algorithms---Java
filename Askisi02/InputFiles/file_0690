 if in that very minute it does evil in my eyes going against my orders then my good purpose which i said i would do for them will be changed
 now then say to the men of judah and to the people of jerusalem this is what the lord has said see i am forming an evil thing against you and designing a design against you let every man come back now from his evil way and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better
 but they will say there is no hope we will go on in our designs and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do
 so this is what the lord has said make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things the virgin of israel has done a very shocking thing
 will the white snow go away from the top of sirion will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry
 for my people have put me out of their memory burning perfumes to that which is nothing and because of this i will put a cause of falling in their ways even in the old roads and will make them go on side roads in a way not lifted up
 making their land a thing of wonder causing sounds of surprise for ever everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder shaking his head
 i will send them in flight as from an east wind before the attacker i will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall
 then they said come let us make a design against jeremiah for teaching will never be cut off from the priest or wisdom from the wise or the word from the prophet come let us make use of his words for an attack on him and let us give attention with care to what he says
 give thought to me o lord and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me
 is evil to be the reward of good for they have made a deep hole for my soul keep in mind how i took my place before you to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them
 for this cause let their children be without food and give them over to the power of the sword and let their wives be without children and become widows let their men be overtaken by death and their young men be put to the sword in the fight
 let a cry for help go up from their houses when you send an armed band on them suddenly for they have made a hole in which to take me and have put nets for my feet secretly
 but you lord have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life let not their evil doing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes but let it be a cause of falling before you so do to them in the time of your wrath
 this is what the lord has said go and get for money a potters bottle made of earth and take with you some of the responsible men of the people and of the priests
 and go out to the valley of the son of hinnom by the way into the door of broken pots and there say in a loud voice the words which i will give you
 say give ear to the word of the lord o kings of judah and people of jerusalem the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send evil on this place which will be bitter to the ears of anyone hearing of it
 because they have given me up and made this place a strange place burning perfumes in it to other gods of whom they and their fathers and the kings of judah had no knowledge and they have made this place full of the blood of those who have done no wrong
 and they have put up the high places of the baal burning their sons in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and it was never in my mind
 for this cause see a time is coming says the lord when this place will no longer be named topheth or the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of death
 i will make the purpose of judah and jerusalem come to nothing in this place i will have them put to the sword by their haters and by the hands of those who have designs on their life and their dead bodies i will give to be food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
 and i will make this town a thing of wonder and a cause of surprise everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of surprise because of all its troubles
 i will make them take the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters for food they will be making a meal of one another because of their bitter need and the cruel grip of their haters and those who have made designs against their life
 then let the potters bottle be broken before the eyes of the men who have gone with you
 and say to them this is what the lord of armies has said even so will this people and this town be broken by me as a potters bottle is broken and may not be put together again and the bodies of the dead will be put in the earth in topheth till there is no more room
 this is what i will do to this place says the lord and to its people making this town like topheth
 and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah which they have made unclean will be like the place of topheth even all the houses on whose roofs perfumes have been burned to all the army of heaven and drink offerings drained out to other gods
 then jeremiah came from topheth where the lord had sent him to give the prophets word and he took his place in the open square of the lords house and said to all the people
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send on this town and on all her towns all the evil which i have said because they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear to my words
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
