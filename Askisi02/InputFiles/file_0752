 but god will not give ear to what is false or the ruler of all take note of it
 how much less when you say that you do not see him that the cause is before him and you are waiting for him
 and now  
 and jobs mouth is open wide to give out what is of no profit increasing words without knowledge
 and elihu went on to say
 give me a little more time and i will make it clear to you for i have still something to say for god
 i will get my knowledge from far and i will give righteousness to my maker
 for truly my words are not false one who has all knowledge is talking with you
 truly god gives up the hard hearted and will not give life to the sinner
 his eyes are ever on the upright and he gives to the crushed their right
 lifting them up to the seat of kings and making them safe for ever
 and if they have been prisoned in chains and taken in cords of trouble
 then he makes clear to them what they have done even their evil works in which they have taken pride
 their ear is open to his teaching and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil
 if they give ear to his voice and do his word then he gives them long life and years full of pleasure
 but if not they come to their end and give up their breath without knowledge
 those who have no fear of god keep wrath stored up in their hearts they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners
 they come to their end while they are still young their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods
 he makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation opening their ears by their trouble
 
 
 
 
 
 take care not to be turned to sin for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow
 truly god is lifted up in strength who is a ruler like him
 who ever gave orders to him or said to him you have done wrong
 see that you give praise to his work about which men make songs
 all people are looking on it man sees it from far
 truly god is great greater than all our knowledge the number of his years may not be searched out
