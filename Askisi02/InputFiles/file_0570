 even these cyrus made mithredath the keeper of his wealth get out and he gave them after numbering them to sheshbazzar the ruler of judah
 and this is the number of them there were thirty gold plates a thousand silver plates twenty nine knives
 thirty gold basins four hundred and ten silver basins and a thousand other vessels
 there were five thousand four hundred gold and silver vessels all these were taken back by sheshbazzar when those who had been taken prisoner went up from babylon to jerusalem
 now while ezra was making his prayer and his statement of wrongdoing weeping and falling down before the house of god a very great number of men and women and children out of israel came together round him for the people were weeping bitterly
 and shecaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answering said to ezra we have done evil against our god and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the land but still there is hope for israel in this question
 let us now make an agreement with our god to put away all the wives and all their children if it seems right to my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our god and let it be done in keeping with the law
 up now  for this is your business and we are with you take heart and do it
 then ezra got up and made the chiefs of the priests and the levites and all israel take an oath that they would do this so they took an oath
 then ezra got up from before the house of god and went into the room of jehohanan the son of eliashib but when he came there he took no food or drink for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back
 and they made a public statement through all judah and jerusalem to all those who had come back that they were to come together to jerusalem
 and that if anyone did not come before three days were past as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men all his goods would be put under the curse and he himself would be cut off from the meeting of the people who had come back
 then all the men of judah and benjamin came together to jerusalem before three days were past it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of god shaking with fear because of this business and because of the great rain
 and ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them you have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives so increasing the sin of israel
 so now give praise to the lord the god of your fathers and do his pleasure and make yourselves separate from the peoples of the land and from the strange women
 then all the people answering said with a loud voice as you have said so it is right for us to do
 but the number of people is great and it is a time of much rain it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even two for our sin in this business is great
 so now let our rulers be representatives for all the people and let all those in our towns who are married to strange women come at fixed times and with them the responsible men and the judges of every town till the burning wrath of our god is turned away from us and this has been done
 only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah were against this meshullam and shabbethai the levite supporting them
 so those who had come back did so and ezra the priest with certain heads of families by their fathers families all of them by their names were marked out and on the first day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question with care
 and they got to the end of all the men who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month
 and among the sons of the priests who were married to strange women were these of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brothers maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah
 and they gave their word that they would put away their wives and for their sin they gave an offering of a male sheep of the flock
 and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah
 and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah
 and of the sons of pashhur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethanel jozabad and elasah
 and of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah  that is kelita  pethahiah judah and eliezer
 and of the music makers eliashib and of the door keepers shallum and telem and uri
 and of israel the sons of parosh ramiah and izziah and malchijah and mijamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah
 and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and elijah
