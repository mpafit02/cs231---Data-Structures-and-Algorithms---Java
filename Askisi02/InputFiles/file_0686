 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 the lord has said in this way i will do damage to the pride of judah and to the great pride of jerusalem
 these evil people who say they will not give ear to my words who go on in the pride of their hearts and have become servants and worshippers of other gods will become like this band which is of no use for anything
 for as a band goes tightly round a mans body so i made all the people of israel and all the people of judah tightly united to me so that they might be a people for me and a name and a praise and a glory but they would not give ear
 so you are to say this word to them this is the word of the lord the god of israel every skin bottle will be full of wine and they will say to you is it not quite clear to us that every skin bottle will be full of wine
 then you are to say to them the lord has said i will make all the people of this land even the kings seated on davids seat and the priests and the prophets and all the people of jerusalem overcome with strong drink
 i will have them smashed against one another fathers and sons together says the lord i will have no pity or mercy i will have no feeling for them to keep me from giving them to destruction
 give ear and let your ears be open be not lifted up for these are the words of the lord
 give glory to the lord your god before he makes it dark and before your feet are slipping on the dark mountains and while you are looking for a light he makes it into deep dark into black night
 but if you do not give ear to it my soul will be weeping in secret for your pride my eye will be weeping bitterly streaming with water because the lords flock has been taken away as prisoners
 say to the king and to the queen mother make yourselves low be seated on the earth for the crown of your glory has come down from your heads
 the towns of the south are shut up and there is no one to make them open judah is taken away as prisoners all judah is taken away as prisoners
 let your eyes be lifted up  o jerusalem  and see those who are coming from the north where is the flock which was given to you your beautiful flock
 what will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth
 and if you say in your heart why have these things come on me because of the number of your sins your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you
 is it possible for the skin of the ethiopian to be changed or the markings on the leopard then it might be possible for you to do good who have been trained to do evil
 so i will send them in all directions as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land
 this is your fate the part measured out to you by me says the lord because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false
 so i will have your skirts uncovered before your face in order that your shame may be seen
 i have seen your disgusting acts even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field unhappy are you o jerusalem you have no desire to be made clean how long will you be in turning back to me
 the word of the lord came to jeremiah when there was no water
 judah is weeping and its doors are dark with sorrow and people are seated on the earth clothed in black and the cry of jerusalem has gone up
 their great men have sent their servants for water they come to the holes and there is no water to be seen they come back with nothing in their vessels they are overcome with shame and fear covering their heads
 those who do work on the land are in fear for there has been no rain on the land and the farmers are shamed covering their heads
 and the roe giving birth in the field lets her young one be uncared for because there is no grass
 and the asses of the field on the open hilltops are opening their mouths wide like jackals to get air their eyes are hollow because there is no grass
 though our sins give witness against us do something o lord for the honour of your name for again and again we have been turned away from you we have done evil against you
 o you hope of israel its saviour in time of trouble why are you like one who is strange in the land and like a traveller putting up his tent for a night
 why are you like a man surprised like a man of war who is not able to give help but you o lord are with us and we are named by your name do not go away from us
 this is what the lord has said about this people even so they have been glad to go from the right way they have not kept their feet from wandering so the lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep their wrongdoing in mind and send punishment for their sins
