 and this one was still talking when another came and said your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brothers house
 when a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house and it came down on the young men and they are dead and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 then job got up and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair he went down on his face to the earth and gave worship and said
 with nothing i came out of my mothers body and with nothing i will go back there the lord gave and the lord has taken away let the lords name be praised
 in all this job did no sin and did not say that gods acts were foolish
 my soul is tired of life i will let my sad thoughts go free in words my soul will make a bitter outcry
 i will say to god do not put me down as a sinner make clear to me what you have against me
 what profit is it to you to be cruel to give up the work of your hands looking kindly on the design of evil doers
 have you eyes of flesh or do you see as man sees
 are your days as the days of man or your years like his
 that you take note of my sin searching after my wrongdoing
 though you see that i am not an evil doer and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands
 your hands made me and i was formed by you but then changing your purpose you gave me up to destruction
 o keep in mind that you made me out of earth and will you send me back again to dust
 was i not drained out like milk becoming hard like cheese
 by you i was clothed with skin and flesh and joined together with bones and muscles
 you have been kind to me and your grace has been with me and your care has kept my spirit safe
 but you kept these things in the secret of your heart i am certain this was in your thoughts
 that if i did wrong you would take note of it and would not make me clear from sin
 that if i was an evil doer the curse would come on me and if i was upright my head would not be lifted up being full of shame and overcome with trouble
 and that if there was cause for pride you would go after me like a lion and again put out your wonders against me
 that you would send new witnesses against me increasing your wrath against me and letting loose new armies on me
 why then did you make me come out of my mothers body it would have been better for me to have taken my last breath and for no eye to have seen me
 and for me to have been as if i had not been to have been taken from my mothers body straight to my last resting place
 are not the days of my life small in number let your eyes be turned away from me so that i may have a little pleasure
 before i go to the place from which i will not come back to the land where all is dark and black
 a land of thick dark without order where the very light is dark
 then zophar the naamathite made answer and said
 are all these words to go unanswered and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk
 are your words of pride to make men keep quiet and are you to make sport with no one to put you to shame
