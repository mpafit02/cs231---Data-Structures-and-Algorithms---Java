 and love of the brothers to fear of god and to love of the brothers love itself
 for if you have these things in good measure they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
 for the man who has not these things is blind seeing only what is near having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins
 for this reason my brothers take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain for if you do these things you will never have a fall
 for so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
 for this reason i will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith
 and it seems right to me as long as i am in this tent of flesh to keep your minds awake by working on your memory
 for i am conscious that in a short time i will have to put off this tent of flesh as our lord jesus christ has made clear to me
 and i will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death
 for when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ our teaching was not based on stories put together by art but we were eye witnesses of his glory
 for god the father gave him honour and glory when such a voice came to him out of the great glory saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and this voice came from heaven even to our ears when we were with him on the holy mountain
 and so the words of the prophets are made more certain and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts
 being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets
 for these words did not ever come through the impulse of men but the prophets had them from god being moved by the holy spirit
 but there were false prophets among the people as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction even turning away from the lord who gave himself for them whose destruction will come quickly and they themselves will be the cause of it
 and a great number will go with them in their evil ways through whom the true way will have a bad name
 and in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit like traders doing business in souls whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them
 for if god did not have pity for the angels who did evil but sent them down into hell to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged
 and did not have mercy on the world which then was but only kept safe noah a preacher of righteousness with seven others when he let loose the waters over the world of the evil doers
 and sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him
 and kept safe lot the upright man who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evil doers
  because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes 
 the lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing and to keep evil doers under punishment till the day of judging
 but specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh and make sport of authority ready to take chances uncontrolled they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places
 though the angels who are greater in strength and power do not make use of violent language against them before the lord
 but these men like beasts without reason whose natural use is to be taken and put to death crying out against things of which they have no knowledge will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others
 for the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil doing such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime they are like the marks of a disease like poisoned wounds among you feasting together with you in joy
 having eyes full of evil desire never having enough of sin turning feeble souls out of the true way they are children of cursing whose hearts are well used to bitter envy
 turning out of the true way they have gone wandering in error after the way of balaam the son of beor who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing
