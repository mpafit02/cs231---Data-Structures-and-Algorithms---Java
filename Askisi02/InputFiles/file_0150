 and he came down quickly and took him into his house with joy
 and when they saw it they were all angry saying he has gone into the house of a sinner
 and zacchaeus waiting before him said to the lord see lord half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from anyone wrongly i give him back four times as much
 and jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house for even he is a son of abraham
 for the son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way and to be their saviour
 and while they were giving ear to these words he made another story for them because he was near jerusalem and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of god was coming straight away
 so he said a certain man of high birth went into a far away country to get a kingdom for himself and to come back
 and he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them do business with this till i come
 but his people had no love for him and sent representatives after him saying we will not have this man for our ruler
 and when he came back again having got his kingdom he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him so that he might have an account of what business they had done
 and the first came before him saying lord your pound has made ten pounds
 and he said to him you have done well o good servant because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns
 and another came saying your pound has made five pounds
 and he said you will be ruler over five towns
 and another came saying lord here is your pound which i put away in a cloth
 because i was in fear of you for you are a hard man you take up what you have not put down and get in grain where you have not put seed
 he said to him by the words of your mouth you will be judged you bad servant you had knowledge that i am a hard man taking up what i have not put down and getting in grain where i have not put seed
 why then did you not put my money in a bank so that when i came i would get it back with interest
 and he said to the others who were near take the pound away from him and give it to the man who has ten
 and they say to him lord he has ten pounds
 and i say to you that to everyone who has more will be given but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 and as for those who were against me who would not have me for their ruler let them come here and be put to death before me
 and when he had said this he went on in front of them going up to jerusalem
 and it came about that when he got near beth phage and bethany by the mountain which is named the mountain of olives he sent two of the disciples
 saying go into the little town in front of you and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and take him
 and if anyone says to you why are you taking him say the lord has need of him
 and those whom he sent went away and it was as he said
 and when they were getting the young ass the owners of it said to them why are you taking the young ass
 and they said the lord has need of him
 and they took him to jesus and they put their clothing on the ass and jesus got on to him
