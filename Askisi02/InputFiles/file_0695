 am i only a god who is near says the lord and not a god at a distance
 in what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him says the lord is there any place in heaven or earth where i am not says the lord
 my ears have been open to what the prophets have said who say false words in my name saying i have had a dream i have had a dream i have had a dream
 is  my word  in the hearts of the prophets who give out false words even the prophets of the deceit of their hearts
 whose purpose is to take away the memory of my name from my people by their dreams of which every man is talking to his neighbour as their fathers gave up the memory of my name for the baal
 if a prophet has a dream let him give out his dream and he who has my word let him give out my word in good faith what has the dry stem to do with the grain says the lord
 is not my word like fire says the lord and like a hammer smashing the rock to bits
 for this cause i am against the prophets says the lord who take my words every one from his neighbour
 see i am against the prophets says the lord who let their tongues say he has said
 see i am against the prophets of false dreams says the lord who give them out and make my people go out of the way by their deceit and their uncontrolled words but i did not send them or give them orders and they will be of no profit to this people says the lord
 and if this people or the prophet or a priest questioning you says what word of weight is there from the lord then you are to say to them you are the word for i will not be troubled with you any more says the lord
 and as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say a word of weight from the lord  i will send punishment on that man and on his house
 but this is what you are to say every man to his neighbour and every man to his brother what answer has the lord given and what has the lord said
 and you will no longer put people in mind of the word of weight of the lord for every mans word will be a weight on himself for the words of the living god of the lord of armies our god have been twisted by you
 this is what you are to say to the prophet what answer has the lord given to you and what has the lord said
 but if you say the word of weight of the lord this is what the lord has said because you say the weight of the lord and i have sent to you saying you are not to say the weight of the lord
 for this reason truly i will put you completely out of my memory and i will put you and the town which i gave to you and to your fathers away from before my face
 and i will give you a name without honour for ever and unending shame which will never go from the memory of men
 the lord gave me a vision and i saw two baskets full of figs put in front of the temple of the lord after nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had taken prisoner jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the chiefs of judah and the expert workmen and metal workers from jerusalem and had taken them to babylon
 one basket had very good figs like the figs which first come to growth and the other basket had very bad figs so bad that they were of no use for food
 then the lord said to me what do you see jeremiah and i said figs the good figs are very good and the bad very bad and of no use for food they are so bad
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 this is what the lord the god of israel has said like these good figs so in my eyes will be the prisoners of judah whom i have sent from this place into the land of the chaldaeans for their good
 for i will keep my eyes on them for good and i will take them back again to this land building them up and not pulling them down planting them and not uprooting them
 and i will give them a heart to have knowledge of me that i am the lord and they will be my people and i will be their god for they will come back to me with all their heart
 and like the bad figs which are so bad that they are of no use for food so i will give up zedekiah king of judah and his chiefs and the rest of jerusalem who are still in this land and those who are in the land of egypt
 i will give them up to be a cause of fear and of trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth to be a name of shame and common talk and a cutting word and a curse in all the places wherever i will send them wandering
 and i will send the sword and need of food and disease among them till they are all cut off from the land which i gave to them and to their fathers
 the word which came to jeremiah about all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah this was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 this word jeremiah gave out to all the people of judah and to those living in jerusalem saying
