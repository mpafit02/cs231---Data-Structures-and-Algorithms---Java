 so on the fourth day they said to samsons wife get from your husband the answer to his question by some trick or other or we will have you and your fathers house burned with fire did you get us here to take all we have
 then samsons wife weeping over him said truly you have no love for me but only hate you have put a hard question to the children of my people and have not given me the answer and he said to her see i have not given the answer even to my father or my mother am i to give it to you
 and all the seven days of the feast she went on weeping over him and on the seventh day he gave her the answer because she gave him no peace and she sent word of it to the children of her people
 then on the seventh day before he went into the brides room the men of the town said to him what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said to them if you had not been ploughing with my cow you would not have got the answer to my question
 and the spirit of the lord came rushing on him and he went down to ashkelon and attacking thirty men there took their clothing from them and gave it to the men who had given the answer to his hard question then full of wrath he went back to his fathers house
 but samsons wife was given to the friend who had been his best man
 now a short time after at the time of the grain cutting samson taking with him a young goat went to see his wife and he said i will go in to my wife into the brides room but her father would not let him go in
 and her father said it seemed to me that you had only hate for her so i gave her to your friend but is not her younger sister fairer than she so please take her in place of the other
 then samson said to them this time i will give payment in full to the philistines for i am going to do them great evil
 so samson went and got three hundred foxes and some sticks of fire wood and he put the foxes tail to tail with a stick between every two tails
 then firing the sticks he let the foxes loose among the uncut grain of the philistines and all the corded stems as well as the living grain and the vine gardens and the olives went up in flames
 then the philistines said who has done this and they said samson the son in law of the timnite because he took his wife and gave her to his friend so the philistines came up and had her and her fathers house burned
 and samson said to them if you go on like this truly i will take my full payment from you and that will be the end of it
 and he made an attack on them driving them in uncontrolled flight and causing great destruction then he went away to his safe place in the crack of the rock at etam
 then the philistines went and put up their tents in judah all round lehi
 and the men of judah said why have you come up against us and they said we have come up to take samson and to do to him as he has done to us
 then three thousand of the men of judah went down to the crack of the rock of etam and said to samson is it not clear to you that the philistines are our rulers what is this you have done to us and he said to them i only did to them as they did to me
 then they said to him we have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the philistines and samson said to them give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves
 and they said no we will take you and give you up into their hands but truly we will not put you to death so knotting two new cords round him they took him up from the rock
 and when he came to lehi the philistines came out meeting him with loud cries then the spirit of the lord came rushing on him and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire and the bands came falling off his hands
 and taking up the mouth bone of an ass newly dead which he saw by chance on the earth he put to death a thousand men with it
 and samson said with a red asss mouth bone i have made them red with blood with a red asss mouth bone i have sent destruction on a thousand men
 and having said these words he let the mouth bone go out of his hand so that place was named ramath lehi
 after this he was in great need of water and crying out to the lord he said you have given this great salvation by the hand of your servant and now need of water will be my death and i will be given into the hands of this people who are without circumcision
 then god made a crack in the hollow rock in lehi and water came out of it and after drinking his spirit came back to him and he was strong again so that place was named en hakkore it is in lehi to this day
 and he was judge of israel in the days of the philistines for twenty years
 now samson went to gaza and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her
 and it was said to the gazites samson is here so they went round watching for him all day at the doorway of the town but at night they kept quiet saying when daylight comes we will put him to death
 and samson was there till the middle of the night then he got up and took a grip on the doors of the town pulling them up together with their two supports and their locks and put them on his back and took them up to the top of the hill in front of hebron
 now after this he was in love with a woman in the valley of sorek named delilah
