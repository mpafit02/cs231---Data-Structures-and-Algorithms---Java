 for this reason keep it in mind that in the past you the gentiles in the flesh who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision in the flesh made by hands
 that you were at that time without christ being cut off from any part in israels rights as a nation having no part in gods agreement having no hope and without god in the world
 but now in christ jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of christ
 for he is our peace who has made the two into one and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down
 having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us even the law with its rules and orders so that he might make in himself of the two one new man so making peace
 and that the two might come into agreement with god in one body through the cross so putting an end to that division
 and he came preaching peace to you who were far off and to those who were near
 because through him the two of us are able to come near in one spirit to the father
 so then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of god but you are numbered among the saints and of the family of god
 resting on the base of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the chief keystone
 in whom all the building rightly joined together comes to be a holy house of god in the lord
 in whom you with the rest are united together as a living place of god in the spirit
 for this cause i paul the prisoner of christ jesus for you gentiles
 if that ordering of the grace of god has come to your knowledge which was given to me for you
 how by revelation the secret was made clear to me as i said before in a short letter
 by the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of christ
 which in other generations was not given to the sons of men but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit
 which is that the gentiles have a part in the heritage and in the same body and in the same hope in christ through the good news
 of which i was made a preacher through that grace of god which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power
 to me who am less than the least of all the saints was this grace given so that i might make clear to the gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of christ
 and make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in god who made all things
 so that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide shining wisdom of god
 which is seen in his eternal purpose in christ jesus our lord
 by whom we come near to god without fear through faith in him
 for this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you which are your glory
 for this cause i go down on my knees before the father
 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named
 that in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his spirit in your hearts
 so that christ may have his place in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and based in love
 may have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is
