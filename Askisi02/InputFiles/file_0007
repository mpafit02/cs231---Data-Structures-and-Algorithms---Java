 again what will they do who are given baptism for the dead if the dead do not come back at all why are people given baptism for them
 and why are we in danger every hour
 yes truly by your pride in me my brothers in christ jesus our lord my life is one long death
 if after the way of men i was fighting with beasts at ephesus what profit is it to me if the dead do not come to life again let us take our pleasure in feasting for tomorrow we come to an end
 do not be tricked by false words evil company does damage to good behaviour
 be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin for some have no knowledge of god i say this to put you to shame
 but someone will say how do the dead come back and with what sort of body do they come
 foolish man it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again
 and when you put it into the earth you do not put in the body which it will be but only the seed of grain or some other sort of plant
 but god gives it a body as it is pleasing to him and to every seed its special body
 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one flesh of men another of beasts another of birds and another of fishes
 and there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth but the glory of the one is different from that of the other
 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for the glory of one star is different from that of another
 so is it with the coming back from the dead it is planted in death it comes again in life
 it is planted in shame it comes again in glory feeble when it is planted it comes again in power
 it is planted a natural body it comes again as a body of the spirit if there is a natural body there is equally a body of the spirit
 and so it is said the first man adam was a living soul the last adam is a life giving spirit
 but that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit
 the first man is from the earth and of the earth the second man is from heaven
 those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven
 and in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven
 now i say this my brothers that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of god and death may not have a part in life
 see i am giving you the revelation of a secret we will not all come to the sleep of death but we will all be changed
 in a second in the shutting of an eye at the sound of the last horn for at that sound the dead will come again free for ever from the power of death and we will be changed
 for this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life
 but when this has taken place then that which was said in the writings will come true death is overcome by life
 o death where is your power o death where are your pains
 the pain of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
 but praise be to god who gives us strength to overcome through our lord jesus christ
 for this cause my dear brothers be strong in purpose and unmoved ever giving yourselves to the work of the lord because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the lord
