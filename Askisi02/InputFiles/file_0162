 now in the fifteenth year of the rule of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being ruler of judaea and herod being king of galilee his brother philip king of the country of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias king of abilene
 when annas and caiaphas were high priests the word of the lord came to john the son of zacharias in the waste land
 and he came into all the country round about jordan preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
 as it says in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 every valley will be lifted up and all the mountains and hills made low and the twisted will be made straight and the rough ways smooth
 and all flesh will see the salvation of god
 so he said to the people who went out to him for baptism you offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
 make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed and do not say to yourselves we have abraham for our father for i say to you that god is able from these stones to make children of abraham
 and even now the axe is put to the root of the trees and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire
 and the people put questions to him saying what have we to do
 and he made answer and said to them he who has two coats let him give to him who has not even one and he who has food let him do the same
 then tax farmers came to him for baptism and said to him master what have we to do
 and he said to them do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount
 and men of the army put questions to him saying and what have we to do and he said to them do no violent acts to any man and do not take anything without right and let your payment be enough for you
 and while the people were waiting and all men were questioning in their hearts about john if he was the christ or not
 john made answer saying to them all truly i give you baptism with water but one is coming who is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to undo he will give you baptism with the holy spirit and with fire
 in whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out
 and so comforting them with these and other words he gave the good news to the people
 but herod the king because john had made a protest on account of herodias his brothers wife and other evil things which herod had done
 did this most evil thing of all and had john shut up in prison
 now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism jesus having had baptism with them was in prayer when the heaven being open
 the holy spirit came down in the form of a dove and a voice came from heaven saying you are my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and jesus at this time was about thirty years old being the son  as it seemed  of joseph the son of heli
 the son of matthat the son of levi the son of melchi the son of jannai the son of joseph
 the son of mattathias the son of amos the son of nahum the son of esli the son of naggai
 the son of maath the son of mattathias the son of semein the son of josech the son of joda
 the son of joanan the son of rhesa the son of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel the son of neri
 the son of melchi the son of addi the son of cosam the son of elmadam the son of er
 the son of jesus the son of eliezer the son of jorim the son of matthat the son of levi
 the son of symeon the son of judas the son of joseph the son of jonam the son of eliakim
