 a man may make designs for his way but the lord is the guide of his steps
 decision is in the lips of the king his mouth will not go wrong in judging
 true measures and scales are the lords all the weights of the bag are his work
 evil doing is disgusting to kings for the seat of the ruler is based on righteousness
 lips of righteousness are the delight of kings and he who says what is upright is dear to him
 the wrath of the king is like those who give news of death but a wise man will put peace in place of it
 in the light of the kings face there is life and his approval is like a cloud of spring rain
 how much better it is to get wisdom than gold  and to get knowledge is more to be desired than silver
 the highway of the upright is to be turned away from evil he who takes care of his way will keep his soul
 pride goes before destruction and a stiff spirit before a fall
 better it is to have a gentle spirit with the poor than to take part in the rewards of war with men of pride
 he who gives attention to the law of right will get good and whoever puts his faith in the lord is happy
 the wise hearted will be named men of good sense and by pleasing words learning is increased
 wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it but the punishment of the foolish is their foolish behaviour
 the heart of the wise man is the teacher of his mouth and gives increased learning to his lips
 pleasing words are like honey sweet to the soul and new life to the bones
 there is a way which seems straight before a man but its end is the ways of death
 the desire of the working man is working for him for his need of food is driving him on
 a good for nothing man is a designer of evil and in his lips there is a burning fire
 a man of twisted purposes is a cause of fighting everywhere and he who says evil secretly makes trouble between friends
 a violent man puts desire of evil into his neighbours mind and makes him go in a way which is not good
 he whose eyes are shut is a man of twisted purposes and he who keeps his lips shut tight makes evil come about
 the grey head is a crown of glory if it is seen in the way of righteousness
 he who is slow to be angry is better than a man of war and he who has control over his spirit than he who takes a town
 a thing may be put to the decision of chance but it comes about through the lord
 better a bit of dry bread in peace than a house full of feasting and violent behaviour
 a servant who does wisely will have rule over a son causing shame and will have his part in the heritage among brothers
 the heating pot is for silver and the oven fire for gold but the lord is the tester of hearts
 a wrongdoer gives attention to evil lips and a man of deceit gives ear to a damaging tongue
 whoever makes sport of the poor puts shame on his maker and he who is glad because of trouble will not go free from punishment
