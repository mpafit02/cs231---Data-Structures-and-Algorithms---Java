 he said to them come and see they went with him then and saw where he was living and they were with him all that day it was then about the tenth hour of the day
 andrew simon peters brother was one of the two men who hearing what john said went after jesus
 early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him we have made discovery  it is the messiah   which is to say the christ 
 and he took him to jesus looking at him fixedly jesus said you are simon the son of john your name will be cephas  which is to say peter 
 the day after this jesus had a desire to go into galilee he came across philip and said to him come and be my disciple
 now philips town was beth saida where andrew and peter came from
 philip came across nathanael and said to him we have made a discovery  it is he of whom moses in the law and the prophets were writing jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
 nazareth  said nathanael is it possible for any good to come out of nazareth philip said to him come and see
 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said of him see here is a true son of israel in whom there is nothing false
 nathanael said to him where did you get knowledge of me in answer jesus said before philip was talking with you while you were still under the fig tree i saw you
 nathanael said to him rabbi you are the son of god you are king of israel 
 in answer jesus said to him you have faith because i said to you i saw you under the fig tree you will see greater things than these
 and he said to him truly i say to you all you will see heaven opening and gods angels going up and coming down on the son of man
 truly i say to you he who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept but gets in by some other way is a thief and an outlaw
 he who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep
 the porter lets him in and the sheep give ear to his voice he says over the names of the sheep and takes them out
 when he has got them all out he goes before them and the sheep go after him for they have knowledge of his voice
 they will not go after another who is not their keeper but will go from him in flight because his voice is strange to them
 in this jesus was teaching them in the form of a story but what he said was not clear to them
 so jesus said again truly i say to you i am the door of the sheep
 all who came before me are thieves and outlaws but the sheep did not give ear to them
 i am the door if any man goes in through me he will have salvation and will go in and go out and will get food
 the thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death he comes for their destruction i have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure
 i am the good keeper of sheep the good keeper gives his life for the sheep
 he who is a servant and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep sees the wolf coming and goes in flight away from the sheep and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions
 because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep
 i am the good keeper i have knowledge of my sheep and they have knowledge of me
 even as the father has knowledge of me and i of the father and i am giving my life for the sheep
 and i have other sheep which are not of this field i will be their guide in the same way and they will give ear to my voice so there will be one flock and one keeper
