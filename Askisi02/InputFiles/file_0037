 for we all have to come before christ to be judged so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body good or bad
 having in mind then the fear of the lord we put these things before men but god sees our hearts and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes
 we are not again requesting your approval but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming and not in the heart
 for if we are foolish it is to god or if we are serious it is for you
 for it is the love of christ which is moving us because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all then all have undergone death
 and that he underwent death for all so that the living might no longer be living to themselves but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead
 for this reason from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh even if we have had knowledge of christ after the flesh we have no longer any such knowledge
 so if any man is in christ he is in a new world the old things have come to an end they have truly become new
 but all things are of god who has made us at peace with himself through christ and has given to us the work of making peace
 that is that god was in christ making peace between the world and himself not putting their sins to their account and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace
 so we are the representatives of christ as if god was making a request to you through us we make our request to you in the name of christ be at peace with god
 for him who had no knowledge of sin god made to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of god in him
 we then working together with god make our request to you not to take the grace of god to no purpose
  for he says i have given ear to you at a good time and i have been your helper in a day of salvation see now is the good time now is the day of salvation 
 giving no cause for trouble in anything so that no one may be able to say anything against our work
 but in everything making it clear that we are the servants of god in quiet strength in troubles in need in sorrow
 in blows in prisons in attacks in hard work in watchings in going without food
 in a clean heart in knowledge in long waiting in being kind in the holy spirit in true love
 in the true word in the power of god with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
 by glory and by shame by an evil name and a good name as untrue and still true
 unnoted but still kept fully in mind as near to death but still living as undergoing punishment but not put to death
 as full of sorrow but ever glad as poor but giving wealth to others as having nothing but still having all things
 our mouth is open to you o corinthians our heart is wide
 it is not our feelings to you which are narrow but yours to us
 now to give me back payment of the same sort  i am talking as to my children  let your hearts be wide open to me
 do not keep company with those who have not faith for what is there in common between righteousness and evil or between light and dark
 and what agreement is there between christ and the evil one or what part has one who has faith with one who has not
 and what agreement has the house of god with images for we are a house of the living god even as god has said i will be living among them and walking with them and i will be their god and they will be my people
 for which cause come out from among them and be separate says the lord and let no unclean thing come near you and i will take you for myself
 and will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord the ruler of all
