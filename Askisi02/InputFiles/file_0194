 but he turning about and seeing his disciples said sharply to peter get out of my way satan for your mind is not on the things of god but on the things of men
 and turning to the mass of people with his disciples he said to them if any man has the desire to come after me let him give up all other desires and take up his cross and come after me
 whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news will keep it
 what profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life
 and what would a man give in exchange for his life
 whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation the son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
 and he said to them truly i say to you there are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of god come with power
 and after six days jesus took with him peter and james and john and made them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves and he was changed in form before them
 and his clothing became shining very white as no cleaner on earth would make it
 and there came before them elijah with moses and they were talking with jesus
 and peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tents one for you one for moses and one for elijah
 because he was not certain what to say for they were in great fear
 and a cloud came over them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my dearly loved son give ear to him
 and suddenly looking round about they saw no one any longer but jesus only with themselves
 and while they were coming down from the mountain he gave them orders not to give word to any man of the things they had seen till the son of man had come back from the dead
 and they kept the saying questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be
 and they put a question to him saying why do the scribes say that elijah has to come first
 and he said to them truly elijah does come first and puts all things in order and how is it said in the writings that the son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing
 but i say to you that elijah has come and they have done to him whatever they were pleased to do even as the writings say about him
 and when they came to the disciples they saw a great mass of people about them and scribes questioning them
 and straight away all the people when they saw him were full of wonder and running to him gave him worship
 and he said what are you questioning them about
 and one of the number said to him in answer master i came to you with my son who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking
 and wherever it takes him it puts him down violently streaming at the lips and twisted with pain and his strength goes from him and i made a request to your disciples to send it out and they were not able
 and he said to them in answer o generation without faith how long will i have to be with you how long will i put up with you let him come to me
 and they took him to him and when he saw him the spirit in him straight away became violent and he went down on the earth rolling about and streaming at the lips
 and jesus questioning the father said how long has he been like this and he said from a child
 and frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water for his destruction but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and give us help
 and jesus said to him if you are able  all things are possible to him who has faith
 straight away the father of the child gave a cry saying i have faith make my feeble faith stronger
