 that night the lord came to him in a vision and said i am the god of your father abraham have no fear for i am with you blessing you and your seed will be increased because of my servant abraham
 then he made an altar there and gave worship to the name of the lord and he put up his tents there and there his servants made a water hole
 and abimelech had come to him from gerar with ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his army
 and isaac said to them why have you come to me seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you
 and they said we saw clearly that the lord was with you so we said let there be an oath between us and you and let us make an agreement with you
 that you will do us no damage even as we put no hand on you and did you nothing but good and sent you away in peace and now the blessing of the lord is on you
 then he made a feast for them and they all had food and drink
 and early in the morning they took an oath one to the other then isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace
 and that day isaacs servants came to him and gave him word of the water hole which they had made and said to him we have come to water
 and he gave it the name of shibah so the name of that town is beer sheba to this day
 and when esau was forty years old he took as his wives judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite
 and isaac and rebekah had grief of mind because of them
 now when isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see he sent for esau his first son and said to him my son and he said here am i
 and he said see now i am old and my death may take place at any time
 so take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me
 and make me food good to the taste such as is pleasing to me and put it before me so that i may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me
 now isaacs words to his son were said in rebekahs hearing then esau went out to get the meat
 and rebekah said to jacob her son your father said to your brother esau in my hearing
 go and get some roes meat and make me a good meal so that i may be full and give you my blessing before the lord before my death
 now my son do what i say
 go to the flock and get me two fat young goats and i will make of them a meal to your fathers taste
 and you will take it to him so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death
 and jacob said to rebekah his mother but esau my brother is covered with hair while i am smooth
 if by chance my father puts his hand on me it will seem to him that i am tricking him and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing
 and his mother said let the curse be on me my son only do as i say and go and get them for me
 so he went and got them and took them to his mother and she made a meal to his fathers taste
 and rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son which were with her in the house and put them on jacob her younger son
 and she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck
 and she gave into the hand of jacob her son the meat and the bread which she had made ready
 and he came to his father and said my father and he said here am i who are you my son
