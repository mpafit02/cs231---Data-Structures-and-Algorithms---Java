 take away then the old leaven so that you may be a new mass even as you are without leaven for christ has been put to death as our passover
 let us then keep the feast not with old leaven and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings
 in my letter i said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh
 but i had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church or those who have a desire for and take the property of others or those who give worship to images for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely
 but the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh or had the desire for other peoples property or was in the way of using violent language or being the worse for drink or took by force what was not his you might not keep company with such a one or take food with him
 for it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside but it is yours to be judging those who are among you
 as for those who are outside god is their judge so put away the evil man from among you
 how is it that if any one of you has a cause at law against another he takes it before a gentile judge and not before the saints
 is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world if then the world will be judged by you are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things
 is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels how much more then of the things of this life
 if then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church
 i say this to put you to shame is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers
 but a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before gentile judges
 more than this it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all why not put up with wrong why not undergo loss
 so far from doing this you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers property
 have you not knowledge that evil doers will have no part in the kingdom of god have no false ideas about this no one who goes after the desires of the flesh or gives worship to images or is untrue when married or is less than a man or makes a wrong use of men
 or is a thief or the worse for drink or makes use of strong language or takes by force what is not his will have any part in the kingdom of god
 and such were some of you but you have been washed you have been made holy you have been given righteousness in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
 i am free to do all things but not all things are wise i am free to do all things but i will not let myself come under the power of any
 food is for the stomach and the stomach for food and god will put an end to them together but the body is not for the desires of the flesh but for the lord and the lord for the body
 and god who made the lord jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power
 do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of christ how then may i take what is a part of the body of christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman such a thing may not be
 or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her for god has said the two of them will become one flesh
 but he who is united to the lord is one spirit
 keep away from the desires of the flesh every sin which a man does is outside of the body but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body
 or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the holy spirit which is in you and which has been given to you by god and you are not the owners of yourselves
 for a payment has been made for you let god be honoured in your body
 now as to the things in your letter to me it is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman
 but because of the desires of the flesh let every man have his wife and every woman her husband
 let the husband give to the wife what is right and let the wife do the same to the husband
