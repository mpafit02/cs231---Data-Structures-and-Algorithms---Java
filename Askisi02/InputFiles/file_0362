 for though the army of aram was only a small one the lord gave a very great army into their hands because they had given up the lord the god of their fathers so they put into effect the punishment of joash
 and when they had gone away from him  for he was broken with disease  his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of jehoiada the priest and they put him to death on his bed and they put his body into the earth in the town of david but not in the resting place of the kings
 those who made designs against him were zabad the son of shimeath an ammonite woman and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabite woman
 now the story of his sons and all the words said by the prophet against him and the building up again of the lords house are recorded in the account in the book of the kings and amaziah his son became king in his place
 amaziah was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord but his heart was not completely true to the lord
 now when he became strong in the kingdom he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father
 but he did not put their children to death for he kept the orders of the lord recorded in the book of the law of moses saying the fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
 then amaziah got all judah together and put them in order by their families even all judah and benjamin under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered and they came to three hundred thousand of the best fighting men trained for war and in the use of the spear and the body cover
 and for a hundred talents of silver he got a hundred thousand fighting men from israel
 but a man of god came to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with you for the lord is not with israel that is the children of ephraim
 but go yourself and be strong in war god will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you for god has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers
 then amaziah said to the man of god but what is to be done about the hundred talents which i have given for the armed band of israel and the man of god in answer said god is able to give you much more than this
 so amaziah separating the armed band which had come to him from ephraim sent them back again which made them very angry with judah and they went back burning with wrath
 then amaziah took heart and went out at the head of his people and came to the valley of salt where he put to death ten thousand of the children of seir
 and ten thousand more the children of israel took living and made them go up to the top of the rock pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall
 but the men of the band which amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight made attacks on the towns of judah from samaria to beth horon putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods
 now when amaziah came back from the destruction of the edomites he took the gods of the children of seir and made them his gods worshipping them and burning offerings before them
 and so the wrath of the lord was moved against amaziah and he sent a prophet to him who said why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands
 but while he was talking to him the king said to him have we made you one of the kings government say no more or it will be the cause of your death then the prophet gave up protesting and said it is clear to me that gods purpose is your destruction because you have done this and have not given ear to my words
 then amaziah king of judah acting on the suggestion of his servants sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us have a meeting face to face
 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thorn tree in lebanon sent to the cedar in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
 you say see i have overcome edom and your heart is lifted up with pride now keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and judah with you in danger of downfall
 but amaziah gave no attention and this was the purpose of god so that he might give them up into the hands of joash because they had gone after the gods of edom
 and so joash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah came face to face at beth shemesh in judah
 and judah was overcome before israel and they went in flight every man to his tent
 and joash king of israel made amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz prisoner at beth shemesh and took him to jerusalem and he had the wall of jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of ephraim to the doorway in the angle four hundred cubits
 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the lord under the care of obed edom and all the wealth from the kings house as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to samaria
 amaziah son of joash king of judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of joash the son of jehoahaz king of israel
 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last are they not recorded in the book of the kings of judah and israel
