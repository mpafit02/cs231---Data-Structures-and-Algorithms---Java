 for his wrath is only for a minute in his grace there is life weeping may be for a night but joy comes in the morning
 when things went well for me i said i will never be moved
 lord by your grace you have kept my mountain strong when your face was turned from me i was troubled
 my voice went up to you o lord i made my prayer to the lord
 what profit is there in my blood if i go down into the underworld will the dust give you praise or be a witness to your help
 give ear to me o lord and have mercy on me lord be my helper
 by you my sorrow is turned into dancing you have taken away my clothing of grief and given me robes of joy
 so that my glory may make songs of praise to you and not be quiet o lord my god i will give you praise for ever
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt in you o lord have i put my hope let me never be shamed keep me safe in your righteousness
 let your ear be turned to me take me quickly out of danger be my strong rock my place of strength where i may be safe
 for you are my rock and my strong tower go in front of me and be my guide because of your name
 take me out of the net which they have put ready for me secretly for you are my strength
 into your hands i give my spirit you are my saviour o lord god for ever true
 i am full of hate for those who go after false gods but my hope is in the lord
 i will be glad and have delight in your mercy because you have seen my trouble you have had pity on my soul in its sorrows
 and you have not given me into the hand of my hater you have put my feet in a wide place
 have mercy on me o lord for i am in trouble my eyes are wasted with grief i am wasted in soul and body
 my life goes on in sorrow and my years in weeping my strength is almost gone because of my sin and my bones are wasted away
 because of all those who are against me i have become a word of shame to my neighbours a cause of shaking the head and a fear to my friends those who saw me in the street went in flight from me
 i have gone from mens minds and memory like a dead man i am like a broken vessel
 false statements against me have come to my ears fear was on every side they were talking together against me designing to take away my life
 but i had faith in you o lord i said you are my god
 the chances of my life are in your hand take me out of the hands of my haters and of those who go after me
 let your servant see the light of your face in your mercy be my saviour
 let me not be shamed o lord for i have made my prayer to you let the sinners be shamed and let their mouths be shut in the underworld
 let the false lips be shut which say evil against the upright looking down on him in their pride
 o how great is your grace which you have put in store for your worshippers and which you have made clear to those who had faith in you before the sons of men 
 you will keep them safe in your house from the designs of man in the secret of your tent will you keep them from angry tongues
 may the lord be praised because he has made clear to me the wonder of his grace in a strong town
 and as for me i said in my fear i am cut off from before your eyes but you gave ear to the voice of my prayer when my cry went up to you
