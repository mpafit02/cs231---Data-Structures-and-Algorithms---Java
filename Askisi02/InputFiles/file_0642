 see the lord the lord of armies is cutting off his branches with a great noise and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down
 and he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe and lebanon with its tall trees is coming down
 and there will come a rod out of the broken tree of jesse and a branch out of his roots will give fruit
 and the spirit of the lord will be resting on him the spirit of wisdom and good sense the spirit of wise guiding and strength the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord
 and he will not be guided in his judging by what he sees or give decisions by the hearing of his ears
 but he will do right in the cause of the poor and give wise decisions for those in the land who are in need and the rod of his mouth will come down on the cruel and with the breath of his lips he will put an end to the evil doer
 and righteousness will be the cord of his robe and good faith the band round his breast
 and the wolf will be living with the lamb and the leopard will take his rest with the young goat and the lion will take grass for food like the ox and the young lion will go with the young ones of the herd and a little child will be their guide
 and the cow and the bear will be friends while their young ones are sleeping together
 and the child at the breast will be playing by the hole of the snake and the older child will put his hand on the bright eye of the poison snake
 there will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lord as the sea is covered by the waters
 and in that day the eyes of the nations will be turned to the root of jesse which will be lifted up as the flag of the peoples and his resting place will be glory
 and in that day the hand of the lord will be stretched out the second time to get back the rest of his people from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the sea lands
 and he will put up a flag as a sign to the nations and he will get together those of israel who had been sent away and the wandering ones of judah from the four ends of the earth
 and the envy of ephraim will be gone and those who make trouble for judah will come to an end ephraim will have no more envy of judah and there will be an end of judahs hate for ephraim
 and they will be united in attacking the philistines on the west and together they will take the goods of the children of the east their hand will be on edom and moab and the children of ammon will be under their rule
 and the lord will make the tongue of the egyptian sea completely dry and with his burning wind his hand will be stretched out over the river and it will be parted into seven streams so that men may go over it with dry feet
 and there will be a highway for the rest of his people from assyria as there was for israel in the day when he came up out of the land of egypt
 and in that day you will say i will give praise to you o lord for though you were angry with me your wrath is turned away and i am comforted
 see god is my salvation i will have faith in the lord without fear for the lord jah is my strength and song and he has become my salvation
 so with joy will you get water out of the springs of salvation
 and in that day you will say give praise to the lord let his name be honoured give word of his doings among the peoples say that his name is lifted up
 make a song to the lord for he has done noble things give news of them through all the earth
 let your voice be sounding in a cry of joy o daughter of zion for great is the holy one of israel among you
 the word of the lord about babylon which isaiah the son of amoz saw
 put up a flag on a clear mountain top make a loud outcry to them give directions with the hand so that they may go into the doors of the great ones
 i have given orders to my holy ones i have sent out my men of war those of mine who take pride in their power to give effect to my wrath
 the noise of great numbers in the mountains like the noise of a strong people  the noise of the kingdoms of the nations meeting together  the lord of armies is numbering his forces for war
 they come from a far country from the farthest part of heaven even the lord and the instruments of his wrath with destruction for all the land
 send out a cry of grief for the day of the lord is near it comes as destruction from the most high
