 whoever does gods pleasure the same is my brother and sister and mother
 and again he was teaching by the seaside and a very great number of people had come to him so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat and all the people were on the land by the seaside
 and he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories and said to them in his teaching give ear
 a man went out to put seed in the earth
 and while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took it for food
 and some went on the stones where it had not much earth and it came up straight away because the earth was not deep
 and when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
 and some went among the thorns and the thorns came up and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit
 and some falling on good earth gave fruit coming up and increasing and giving thirty sixty and a hundred times as much
 and he said to them whoever has ears let him give ear
 and when he was by himself those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories
 and he said to them to you is given the secret of the kingdom of god but to those who are outside all things are given in the form of stories
 so that seeing they may see and it will not be clear to them and hearing it they will not get the sense for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness
 and he said to them if you are not clear about this story how will you be clear about the others
 the seed is the word
 and these are they by the wayside where the word is planted and when they have given ear the evil one comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them
 and in the same way these are they who are planted on the stones who when the word has come to their ears straight away take it with joy
 and they have no root in themselves but go on for a time then when trouble comes or pain because of the word they quickly become full of doubts
 and others are those planted among the thorns these are they who have given ear to the word
 and the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth and the desire for other things coming in put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
 and these are they who were planted on the good earth such as give ear to the word and take it into their hearts and give fruit thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much
 and he said to them when the light comes in do people put it under a vessel or under the bed and not on its table
 there is nothing covered which will not be seen openly and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light
 if any man has ears let him give ear
 and he said to them take care what you give ear to in the same measure as you give you will get and more will be given to you
 he who has to him will be given and he who has not from him will be taken even that which he has
 and he said such is the kingdom of god as if a man put seed in the earth
 and went to sleep and got up night and day and the seed came to growth though he had no idea how
 the earth gives fruit by herself first the leaf then the head then the full grain
 but when the grain is ready he quickly sends men to get it cut because the time for cutting has come
