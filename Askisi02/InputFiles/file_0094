 they were stoned they were cut up with knives they were tested they were put to death with the sword they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked
 wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks for whom the world was not good enough
 and not one of these got the good things of the agreement though they all had a good record through faith
 because god had kept some better thing for us so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us
 for this reason as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses putting off every weight and the sin into which we come so readily let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us
 having our eyes fixed on jesus the guide and end of our faith who went through the pains of the cross not caring for the shame because of the joy which was before him and who has now taken his place at the right hand of gods seat of power
 give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose
 till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin
 and you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons my son do not make little of the lords punishment and do not give up hope when you are judged by him
 for the lord sends punishment on his loved ones everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod
 it is for your training that you undergo these things god is acting to you as a father does to his sons for what son does not have punishment from his father
 but if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part then you are not true sons but children of shame
 and again if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect how much more will we be under the authority of the father of spirits and have life
 for they truly gave us punishment for a short time as it seemed good to them but he does it for our profit so that we may become holy as he is
 at the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy but after those who have been trained by it get from it the peace giving fruit of righteousness
 for this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up and let the feeble knees be made strong
 and make straight roads for your feet so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way but may be made strong
 let your desire be for peace with all men and to be made holy without which no man may see the lord
 looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of god for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you and that some of you may be made unclean by it
 and that there may not be any evil liver or any man without respect for god like esau who let his birthright go for a plate of food
 for you have knowledge that even long after when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage he was turned away though he made his request frequently and with weeping because the past might not be changed
 you have not come to a mountain which may be touched and is burning with fire and to a black cloud and a dark smoke and a violent wind
 and to the sound of a horn and the voice of words the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them
 for the order which said if the mountain is touched even by a beast the beast is to be stoned seemed hard to them
 and the vision was so overpowering that even moses said i am shaking and full of fear
 but you have come to the mountain of zion to the place of the living god to the jerusalem which is in heaven and to an army of angels which may not be numbered
 to the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of good men made complete
 and to jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between god and man and to the sign of the blood which says better things than abels blood
 see that you give ear to his voice which comes to you for if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven
 whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth but now he has made an oath saying there will be still one more shaking not only of the earth but of heaven
