 and joseph who was given by the apostles the name of barnabas  the sense of which is son of comfort  a levite and a man of cyprus by birth
 having a field got money for it and put the money at the feet of the apostles
 but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife got money for his property
 and kept back part of the price his wife having knowledge of it and took the rest and put it at the feet of the apostles
 but peter said ananias why has the evil one put it into your heart to be false to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land
 while you had it was it not your property and after you had given it in exchange was it not still in your power how has this purpose come into your mind you have been false not to men but to god
 and at these words ananias went down on the earth and his life went from him and great fear came on all who were present
 and the young men went and made ready his body and took it out and put it in the earth
 and about three hours after his wife having no knowledge of what had taken place came in
 and peter said to her give me an answer was this amount of money the price of the land and she said yes it was
 but peter said to her why have you made an agreement together to be false to the spirit of the lord see the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth are at the door and they will take you out
 and straight away she went down at his feet and her life went from her and the young men came in and saw her dead and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband
 then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things
 now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles and they were all together in solomons covered way
 the others in fear kept back from joining them but the people made much of them
 and a great number of men and women had faith and were joined to the lord
 and they even took into the streets people who were ill and put them on beds so that when peter went by some of them might be in his shade
 and numbers of people came together from the towns round about jerusalem with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits and they were all made well
 but the high priest and those who were with him  the sadducees  were full of envy
 and they took the apostles and put them in the common prison
 but in the night an angel of the lord opening the doors of the prison took them out and said
 go take your place in the temple and give the people all the teaching about this life
 and hearing this they went into the temple at dawn and were teaching but the high priest and those who were with him got together the sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of israel and sent to the prison to get them
 but the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison and came back with the news
 saying the doors of the prison were safely shut and the keepers were at the doors but when they were open there was nobody inside
 now at these words the captain of the temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business
 and someone came and said to them the men whom you put in prison are in the temple teaching the people
 then the captain and some of the police went and took them but not violently for fear that they might be stoned by the people
 and they took them into the sanhedrin and the high priest said to them
 we gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name and now jerusalem is full of your teaching and you are attempting to make us responsible for this mans death
