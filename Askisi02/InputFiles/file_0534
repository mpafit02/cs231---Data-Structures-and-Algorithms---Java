 see in every common saying about you it will be said as the mother is so is her daughter
 you are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children your mother was a hittite and your father an amorite
 your older sister is samaria living at your left hand she and her daughters and your younger sister living at your right hand is sodom and her daughters
 still you have not gone in their ways or done the disgusting things which they have done but as if that was only a little thing you have gone deeper in evil than they in all your ways
 by my life says the lord sodom your sister never did she or her daughters what you and your daughters have done
 truly this was the sin of your sister sodom pride a full measure of food and the comforts of wealth in peace were seen in her and her daughters and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need
 they were full of pride and did what was disgusting to me and so i took them away as you have seen
 and samaria has not done half your sins but you have made the number of your disgusting acts greater than theirs making your sisters seem more upright than you by all the disgusting things which you have done
 and you yourself will be put to shame in that you have given the decision for your sisters through your sins which are more disgusting than theirs they are more upright than you truly you will be shamed and made low for you have made your sisters seem upright
 and i will let their fate be changed the fate of sodom and her daughters and the fate of samaria and her daughters and your fate with theirs
 so that you will be shamed and made low because of all you have done when i have mercy on you
 and your sisters sodom and her daughters will go back to their first condition and samaria and her daughters will go back to their first condition and you and your daughters will go back to your first condition
 was not your sister sodom an oath in your mouth in the day of your pride
 before your shame was uncovered now you have become like her a word of shame to the daughters of edom and all who are round about you the daughters of the philistines who put shame on you round about
 the reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you says the lord
 for this is what the lord has said i will do to you as you have done you who putting the oath on one side have let the agreement be broken
 but still i will keep in mind the agreement made with you in the days when you were young and i will make with you an eternal agreement
 then at the memory of your ways you will be overcome with shame when i take your sisters the older and the younger and give them to you for daughters but not by your agreement
 and i will make my agreement with you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 so that at the memory of these things you may be at a loss never opening your mouth because of your shame when you have my forgiveness for all you have done says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man give out a dark saying and make a comparison for the children of israel
 and say this is what the lord has said a great eagle with great wings full of long feathers of different colours came to lebanon and took the top of the cedar
 biting off the highest of its young branches he took it to the land of canaan and put it in a town of traders
 and he took some of the seed of the land planting it in fertile earth placing it by great waters he put it in like a willow tree
 and its growth went on and it became a vine low and widely stretching whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him so it became a vine putting out branches and young leaves
 and there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers and now this vine pushing out its roots to him sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted so that he might give it water
 he had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine
 say this is what the lord has said will it do well will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots
 and if it is planted will it do well will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind drying up in the bed where it was planted
