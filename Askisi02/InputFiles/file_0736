 under the earth his roots are dry and over it his branch is cut off
 his memory is gone from the earth and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name
 he is sent away from the light into the dark he is forced out of the world
 he has no offspring or family among his people and in his living place there is no one of his name
 at his fate those of the west are shocked and those of the east are overcome with fear
 truly these are the houses of the sinner and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of god
 and job made answer and said
 how long will you make my life bitter crushing me with words
 ten times now you have made sport of me it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong
 and truly if i have been in error the effect of my error is only on myself
 if you make yourselves great against me using my punishment as an argument against me
 be certain that it is god who has done me wrong and has taken me in his net
 truly i make an outcry against the violent man but there is no answer i give a cry for help but no one takes up my cause
 my way is walled up by him so that i may not go by he has made my roads dark
 he has put off my glory from me and taken the crown from my head
 i am broken down by him on every side and i am gone my hope is uprooted like a tree
 his wrath is burning against me and i am to him as one of his haters
 his armies come on together they make their road high against me and put up their tents round mine
 he has taken my brothers far away from me they have seen my fate and have become strange to me
 my relations and my near friends have given me up and those living in my house have put me out of their minds
 i am strange to my women servants and seem to them as one from another country
 at my cry my servant gives me no answer and i have to make a prayer to him
 my breath is strange to my wife and i am disgusting to the offspring of my mothers body
 even young children have no respect for me when i get up their backs are turned on me
 all the men of my circle keep away from me and those dear to me are turned against me
 my bones are joined to my skin and i have got away with my flesh in my teeth
 have pity on me have pity on me o my friends  for the hand of god is on me
 why are you cruel to me like god for ever saying evil against me
 if only my words might be recorded  if they might be put in writing in a book 
 and with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever
