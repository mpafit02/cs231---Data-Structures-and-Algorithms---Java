 i will come and give them punishment and the peoples will come together against them when i give them the reward of their two sins
 and ephraim is a trained cow taking pleasure in crushing the grain but i have put a yoke on her fair neck i will put a horseman on the back of ephraim judah will be working the plough jacob will be turning up the earth
 put in the seed of righteousness get in your grain in mercy let your unploughed earth be turned up for it is time to make search for the lord till he comes and sends righteousness on you like rain
 you have been ploughing sin you have got in a store of evil the fruit of deceit has been your food for you put faith in your way in the number of your men of war
 so a great outcry will go up from among your people and all your strong places will be broken as beth arbel was broken by shalman in the day of war as the mother was broken on the rocks with her children
 so will beth el do to you because of your evil doing at dawn will the king of israel be cut off completely
 when israel was a child he was dear to me and i took my son out of egypt
 when i sent for them then they went away from me they made offerings to the baals burning perfumes to images
 but i was guiding ephraims footsteps i took them up in my arms but they were not conscious that i was ready to make them well
 i made them come after me with the cords of a man with the bands of love i was to them as one who took the yoke from off their mouths putting meat before them
 he will go back to the land of egypt and the assyrian will be his king because they would not come back to me
 and the sword will go through his towns wasting his children and causing destruction because of their evil designs
 my people are given up to sinning against me though their voice goes up on high no one will be lifting them up
 how may i give you up o ephraim how may i be your saviour o israel how may i make you like admah how may i do to you as i did to zeboim my heart is turned in me it is soft with pity
 i will not put into effect the heat of my wrath i will not again send destruction on ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one among you i will not put an end to you
 they will go after the lord his cry will be like that of a lion his cry will be loud and the children will come from the west shaking with fear
 shaking with fear like a bird they will come out of egypt like a dove out of the land of assyria and i will give them rest in their houses says the lord
 the deceit of ephraim and the false words of israel are about me on every side 
 ephraims food is the wind and he goes after the east wind deceit and destruction are increasing day by day they make an agreement with assyria and take oil into egypt
 the lord has a cause against judah and will give punishment to jacob for his ways he will give him the reward of his acts
 in the body of his mother he took his brother by the foot and in his strength he was fighting with god
 he had a fight with the angel and overcame him he made request for grace to him with weeping he came face to face with him in beth el and there his words came to him
 even the lord the god of armies the lord is his name
 so then come back to your god keep mercy and right and be waiting at all times on your god
 as for canaan the scales of deceit are in his hands he takes pleasure in twisted ways
 and ephraim said now i have got wealth and much property in all my works no sin may be seen in me
 but i am the lord your god from the land of egypt i will give you tents for your living places again as in the days of the holy meeting
 my word came to the ears of the prophets and i gave them visions in great number and by the mouths of the prophets i made use of comparisons
 in gilead there is evil they are quite without value in gilgal they make offerings of oxen truly their altars are like masses of stones in the hollows of a ploughed field
 and jacob went in flight into the field of aram and israel became a servant for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep
