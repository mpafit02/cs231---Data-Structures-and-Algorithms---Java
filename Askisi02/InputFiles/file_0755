 the waters are joined together hard as a stone and the face of the deep is covered
 are the bands of the pleiades fixed by you or are the cords of orion made loose
 do you make mazzaroth come out in its right time or are the bear and its children guided by you
 have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens did you give them rule over the earth
 is your voice sent up to the cloud so that you may be covered by the weight of waters
 do you send out the thunder flames so that they may go and say to you here we are
 who has put wisdom in the high clouds or given knowledge to the lights of the north
 by whose wisdom are the clouds numbered or the water skins of the heavens turned to the earth
 when the earth becomes hard as metal and is joined together in masses
 do you go after food for the she lion or get meat so that the young lions may have enough
 when they are stretched out in their holes and are waiting in the brushwood
 who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for when his young ones are crying to god when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food
 have you knowledge of the rock goats or do you see the roes giving birth to their young
 is the number of their months fixed by you or is the time when they give birth ordered by you
 they are bent down they give birth to their young they let loose the fruit of their body
 their young ones are strong living in the open country they go out and do not come back again
 who has let the ass of the fields go free or made loose the bands of the loud voiced beast
 to whom i have given the waste land for a heritage and the salt land as a living place
 he makes sport of the noise of the town the voice of the driver does not come to his ears
 he goes looking for his grass lands in the mountains searching out every green thing
 will the ox of the mountains be your servant or is his nights resting place by your food store
 will he be pulling your plough with cords turning up the valleys after you
 will you put your faith in him because his strength is great will you give the fruit of your work into his care
 will you be looking for him to come back and get in your seed to the crushing floor
 is the wing of the ostrich feeble or is it because she has no feathers
 that she puts her eggs on the earth warming them in the dust
 without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot and broken by the beasts of the field
 she is cruel to her young ones as if they were not hers her work is to no purpose she has no fear
 for god has taken wisdom from her mind and given her no measure of knowledge
 when she is shaking her wings on high she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him
