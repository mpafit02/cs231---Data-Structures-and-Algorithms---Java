 do not be like your fathers and your brothers who were sinners against the lord the god of their fathers so that he made them a cause of fear as you see
 now do not be hard hearted as your fathers were but give yourselves to the lord and come into his holy place which he has made his for ever and be the servants of the lord your god so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from you
 for if you come back to the lord those who took away your brothers and your children will have pity on them and let them come back to this land for the lord your god is full of grace and mercy and his face will not be turned away from you if you come back to him
 so the runners went from town to town through all the country of ephraim and manasseh as far as zebulun but they were laughed at and made sport of
 however some of asher and manasseh and zebulun put away their pride and came to jerusalem
 and in judah the power of god gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains which were taken as the word of the lord
 so a very great number of people came together at jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month
 and they got to work and took away all the altars in jerusalem and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream kidron
 then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the passover lambs to death and the priests and the levites were shamed and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the lord
 and they took their places in their right order as it was ordered in the law of moses the man of god the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the levites
 for there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy so the levites had to put passover lambs to death for those who were not clean to make them holy to the lord
 for a great number of the people from ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not made themselves clean but they took the passover meal though not in the right way for hezekiah had made prayer for them saying may the good lord have mercy on everyone
 who with all his heart is turned to god the lord the god of his fathers even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place
 and the lord gave ear to hezekiah and made the people well
 so the children of israel who were present in jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy and the levites and the priests gave praise to the lord day by day making melody to the lord with loud instruments
 and hezekiah said kind words to the levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the lord so they kept the feast for seven days offering peace offerings and praising the lord the god of their fathers
 and by the desire of all the people the feast went on for another seven days and they kept the seven days with joy
 for hezekiah king of judah gave to the people for offerings a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests made themselves holy
 and all the people of judah with the priests and the levites and those who had come from israel and men from other lands who had come from israel or who were living in judah were glad with great joy
 so there was great joy in jerusalem for nothing like this had been seen in jerusalem from the time of solomon the son of david king of israel
 then the priests and the levites gave the people a blessing and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of god in heaven
 now when all this was over all the men of israel who were present went out into the towns of judah causing the stone pillars to be broken up and the wood pillars to be cut down pulling down the high places and the altars in all judah and benjamin as well as in ephraim and manasseh till all were gone then all the children of israel went back to their towns every man to his property
 then hezekiah put in order the divisions of the priests and levites every man in his division in relation to his work for the burned offerings and peace offerings and for the ordering of worship and for giving praise at the doors of the lords house
 and he gave the kings part of his private property for the burned offerings that is for the morning and evening offerings and the offerings for the sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts as it is recorded in the law of the lord
 in addition he gave orders to the people of jerusalem to give to the priests and levites that part which was theirs by right so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the lord
 and when the order was made public straight away the children of israel gave in great amounts the first fruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey and of the produce of their fields and they took in a tenth part of everything a great store
 and the children of israel and judah who were living in the towns of judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the lord their god and put them in great masses
 the first store of things was put down in the third month and in the seventh month the masses were complete
 and when hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods they gave praise to the lord and to his people israel
 then hezekiah put questions to the priests and levites about the store of goods
