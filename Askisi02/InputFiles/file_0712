 now on the second day after he had put gedaliah to death when no one had knowledge of it
 some people came from shechem from shiloh and samaria eighty men with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order and with cuts on their bodies and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the house of the lord
 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went out from mizpah with the purpose of meeting them weeping on his way and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said come to gedaliah the son of ahikam
 and when they came inside the town ishmael the son of nethaniah and the men who were with him put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole
 but there were ten men among them who said to ishmael do not put us to death for we have secret stores in the country of grain and oil and honey so he did not put them to death with their countrymen
 now the hole into which ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death was the great hole which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah made it full of the bodies of those who had been put to death
 then ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in mizpah the kings daughters and all the people still in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam ishmael the son of nethaniah took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of ammon
 but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him had news of all the evil which ishmael the son of nethaniah had done
 they took their men and went out to make war on ishmael the son of nethaniah and they came face to face with him by the great waters in gibeon
 now when all the people who were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces with him then they were glad
 and all the people whom ishmael had taken away prisoners from mizpah turning round came back and went to johanan the son of kareah
 but ishmael the son of nethaniah got away from johanan with eight men and went to the children of ammon
 then johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the rest of the people whom ishmael the son of nethaniah had made prisoners after he had put to death gedaliah the son of ahikam the people from mizpah that is the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants whom he had taken back with him from gibeon
 and they went and were living in the resting place of chimham which is near beth lehem on the way into egypt
 because of the chaldaeans for they were in fear of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had put to death gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon had made ruler over the land
 then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest came near
 and said to jeremiah the prophet let our request come before you and make prayer for us to the lord your god even for this small band of us for we are only a small band out of what was a great number as your eyes may see
 that the lord your god may make clear to us the way in which we are to go and what we are to do
 then jeremiah the prophet said to them i have given ear to you see i will make prayer to the lord your god as you have said and it will be that whatever the lord may say in answer to you i will give you word of it keeping nothing back
 then they said to jeremiah may the lord be a true witness against us in good faith if we do not do everything which the lord your god sends you to say to us
 if it is good or if it is evil we will be guided by the voice of the lord our god to whom we are sending you so that it may be well for us when we give ear to the voice of the lord our god
 and it came about that after ten days the word of the lord came to jeremiah
 and he sent for johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces who were still with him and all the people from the least to the greatest
 and said to them these are the words of the lord the god of israel to whom you sent me to put your request before him
 if you still go on living in the land then i will go on building you up and not pulling you down planting you and not uprooting you for my purpose of doing evil to you has been changed
 have no fear of the king of babylon of whom you are now in fear have no fear of him says the lord for i am with you to keep you safe and to give you salvation from his hands
 and i will have mercy on you so that he may have mercy on you and let you go back to your land
 but if you say we have no desire to go on living in this land and do not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we will not see war or be hearing the sound of the horn or be in need of food there we will make our living place
 then give ear now to the word of the lord o you last of judah the lord of armies the god of israel has said if your minds are fixed on going into egypt and stopping there
