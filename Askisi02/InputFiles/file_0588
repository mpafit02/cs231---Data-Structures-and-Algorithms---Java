 and lot went out and said to his sons in law who were married to his daughters come let us go out of this place for the lord is about to send destruction on the town but his sons in law did not take him seriously
 and when morning came the angels did all in their power to make lot go saying get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here and go for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town
 but while he was waiting the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand for the lord had mercy on them and put them outside the town
 and when they had put them out he said go for your life without looking back or waiting in the lowland go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction
 and lot said to them not so o my lord
 see now your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction but i am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death
 this town now is near and it is a little one o let me go there  is it not a little one  so that my life may be safe
 and he said see i have given you your request in this one thing more i will not send destruction on this town
 go there quickly for i am not able to do anything till you have come there for this reason the town was named zoar
 the sun was up when lot came to zoar
 then the lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on sodom and gomorrah
 and he sent destruction on those towns with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land
 but lots wife looking back became a pillar of salt
 and abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the lord
 and looking in the direction of sodom and gomorrah and the lowland he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven
 so it came about that when god sent destruction on the towns of the lowland he kept his word to abraham and sent lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living
 then lot went up out of zoar to the mountain and was living there with his two daughters for fear kept him from living in zoar and he and his daughters made their living place in a hole in the rock
 and the older daughter said to her sister our father is old and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way
 come let us give our father much wine and we will go into his bed so that we may have offspring by our father
 and that night they made their father take much wine and the older daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
 and on the day after the older daughter said to the younger last night i was with my father let us make him take much wine this night again and do you go to him so that we may have offspring by our father
 and that night again they made their father take much wine and the younger daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
 and so the two daughters of lot were with child by their father
 and the older daughter had a son and she gave him the name moab he is the father of the moabites to this day
 and the younger had a son and gave him the name ben ammi from him come the children of ammon to this day
 and the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete
 and on the seventh day god came to the end of all his work and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done
 and god gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done
 these are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made
 in the day when the lord god made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth and no grass had come up for the lord god had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land
