 for this cause nets are round your feet and you are overcome with sudden fear
 your light is made dark so that you are unable to see and you are covered by a mass of waters
 is not god as high as heaven and see the stars how high they are 
 and you say what knowledge has god is he able to give decisions through the deep dark
 thick clouds are covering him so that he is unable to see and he is walking on the arch of heaven
 will you keep the old way by which evil men went
 who were violently taken away before their time who were overcome by the rush of waters
 who said to god go away from us and what is the ruler of all able to do to us
 though he made their houses full of good things but the purpose of the evil doers is far from me 
 the upright saw it and were glad and those who had done no wrong made sport of them
 saying truly their substance is cut off and their wealth is food for the fire
 put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace so will you do well in your undertakings
 be pleased to take teaching from his mouth and let his words be stored up in your heart
 if you come back to the ruler of all making yourself low before him if you put evil far away from your tents
 and put your gold in the dust even your gold of ophir among the rocks of the valleys
 then the ruler of all will be your gold and his teaching will be your silver
 for then you will have delight in the ruler of all and your face will be lifted up to god
 you will make your prayer to him and be answered and you will give effect to your oaths
 your purposes will come about and light will be shining on your ways
 for god makes low those whose hearts are lifted up but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit
 he makes safe the man who is free from sin and if your hands are clean salvation will be yours
 and job made answer and said
 even today my outcry is bitter his hand is hard on my sorrow
 if only i had knowledge of where he might be seen so that i might come even to his seat 
 i would put my cause in order before him and my mouth would be full of arguments
 i would see what his answers would be and have knowledge of what he would say to me
 would he make use of his great power to overcome me no but he would give attention to me
 there an upright man might put his cause before him and i would be free for ever from my judge
 see i go forward but he is not there and back but i do not see him
 i am looking for him on the left hand but there is no sign of him and turning to the right i am not able to see him
