 no passover like it had been kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet and not one of the kings of israel had ever kept a passover like the one kept by josiah and the priests and the levites and all those of judah and israel who were present and the people of jerusalem
 in the eighteenth year of the rule of josiah this passover was kept
 after all this and after josiah had put the house in order neco king of egypt went up to make war at carchemish by the river euphrates and josiah went out against him
 but he sent representatives to him saying what have i to do with you o king of judah i have not come against you this day but against those with whom i am at war and god has given me orders to go forward quickly keep out of gods way for he is with me or he will send destruction on you
 however josiah would not go back but keeping to his purpose of fighting against him and giving no attention to the words of neco which came from god he went forward to the fight in the valley of megiddo
 and the bowmen sent their arrows at king josiah and the king said to his servants take me away for i am badly wounded
 so his servants took him out of the line of war carriages and put him in his second carriage and took him to jerusalem where he came to his end and they put his body in the resting place of his fathers and in all judah and jerusalem there was great weeping for josiah
 and jeremiah made a song of grief for josiah and to this day josiah is named by all the makers of melody men and women in their songs of grief they made it a rule in israel and the songs are recorded among the songs of grief
 now the rest of the acts of josiah and the good he did in keeping with what is recorded in the law of the lord
 and all his acts first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of israel and judah
 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in jerusalem in place of his father
 jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months
 then the king of egypt took the kingdom from him in jerusalem and put on the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem changing his name to jehoiakim and neco took his brother jehoahaz away to egypt
 jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years and he did evil in the eyes of the lord his god
 nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against him and took him away in chains to babylon
 and nebuchadnezzar took away some of the vessels of the lords house and put them in the house of his god in babylon
 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and the disgusting things he did and all there is to be said against him are recorded in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son became king in his place
 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months and ten days and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 in the spring of the year king nebuchadnezzar sent and took him away to babylon with the beautiful vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his fathers brother king over judah and jerusalem
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord and did not make himself low before jeremiah the prophet who gave him the word of the lord
 and he took up arms against king nebuchadnezzar though he had made him take an oath by god but he made his neck stiff and his heart hard turning away from the lord the god of israel
 and more than this all the great men of judah and the priests and the people made their sin great turning to all the disgusting ways of the nations and they made unclean the house of the lord which he had made holy in jerusalem
 and the lord the god of their fathers sent word to them by his servants sending early and frequently because he had pity on his people and on his living place
 but they put shame on the servants of god making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets till the wrath of god was moved against his people till there was no help
 so he sent against them the king of the chaldaeans who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place and had no pity for any young man or virgin old man or white haired god gave them all into his hands
 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the stored wealth of the lords house and the wealth of the king and his chiefs he took away to babylon
 and the house of god was burned and the wall of jerusalem broken down all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction
 and all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to babylon and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of persia came to power
