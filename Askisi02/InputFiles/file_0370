 and he put the altar of the lord in order offering peace offerings and praise offerings on it and said that all judah were to be servants of the lord the god of israel
 however the people still made offerings in the high places but only to the lord their god
 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer to his god and the words which the seers said to him in the name of the lord the god of israel are recorded among the acts of the kings of israel
 and the prayer which he made to god and how god gave him an answer and all his sin and his wrongdoing and the places where he made high places and put up pillars of wood and images before he put away his pride are recorded in the history of the seers
 so manasseh went to rest with his fathers and they put his body to rest in his house and amon his son became king in his place
 amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling for two years in jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as manasseh his father had done and amon made offerings to all the images which his father manasseh had made and was their servant
 he did not make himself low before the lord as his father manasseh had done but went on sinning more and more
 and his servants made a secret design against him and put him to death in his house
 but the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against king amon and made his son josiah king in his place
 josiah was eight years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for thirty one years
 and he did what was right in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of his father david without turning to the right hand or to the left
 in the eighth year of his rule while he was still young his heart was first turned to the god of his father david and in the twelfth year he undertook the clearing away of all the high places and the pillars and the images of wood and metal from judah and jerusalem
 he had the altars of the baals broken down while he himself was present and the sun images which were placed on high over them he had cut down and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust dropping the dust over the resting places of the dead who had made offerings to them
 and he had the bones of the priests burned on their altars and so he made judah and jerusalem clean
 and in all the towns of manasseh and ephraim and simeon as far as naphtali he made waste their houses round about
 he had the altars and the pillars of wood pulled down and the images crushed to dust and all the sun images cut down through all the land of israel and then he went back to jerusalem
 now in the eighteenth year of his rule when the land and the house had been made clean he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the ruler of the town and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to make good what was damaged in the house of the lord his god
 and they came to hilkiah the chief priest and gave him all the money which had been taken into the house of god which the levites the keepers of the door had got from manasseh and ephraim and those of israel who had not been taken away as prisoners and from all judah and benjamin and the people of jerusalem
 and they gave it to the overseers of the work of the lords house and the overseers gave it to the workmen working in the house for building it up and making good what was damaged
 even to the woodworkers and builders to get cut stone and wood for joining the structure together and for making boards for the houses which the kings of judah had given up to destruction
 and the men did the work well and those who had authority over them were jahath and obadiah levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites who were to be responsible for seeing that the work was done and others of the levites who were expert with instruments of music
 had authority over the transport workers giving directions to all who were doing any sort of work and among the levites there were scribes and overseers and door keepers
 now when they were taking out the money which had come into the lords house hilkiah the priest came across the book of the law of the lord which he had given by the mouth of moses
 then hilkiah said to shaphan the scribe i have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan
 and shaphan took the book to the king and he gave him an account of what had been done saying your servants are doing all they have been given to do
 they have taken out all the money which was in the lords house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen
 then shaphan the scribe said to the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he made a start at reading some of it to the king
 and the king hearing the words of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
 and he gave orders to hilkiah and to ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying
