 only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were there was no ice storm
 then pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said to them i have done evil this time the lord is upright and i and my people are sinners
 make prayer to the lord for there has been enough of these thunderings of god and this ice storm and i will let you go and will keep you no longer
 and moses said when i am gone outside the town my hands will be stretched out to the lord the thunders and the ice storm will come to an end so that you may see that the earth is the lords
 but as for you and your servants i am certain that even now the fear of the lord god will not be in your hearts
 and the flax and the barley were damaged for the barley was almost ready to be cut and the flax was in flower
 but the rest of the grain plants were undamaged for they had not come up
 so moses went out of the town and stretching out his hands made prayer to god and the thunders and the ice storm came to an end and the fall of rain was stopped
 but when pharaoh saw that the rain and the ice storm and the thunders were ended he went on sinning and made his heart hard he and his servants
 and the heart of pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go as the lord had said by the mouth of moses
 now it came about in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day of the month while i was by the river chebar among those who had been made prisoners that the heavens were made open and i saw visions of god
 on the fifth day of the month in the fifth year after king jehoiachin had been made a prisoner
 the word of the lord came to me ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldaeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was on me there
 and looking i saw a storm wind coming out of the north a great cloud with flames of fire coming after one another and a bright light shining round about it and in the heart of it was something coloured like electrum
 and in the heart of it were the forms of four living beings and this was what they were like they had the form of a man
 and every one had four faces and every one of them had four wings
 and their feet were straight feet and the under sides of their feet were like the feet of oxen and they were shining like polished brass
 and they had the hands of a man under their wings the four of them had faces on their four sides
 they went without turning every one went straight forward
 as for the form of their faces they had the face of a man and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side and the four of them had the face of an eagle
 and their wings were separate at the top two of the wings of every one were joined one to another and two were covering their bodies
 every one of them went straight forward wherever the spirit was to go they went they went on without turning
 and between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings and the fire was bright and out of the fire went thunder flames
 and the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunder flame
 now while i was looking at the four living beings i saw one wheel on the earth by the side of the living beings for the four of them
 the form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl the four of them had the same form and design and they were like a wheel inside a wheel
 the four of them went straight forward without turning to one side
 and i saw that they had edges and their edges even of the four were full of eyes round about
 and when the living beings went on the wheels went by their side and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
 wherever the spirit was to go they went and the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
