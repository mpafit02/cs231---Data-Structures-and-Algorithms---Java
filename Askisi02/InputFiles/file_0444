 let your circumcision be of the heart and put away your pride
 for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords the great god strong in power and greatly to be feared who has no respect for any mans position and takes no rewards
 judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country
 so be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of egypt
 let the fear of the lord your god be before you give him worship and be true to him at all times taking your oaths in his name
 he is your god the god of your praise your god who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen
 your fathers went down into egypt with seventy persons and now the lord your god has made you like the stars of heaven in number
 so have love for the lord your god and give him worship and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times
 and be certain in your minds this day for these words are not said to your children who have had no experience of the training of the lord your god and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched out arm
 or his signs and wonders which he did in egypt to pharaoh king of egypt and all his land
 and what he did to the army of egypt to their horses and their war carriages how he made the waters of the red sea come up over them when they went after you and how the lord put an end to them even to this day
 and what he did for you in the waste land till you came to this place
 and what he did to dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben when they went down into the open mouth of the earth with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs before the eyes of all israel
 but your eyes have seen all the great works of the lord which he has done
 so keep all the orders which i give you today so that you may be strong and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage
 and that your days may be long in the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them a land flowing with milk and honey
 for the land where you are going is not like the land of egypt from which you have come where you put in your seeds watering them with your foot like a planted garden
 but the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys drinking in the rain of heaven
 a land cared for by the lord your god the eyes of the lord your god are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other
 and it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which i put before you this day loving the lord your god and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul
 then i will send rain on your land at the right time the early rains and the late rains so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil
 and i will give grass in your fields for your cattle so that you may have food in full measure
 but take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods
 for if you do so the wrath of the lord will be burning against you and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit and in a very little time you will be cut off from the good land which the lord is giving you
 so keep these words deep in your heart and in your soul and have them fixed on your hand for a sign and marked on your brow
 teaching them to your children and talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
 writing them on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
 so that your days and the days of your children may be long in the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give them like the days of the eternal heavens
 for if you take care to keep all the orders which i give you and to do them loving the lord your god and walking in all his ways and being true to him
 then the lord will send these nations in flight before you and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves
