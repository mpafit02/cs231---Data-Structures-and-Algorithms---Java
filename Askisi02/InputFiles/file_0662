 you who give good news to zion get up into the high mountain you who give good news to jerusalem let your voice be strong let it be sounding without fear say to the towns of judah see your god 
 see the lord god will come as a strong one ruling in power see those made free by him are with him and those whom he has made safe go before him
 he will give food to his flock like a keeper of sheep with his arm he will get it together and will take up the lambs on his breast gently guiding those which are with young
 in the hollow of whose hand have the waters been measured and who is able to take the heavens in his stretched out fingers who has got together the dust of the earth in a measure who has taken the weight of the mountains or put the hills into the scales
 by whom has the spirit of the lord been guided or who has been his teacher
 who gave him suggestions and made clear to him the right way who gave him knowledge guiding him in the way of wisdom
 see the nations are to him like a drop hanging from a bucket and like the small dust in the scales he takes up the islands like small dust
 and lebanon is not enough to make a fire with or all its cattle enough for a burned offering
 all the nations are as nothing before him even less than nothing a thing of no value
 whom then is god like in your opinion or what will you put forward as a comparison with him
 the workman makes an image and the gold worker puts gold plates over it and makes silver bands for it
 the wise workman makes selection of the mulberry tree of the offering a wood which will not become soft so that the image may be fixed to it and not be moved
 have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears has not news of it been given to you from the first has it not been clear to you from the time when the earth was placed on its base
 it is he who is seated over the arch of the earth and the people in it are as small as locusts by him the heavens are stretched out like an arch and made ready like a tent for a living place
 he makes rulers come to nothing the judges of the earth are of no value
 they have only now been planted and their seed put into the earth and they have only now taken root when he sends out his breath over them and they become dry and the storm wind takes them away like dry grass
 who then seems to you to be my equal says the holy one
 let your eyes be lifted up on high and see who has made these he who sends out their numbered army who has knowledge of all their names by whose great strength because he is strong in power all of them are in their places
 why do you say o jacob such words as these o israel the lords eyes are not on my way and my god gives no attention to my cause
 have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears the eternal god the lord the maker of the ends of the earth is never feeble or tired there is no searching out of his wisdom
 he gives power to the feeble increasing the strength of him who has no force
 even the young men will become feeble and tired and the best of them will come to the end of his strength
 but those who are waiting for the lord will have new strength they will get wings like eagles running they will not be tired and walking they will have no weariness
 come quietly before me o sea lands and let the peoples get together their strength let them come near then let them say what they have to say let us put forward our cause against one another
 who sent out from the east one who is right wherever he goes he gives the nations into his hands and makes him ruler over kings he gives them as the dust to his sword as dry stems before the wind to his bow
 he goes after them safely not touching the road with his feet
 whose purpose and work was it his who sent out the generations from the start i the lord the first and with the last i am he
 the sea lands saw it and were in fear the ends of the earth were shaking they came near
 they gave help everyone to his neighbour and everyone said to his brother take heart 
 so the metal worker put heart into the gold worker and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron worker saying of the plate it is ready and he put it together with nails so that there might be no slipping
