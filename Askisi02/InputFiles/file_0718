 word has come to me from the lord and a representative has been sent to the nations to say come together and go up against her and take your places for the fight
 for see i have made you small among the nations looked down on by men
  the pride of your heart has been a false hope o you who are living in the cracks of the rock keeping your place on the top of the hill even if you made your living place as high as the eagle i would make you come down says the lord
 and edom will become a cause of wonder everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of fear at all her punishments
 as at the downfall of sodom and gomorrah and their neighbouring towns says the lord no man will be living in it no son of man will have a resting place there
 see he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of jordan against the resting place of teman but i will suddenly make him go in flight from her and i will put over her the man of my selection for who is like me and who will put forward his cause against me and what keeper of sheep will be able to keep his place before me
 for this cause give ear to the decision of the lord which he has made against edom and to his purposes designed against the people of teman truly they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock truly he will make waste their fields with them
 the earth is shaking with the noise of their fall their cry is sounding in the red sea
 see he will come up like an eagle in flight stretching out his wings against bozrah and the hearts of edoms men of war on that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth pains
 about damascus hamath is put to shame and arpad for the word of evil has come to their ears their heart in its fear is turned to water it will not be quiet
 damascus has become feeble she is turned to flight fear has taken her in its grip pain and sorrows have come on her as on a woman in birth pains
 how has the town of praise been wasted the place of joy 
 so her young men will be falling in her streets and all the men of war will be cut off in that day says the lord of armies
 and i will have a fire lighted on the wall of damascus burning up the great houses of ben hadad
 about kedar and the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon overcame this is what the lord has said up  go against kedar and make an attack on the children of the east
 their tents and their flocks they will take they will take away for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels they will give a cry to them fear on every side
 go in flight go wandering far off take cover in deep places o people of hazor says the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon has made a design against you he has a purpose against you in mind
 up  go against a nation which is living in comfort and without fear of danger says the lord without doors or locks living by themselves
 and their camels will be taken from them by force and their great herds will come into the hands of their attackers those who have the ends of their hair cut i will send in flight to all the winds and i will send their fate on them from every side says the lord
 and hazor will be a hole for jackals a waste for ever no one will be living in it and no son of man will have a resting place there
 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet about elam when zedekiah first became king of judah saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will have the bow of elam their chief strength broken
 and i will send on elam four winds from the four quarters of heaven driving them out to all those winds there will be no nation into which the wanderers from elam do not come
 and i will let elam be broken before their haters and before those who are making designs against their lives i will send evil on them even my burning wrath says the lord and i will send the sword after them till i have put an end to them
 i will put the seat of my power in elam and in elam i will put an end to kings and rulers says the lord
 but it will come about that in the last days i will let the fate of elam be changed says the lord
 go quickly through the streets of jerusalem and see now and get knowledge and make a search in her wide places if there is a man if there is one in her who is upright who keeps faith and she will have my forgiveness
 and though they say by the living lord truly their oaths are false
 o lord do not your eyes see good faith you have given them punishment but they were not troubled you have sent destruction on them but they did not take your teaching to heart they have made their faces harder than a rock they would not come back
 then i said but these are the poor they are foolish for they have no knowledge of the way of the lord or of the behaviour desired by their god
