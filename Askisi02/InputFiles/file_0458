 and that he will make you high over all the nations he has made in praise in name and in honour and that you are to be a holy people to the lord your god as he has said
 then moses and the responsible men of israel gave the people these orders keep all the orders which i have given you this day
 and on the day when you go over jordan into the land which the lord your god is giving you put up great stones coating them with building paste
 and writing on them all the words of this law after you have gone over so that you may take the heritage which the lord your god is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey as the lord the god of your fathers has said
 and when you have gone over jordan you are to put up these stones as i have said to you today in mount ebal and have them coated with building paste
 there you are to make an altar to the lord your god of stones on which no iron instrument has been used
 you are to make the altar of the lord your god of uncut stones offering on it burned offerings to the lord your god
 and you are to make your peace offerings feasting there with joy before the lord your god
 and put on the stones all the words of this law writing them very clearly
 then moses and the priests the levites said to all israel be quiet and give ear o israel today you have become the people of the lord your god
 for this cause you are to give ear to the voice of the lord your god and do his orders and his laws which i give you this day
 that same day moses said to the people

 and these are to be on mount ebal for the curse reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali
 then the levites are to say in a loud voice to all the men of israel

 cursed is he who does not give honour to his father or mother and let all the people say so be it

 cursed is he who for a reward puts to death one who has done no wrong and let all the people say so be it

 now if you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and keep with care all these orders which i have given you today then the lord your god will put you high over all the nations of the earth
 and all these blessings will come on you and overtake you if your ears are open to the voice of the lord your god
