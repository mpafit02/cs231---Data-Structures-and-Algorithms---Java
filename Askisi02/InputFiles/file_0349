 and his base was at ramah where his house was there he was judge of israel and there he made an altar to the lord
 now when samuel was old he made his sons judges over israel
 the name of his first son was joel and the name of his second abijah they were judges in beer sheba
 and his sons did not go in his ways but moved by the love of money took rewards and were not upright in judging
 then all the responsible men of israel got together and went to samuel at ramah
 and said to him see now you are old and your sons do not go in your ways give us a king now to be our judge so that we may be like the other nations
 but samuel was not pleased when they said to him give us a king to be our judge and samuel made prayer to the lord
 and the lord said to samuel give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you they have not been turned away from you but they have been turned away from me not desiring me to be king over them
 as they have done from the first from the day when i took them out of egypt till this day turning away from me and worshipping other gods so now they are acting in the same way to you
 give ear now to their voice but make a serious protest to them and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler
 and samuel said all these words of the lord to the people who were desiring a king
 and he said this is the sort of king who will be your ruler he will take your sons and make them his servants his horsemen and drivers of his war carriages and they will go running before his war carriages
 and he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war carriages
 your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread makers
 he will take your fields and your vine gardens and your olive gardens all the best of them and give them to his servants
 he will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants
 he will take your men servants and your servant girls and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work
 he will take a tenth of your sheep and you will be his servants
 then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves but the lord will not give you an answer in that day
 but the people gave no attention to the voice of samuel and they said no but we will have a king over us
 so that we may be like the other nations and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war
 then samuel after hearing all the people had to say went and gave an account of it to the lord
 and the lord said to samuel give ear to their voice and make a king for them then samuel said to the men of israel let every man go back to his town
 now there was a man of benjamin named kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of becorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a man of wealth
 he had a son named saul a specially good looking young man there was no one better looking among the children of israel he was taller by a head than any other of the people
 now the asses of sauls father kish had gone wandering away and kish said to his son saul take one of the servants with you and get up and go in search of the asses
 so they went through the hill country of ephraim and through the land of shalishah but they saw no sign of them then they went through the land of shaalim but they were not there and they went through the land of the benjamites but they did not come across them
 and when they had come to the land of zuph saul said to the servant who was with him come let us go back or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us
 but the servant said to him see now in this town there is a man of god who is highly honoured and everything he says comes true let us go there now it may be that he will give us directions about our journey
 then saul said to his servant but if we go what are we to take the man all our bread is gone and we have no offering to take to the man of god what are we to do
