 let them be overcome and put to shame who make attempts to take my soul let those who would do me damage be turned back and made foolish
 let them be like dust from the grain before the wind let the angel of the lord send them in flight
 let their way be dark and full of danger let them be troubled by the angel of the lord
 for without cause they have put a net ready for me secretly in which to take my soul
 let destruction come on them without their knowledge let them be taken themselves in their secret nets falling into the same destruction
 and my soul will have joy in the lord it will be glad in his salvation
 all my bones will say lord who is like you the saviour of the poor man from the hands of the strong of him who is poor and in need from him who takes his goods
 false witnesses got up they put questions to me about crimes of which i had no knowledge
 they gave me back evil for good troubling my soul
 but as for me when they were ill i put on the clothing of sorrow i went without food and was sad and my prayer came back again to my heart
 my behaviour was as if it had been my friend or my brother i was bent low in grief like one whose mother is dead
 but they took pleasure in my trouble and came together yes low persons came together against me without my knowledge they never came to an end of wounding me
 like men of deceit they put me to shame the voice of their wrath was loud against me
 lord how long will you be looking on take my soul from their destruction my life from the lions
 i will give you praise in the great meeting i will give you honour among a strong people
 do not let my haters be glad over me falsely let not those who are against me without cause make sport of me
 for they do not say words of peace in their deceit they are designing evil things against the quiet ones in the land
 their mouths were open wide against me and they said aha aha our eyes have seen it
 you have seen this o lord be not unmoved o lord be not far from me
 be awake o lord be moved to take up my cause my god and my lord
 be my judge o lord my god in your righteousness do not let them be glad over me
 let them not say in their hearts so we will have it let them not say we have put an end to him
 let all those who take pleasure in my troubles be shamed and come to nothing let those who are lifted up against me be covered with shame and have no honour
 let those who are on my side give cries of joy let them ever say the lord be praised for he has pleasure in the peace of his servant
 and my tongue will be talking of your righteousness and of your praise all the day
 &ltto the chief music maker of the servant of the lord of david&gt the sin of the evil doer says in his heart there is no fear of the lord before his eyes
 for he takes comfort in the thought that his sin will not be uncovered and hated
 in the words of his mouth are evil and deceit he has given up being wise and doing good
 he gives thought to evil on his bed he takes a way which is not good he is not a hater of evil
 your mercy o lord is in the heavens and your strong purpose is as high as the clouds
