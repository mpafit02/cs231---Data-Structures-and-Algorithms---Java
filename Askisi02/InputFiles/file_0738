 though he takes care of it and does not let it go but keeps it still in his mouth
 his food becomes bitter in his stomach the poison of snakes is inside him
 he takes down wealth as food and sends it up again it is forced out of his stomach by god
 he takes the poison of snakes into his mouth the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death
 let him not see the rivers of oil the streams of honey and milk
 he is forced to give back the fruit of his work and may not take it for food he has no joy in the profit of his trading
 because he has been cruel to the poor turning away from them in their trouble because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up
 there is no peace for him in his wealth and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight
 he had never enough for his desire for this cause his well being will quickly come to an end
 even when his wealth is great he is full of care for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him
 god gives him his desire and sends the heat of his wrath on him making it come down on him like rain
 he may go in flight from the iron spear but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him
 he is pulling it out and it comes out of his back and its shining point comes out of his side he is overcome by fears
 all his wealth is stored up for the dark a fire not made by man sends destruction on him and on everything in his tent
 the heavens make clear his sin and the earth gives witness against him
 the produce of his house is taken away into another country like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath
 this is the reward of the evil man and the heritage given to him by god
 then job made answer and said
 give attention with care to my words and let this be your comfort
 let me say what is in my mind and after that go on making sport of me
 as for me is my outcry against man is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled
 take note of me and be full of wonder put your hand on your mouth
 at the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear
 why is life given to the evil doers why do they become old and strong in power
 their children are ever with them and their offspring before their eyes
 their houses are free from fear and the rod of god does not come on them
 their ox is ready at all times to give seed their cow gives birth without dropping her young
 they send out their young ones like a flock and their children have pleasure in the dance
 they make songs to the instruments of music and are glad at the sound of the pipe
 their days come to an end without trouble and suddenly they go down to the underworld
