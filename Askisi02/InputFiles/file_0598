 and jacob said i am esau your oldest son i have done as you said come now be seated and take of my meat so that you may give me a blessing
 and isaac said how is it that you have got it so quickly my son and he said because the lord your god made it come my way
 and isaac said come near so that i may put my hand on you my son and see if you are truly my son esau or not
 and jacob went near his father isaac and he put his hands on him and he said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
 and he did not make out who he was because his hands were covered with hair like his brother esaus hands so he gave him a blessing
 and he said are you truly my son esau and he said i am
 and he said put it before me and i will take of my sons meat so that i may give you a blessing and he put it before him and he took it and he gave him wine and he had a drink
 and his father isaac said to him come near now my son and give me a kiss
 and he came near and gave him a kiss and smelling the smell of his clothing he gave him a blessing and said see the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the lord has come
 may god give you the dew of heaven and the good things of the earth and grain and wine in full measure
 let peoples be your servants and nations go down before you be lord over your brothers and let your mothers sons go down before you a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed and a blessing on those who give you a blessing
 and when isaac had come to the end of blessing jacob and jacob had not long gone away from isaac his father esau came in from the field
 and he made ready a meal good to the taste and took it to his father and said to him let my father get up and take of his sons meat so that you may give me a blessing
 and isaac his father said to him who are you and he said i am your oldest son esau
 and in great fear isaac said who then is he who got meat and put it before me and i took it all before you came and gave him a blessing and his it will be
 and hearing the words of his father esau gave a great and bitter cry and said to his father give a blessing to me even to me o my father 
 and he said your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing
 and he said is it because he is named jacob that he has twice taken my place for he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing and he said have you not kept a blessing for me
 and isaac answering said but i have made him your master and have given him all his brothers for servants i have made him strong with grain and wine what then am i to do for you my son
 and esau said to his father is that the only blessing you have my father give a blessing to me even me  and esau was overcome with weeping
 then isaac his father made answer and said to him far from the fertile places of the earth and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living place be
 by your sword will you get your living and you will be your brothers servant but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck
 so esau was full of hate for jacob because of his fathers blessing and he said in his heart the days of weeping for my father are near then i will put my brother jacob to death
 then rebekah hearing what esau had said sent for jacob her younger son and said to him it seems that your brother esau is purposing to put you to death
 so now my son do what i say go quickly to haran to my brother laban
 and be there with him for a little time till your brothers wrath is turned away
 till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry then i will send word for you to come back are the two of you to be taken from me in one day
 then rebekah said to isaac my life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of heth if jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of heth such as these the women of this land of what use will my life be to me
 then isaac sent for jacob and blessing him said do not take a wife from among the women of canaan
 but go to paddan aram to the house of bethuel your mothers father and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of laban your mothers brother
