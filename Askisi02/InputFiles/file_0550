 and it came about in the twelfth year in the twelfth month on the first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make a song of grief for pharaoh king of egypt and say to him young lion of the nations destruction has come on you and you were like a sea beast in the seas sending out bursts of water troubling the waters with your feet making their streams dirty
 this is what the lord has said my net will be stretched out over you and i will take you up in my fishing net
 and i will let you be stretched on the land i will send you out violently into the open field i will let all the birds of heaven come to rest on you and will make the beasts of all the earth full of you
 and i will put your flesh on the mountains and make the valleys full of your blood
 and the land will be watered with your blood and the waterways will be full of you
 and when i put out your life the heaven will be covered and its stars made dark i will let the sun be covered with a cloud and the moon will not give her light
 all the bright lights of heaven i will make dark over you and put dark night on your land says the lord
 and the hearts of numbers of peoples will be troubled when i send your prisoners among the nations into a country which is strange to you
 and i will make a number of peoples overcome with wonder at you and their kings will be full of fear because of you when my sword is waved before them they will be shaking every minute every man fearing for his life in the day of your fall
 for this is what the lord has said the sword of the king of babylon will come on you
 i will let the swords of the strong be the cause of the fall of your people all of them men to be feared among the nations and they will make waste the pride of egypt and all its people will come to destruction
 and i will put an end to all her beasts which are by the great waters and they will never again be troubled by the foot of man or by the feet of beasts
 then i will make their waters clear and their rivers will be flowing like oil says the lord
 when i make egypt an unpeopled waste cutting off from the land all the things in it when i send punishment on all those living in it then it will be clear to them that i am the lord
 it is a song of grief and people will give voice to it the daughters of the nations will give voice to it even for egypt and all her people says the lord
 and in the twelfth year on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your voice be loud in sorrow for the people of egypt and send them down even you and the daughters of the nations i will send them down into the lowest parts of the earth with those who go down into the underworld
 are you more beautiful than any go down and take your rest among those without circumcision
 among those who have been put to the sword they will give a resting place with them to all their people
 the strong among the great ones will say to him from the underworld are you more beautiful than any go down you and your helpers and take your rest among those without circumcision and those who have been put to the sword
 there is asshur and all her army round about her last resting place all of them put to death by the sword
 whose resting places are in the inmost parts of the underworld who were a cause of fear in the land of the living
 there is elam and all her people round about her last resting place all of them put to death by the sword who have gone down without circumcision into the lowest parts of the earth who were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
 they have made a bed for her among the dead and all her people are round about her resting place all of them without circumcision put to death with the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld they have been given a place among those who have been put to the sword
 there is meshech tubal and all her people round about her last resting place all of them without circumcision put to death by the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living
 and they have been put to rest with the fighting men who came to their end in days long past who went down to the underworld with their instruments of war placing their swords under their heads and their body covers are over their bones for their strength was a cause of fear in the land of the living
 but you will have your bed among those without circumcision and will be put to rest with those who have been put to death with the sword
 there is edom her kings and all her princes who have been given a resting place with those who were put to the sword they will be resting among those without circumcision even with those who go down to the underworld
 there are the chiefs of the north all of them and all the zidonians who have gone down with those who have been put to the sword they are shamed on account of all the fear caused by their strength they are resting there without circumcision among those who have been put to the sword and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
