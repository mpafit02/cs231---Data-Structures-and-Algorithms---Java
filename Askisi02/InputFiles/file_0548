 then i was lifted up by the wind and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the lord was lifted up from his place
 and there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels at their side the sound of a great rushing
 and the wind lifting me up took me away and i went in the heat of my spirit and the hand of the lord was strong on me
 then i came to those who had been taken away as prisoners who were at telabib by the river chebar and i was seated among them full of wonder for seven days
 and at the end of seven days the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man i have made you a watchman for the children of israel so give ear to the word of my mouth and give them word from me of their danger
 when i say to the evil doer death will certainly be your fate and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil doer the danger of his evil way so that he may be safe that same evil man will come to death in his evil doing but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you give the evil doer word of his danger and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way death will overtake him in his evil doing but your life will be safe
 again when an upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil and i put a cause of falling in his way death will overtake him because you have given him no word of his danger death will overtake him in his evil doing and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word and your life will be safe
 and the hand of the lord was on me there and he said get up and go out into the valley and there i will have talk with you
 then i got up and went out into the valley and i saw the glory of the lord resting there as i had seen it by the river chebar and i went down on my face
 then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and he had talk with me and said to me go and keep yourself shut up inside your house
 but see o son of man i will put bands on you prisoning you in them and you will not go out among them
 and i will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them for they are an uncontrolled people
 but when i have talk with you i will make your mouth open and you are to say to them this is what the lord has said let the hearer give ear and as for him who will not let him keep his ears shut for they are an uncontrolled people
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man be a prophet and say these are the words of the lord give a cry aha for the day 
 for the day is near the day of the lord is near a day of cloud it will be the time of the nations
 and a sword will come on egypt and cruel pain will be in ethiopia when they are falling by the sword in egypt and they will take away her wealth and her bases will be broken down
 ethiopia and put and lud and all the mixed people and libya and the children of the land of the cherethites will all be put to death with them by the sword
 this is what the lord has said the supporters of egypt will have a fall and the pride of her power will come down from migdol to syene they will be put to the sword in it says the lord
 and she will be made waste among the countries which have been made waste and her towns will be among the towns which are unpeopled
 and they will be certain that i am the lord when i have put a fire in egypt and all her helpers are broken
 in that day men will go out quickly to take the news causing fear in untroubled ethiopia and bitter pain will come on them as in the day of egypt for see it is coming
 this is what the lord has said i will put an end to great numbers of the people of egypt by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 he and the people with him causing fear among the nations will be sent for the destruction of the land their swords will be let loose against egypt and the land will be full of dead
 and i will make the nile streams dry and will give the land into the hands of evil men causing the land and everything in it to be wasted by the hands of men from a strange country i the lord have said it
 this is what the lord has said in addition to this i will give up the images to destruction and put an end to the false gods in noph never again will there be a ruler in the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt
 and i will make pathros a waste and put a fire in zoan and send my punishments on no
