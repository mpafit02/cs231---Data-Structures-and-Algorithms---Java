 go and say in the ears of jerusalem the lord says i still keep the memory of your kind heart when you were young and your love when you became my bride how you went after me in the waste of sand in an unplanted land
 israel was holy to the lord the first fruits of his increase all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers evil came on them says the lord
 give ear to the words of the lord o sons of jacob and all the families of israel
 these are the words of the lord what evil have your fathers seen in me that they have gone far from me and walking after what is false have become false
 and they never said where is the lord who took us up out of the land of egypt who was our guide through the waste of sand through an unplanted land full of deep holes through a dry land of deep shade which no one went through and where no man was living
 and i took you into a fertile land where you were living on its fruit and its wealth but when you came in you made my land unclean and made my heritage a disgusting thing
 the priests did not say where is the lord and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me and the rulers did evil against me and the prophets became prophets of the baal going after things without value
 for this reason i will again put forward my cause against you says the lord even against you and against your childrens children
 for go over to the sea lands of kittim and see send to kedar and give deep thought to it and see if there has ever been such a thing
 has any nation ever made a change in their gods though they are no gods but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit
 be full of wonder o heavens at this be overcome with fear be completely waste says the lord
 for my people have done two evils they have given up me the fountain of living waters and have made for themselves water holes cut out from the rock broken water holes of no use for storing water
 is israel a servant has he been a house servant from birth why has he been made waste
 the young lions have made an outcry against him with a loud voice they have made his land waste his towns are burned up with no one living in them
 even the children of noph and tahpanhes have put shame on you
 has not this come on you because you have given up the lord your god who was your guide by the way
 and now what have you to do on the way to egypt to get your drink from the waters of the nile or what have you to do on the way to assyria to get your drink from the waters of the river
 the evil you yourselves have done will be your punishment your errors will be your judge be certain then and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing to give up the lord your god and no longer to be moved by fear of me says the lord the lord of armies
 for in the past your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted and you said i will not be your servant for on every high hill and under every branching tree your behaviour was like that of a loose woman
 but when you were planted by me you were a noble vine in every way a true seed how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine
 for even if you are washed with soda and take much soap still your evil doing is marked before me says the lord god
 how are you able to say i am not unclean i have not gone after the baals see your way in the valley be clear about what you have done you are a quick footed camel twisting her way in and out
 an untrained ass used to the waste land breathing up the wind in her desire at her time who is able to send her away all those who are looking for her will have no need to make themselves tired in her month they will get her
 do not let your foot be without shoes or your throat dry from need of water but you said there is no hope no for i have been a lover of strange gods and after them i will go
 as the thief is shamed when he is taken so is israel shamed they their kings and their rulers their priests and their prophets
 who say to a tree you are my father and to a stone you have given me life for their backs have been turned to me not their faces but in the time of their trouble they will say up  and be our saviour
 but where are the gods you have made for yourselves let them come if they are able to give you salvation in the time of your trouble for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns o judah
 why will you put forward your cause against me you have all done evil against me says the lord
 i gave your children blows to no purpose they got no good from training your sword has been the destruction of your prophets like a death giving lion
 o generation see the word of the lord have i been a waste land to israel or a land of dark night why do my people say we have got loose we will not come to you again
