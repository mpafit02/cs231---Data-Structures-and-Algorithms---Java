 so they took the vessels of the people and their horns from their hands and he sent them away every man to his tent keeping only the three hundred and the tents of midian were lower down in the valley
 the same night the lord said to him up  go down now against their army for i have given them into your hands
 but if you have fear of going down take your servant purah with you and go down to the tents
 and after hearing what they are saying you will get strength to go down against the army so he went down with his servant purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men
 now the midianites and the amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts and their camels were like the sand by the seaside without number
 when gideon came there a man was giving his friend an account of his dream saying see i had a dream about a cake of barley bread which falling into the tents of midian came on to the tent overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the earth
 and his friend in answer said this is certainly the sword of gideon the son of joash the men of israel into their hands god has given up all the army of midian
 then gideon hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it gave worship then he went back to the tents of israel and said up  for the lord has given the army of midian into your hands
 then separating the three hundred men into three bands he gave every man a horn and a vessel in which was a flaming branch
 and he said to them keep your eyes on me and do what i do when i come to the outer line of tents whatever i do you are to do the same
 at the sound of my horn and the horns of those who are with me let your horns be sounded all round the tents and say for the lord and for gideon
 so gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents at the start of the middle watch when the watchmen had only then taken their stations and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken
 so the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns and when the vessels had been broken they took the flaming branches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing crying out for the lord and for gideon
 then they made a line round the tents every man in his place and all the army awaking from sleep came running out and with loud cries went in flight
 and the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns and every mans sword was turned by the lord against his brother all through the army and the army went in flight as far as beth shittah in the direction of zeredah to the edge of abel meholah by tabbath
 and the men of israel came together from naphtali and from asher and all manasseh and went after midian
 then gideon sent through all the hill country of ephraim saying come down against midian and keep the ways across jordan before they come so all the men of ephraim massing themselves together kept the ways across jordan
 and they took the two chiefs of midian oreb and zeeb and they put oreb to death at the rock of oreb and zeeb they put to death at the place of the grape crushing in zeeb and they went after midian but the heads of oreb and zeeb they took across jordan to gideon
 and the men of ephraim came and said to him why did you not send for us when you went to war against midian and they said sharp and angry words to him
 and he said to them what have i done in comparison with you is not that which ephraim took up after the grape cutting better than all the grapes which abiezer got in from the grape cutting
 god has given into your hands the chiefs of midian oreb and zeeb what have i been able to do in comparison with you and when he said this their feeling about him became kinder
 then gideon came to jordan and went over it with his three hundred overcome with weariness and in need of food
 and he said to the men of succoth give bread cakes to my people for they are overcome with weariness and i am going on after zebah and zalmunna the kings of midian
 but the chiefs of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army
 then gideon said because of this when the lord has given zebah and zalmunna into my hands i will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain floor
 so he went up from there to penuel and made the same request to the men of penuel but they gave him the same answer as the men of succoth had given
 so he said to the men of penuel when i come back in peace i will have this tower broken down
 now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their armies with them about fifteen thousand men those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death
 and gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger
 and zebah and zalmunna went in flight and he went after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and put all the army to the curse
