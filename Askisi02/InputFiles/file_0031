 so it is right for us to take in such men as guests so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith
 i sent a letter to the church but diotrephes whose desire is ever to have the first place among them will not have us there
 so if i come i will keep in mind the things he does talking against us with evil words and as if this was not enough he does not take the brothers into his house and those who are ready to take them in he keeps from doing so putting them out of the church if they do
 my loved one do not be copying what is evil but what is good he who does good is of god he who does evil has not seen god
 demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true and we give the same witness and you are certain that our witness is true
 i had much to say to you but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen
 but i am hoping to see you in a short time and to have talk with you face to face 
 may you have peace your friends here send you their love give my love to our friends by name
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and timothy the brother to the church of god which is in corinth with all the saints who are in all achaia
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort
 who gives us comfort in all our troubles so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god
 for as we undergo more of the pain which christ underwent so through christ does our comfort become greater
 but if we are troubled it is for your comfort and salvation or if we are comforted it is for your comfort which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo
 and our hope for you is certain in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles so you will take part in the comfort
 for it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in asia that the weight of it was very great more than our power so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life
 yes we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves so that our hope might not be in ourselves but in god who is able to give life to the dead
 who gave us salvation from so great a death on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation
 you at the same time helping together by your prayer for us so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons praise may go up to god for us from all of them
 for our glory is in this in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world and most of all in relation to you has been holy and true in the eyes of god not in the wisdom of the flesh but in the grace of god
 for in our letters we say no other things to you but those which you are reading and to which you give agreement and it is my hope will go on doing so to the end
 even as you have been ready in part to say that we are your glory in the same way that you are ours in the day of the lord jesus
 and being certain of this it was my purpose to come to you before so that you might have a second grace
 and by way of corinth to go into macedonia and from there to come back again to you so that you might send me on my way to judaea
 if then i had such a purpose did i seem to be changing suddenly or am i guided in my purposes by the flesh saying yes today and no tomorrow
 as god is true our word to you is not yes and no
 for the son of god jesus christ whom we were preaching among you even i and silvanus and timothy was not yes and no but in him is yes
 for he is the yes to all the undertakings of god and by him all the words of god are made certain and put into effect to the glory of god through us
 now he who makes our faith strong together with you in christ and has given us of his grace is god
 and it is he who has put his stamp on us even the spirit as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory
