 the lord gives help to the poor in spirit but he sends sinners down in shame
 make songs of praise to the lord make melody to our god with instruments of music
 by his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth he makes the grass tall on the mountains
 he gives food to every beast and to the young ravens in answer to their cry
 he has no delight in the strength of a horse he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man
 the lord takes pleasure in his worshippers and in those whose hope is in his mercy
 give praise to the lord o jerusalem give praise to your god o zion
 he has made strong the iron bands of your doors he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls
 he gives peace in all your land making your stores full of fat grain
 he sends out his orders to the earth his word goes out quickly
 he gives snow like wool he sends out ice drops like dust
 he sends down ice like raindrops water is made hard by his cold
 at the outgoing of his word the ice is turned to water when he sends out his wind there is a flowing of waters
 he makes his word clear to jacob teaching israel his laws and his decisions
 he has not done these things for any other nation and as for his laws they have no knowledge of them let the lord be praised
 give praise to the lord let the lord be praised from the heavens give him praise in the skies
 give praise to him all you his angels give praise to him all his armies
 give praise to him you sun and moon give praise to him all you stars of light
 give praise to him you highest heavens and you waters which are over the heavens
 let them give praise to the name of the lord for he gave the order and they were made
 he has put them in their places for ever he has given them their limits which may not be broken
 give praise to the lord from the earth you great sea beasts and deep places
 fire and rain of ice snow and mists storm wind doing his word
 mountains and all hills fruit trees and all trees of the mountains
 beasts and all cattle insects and winged birds
 kings of the earth and all peoples rulers and all judges of the earth
 young men and virgins old men and children
 let them give glory to the name of the lord for his name only is to be praised his kingdom is over the earth and the heaven
 he has put on high the horn of his people for the praise of all his saints even the children of israel a people which is near to him let the lord be praised
 let the lord be praised make a new song to the lord let his praise be in the meeting of his saints
