 and of naphtali a thousand captains with thirty seven thousand spearmen
 and of the danites twenty eight thousand six hundred expert in ordering the fight
 and of asher forty thousand who went out with the army expert in ordering the fight
 from the other side of jordan there were a hundred and twenty thousand of the reubenites and the gadites and the men of the half tribe of manasseh armed with every sort of instrument of war
 all these men of war expert in ordering the fight came to hebron with the full purpose of making david king over all israel and all the rest of israel were united in their desire to make david king
 for three days they were there with david feasting at his table for their brothers had made ready food for them
 and those who were near as far as issachar and zebulun and naphtali came with food on asses and camels and mules and oxen with meal for food and cakes of figs and masses of grapes and wine and oil and oxen and sheep in great numbers for there was joy in israel
 then david had discussions with the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and with every chief
 and david said to all the men of israel who had come together there if it seems good to you and if it is the purpose of the lord our god let us send to all the rest of our brothers everywhere in the land of israel and to the priests and the levites in their towns and the country round them and get them to come together here to us
 and let us get back for ourselves the ark of our god for in the days of saul we did not go to it for directions
 and all the people said they would do so for it seemed right to them
 so david sent for all israel to come together from shihor the river of egypt as far as the way into hamath to get the ark of god from kiriath jearim
 and david went up with all israel to baalah that is to kiriath jearim in judah to get up from there the ark of god over which the holy name is named the name of the lord whose place is between the winged ones
 and they put the ark of god on a new cart and took it out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio were the drivers of the cart
 then david and all israel made melody before god with all their strength with songs and corded instruments of music and with brass instruments and horns
 and when they came to the grain floor of chidon uzza put out his hand to keep the ark in its place for the oxen were slipping
 and the wrath of the lord burning against uzza sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there before god
 and david was angry because of the lords outburst of wrath against uzza and he gave that place the name perez uzza to this day
 and so great was davids fear of god that day that he said how may i let the ark of god come to me
 so david did not let the ark come back to him to the town of david but had it turned away and put into the house of obed edom the gittite
 and the ark of god was in the house of obed edom for three months and the lord sent a blessing on the house of obed edom and on all he had
 and hiram king of tyre sent men to david with cedar trees and stoneworkers and woodworkers for the building of his house
 and david saw that the lord had made his position safe as king over israel lifting up his kingdom on high because of his people israel
 and while he was living in jerusalem david took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters
 these are the names of the children he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon
 and ibhar and elishua and elpelet
 and nogah and nepheg and japhia
 and elishama and beeliada and eliphelet
 and when the philistines had news that david had been made king over all israel they went up in search of david and david hearing of it went out against them
 now the philistines had come and had gone out in every direction in the valley of rephaim
