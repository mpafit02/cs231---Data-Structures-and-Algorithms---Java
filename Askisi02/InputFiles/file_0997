 in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my safe place
 have faith in him at all times you people let your hearts go flowing out before him god is our safe place  selah 
 truly men of low birth are nothing and men of high position are not what they seem if they are put in the scales together they are less than a breath
 have no faith in the rewards of evil doing or in profits wrongly made if your wealth is increased do not put your hopes on it
 once has god said twice has it come to my ears that power is gods
 and mercy o lord is yours for you give to every man the reward of his work
 &lta psalm of david when he was in the waste land of judah&gt o god you are my god early will i make my search for you my soul is dry for need of you my flesh is wasted with desire for you as a dry and burning land where no water is
 to see your power and your glory as i have seen you in the holy place
 because your mercy is better than life my lips will give you praise
 so will i go on blessing you all my life lifting up my hands in your name
 my soul will be comforted as with good food and my mouth will give you praise with songs of joy
 when the memory of you comes to me on my bed and when i give thought to you in the night time
 because you have been my help i will have joy in the shade of your wings
 my soul keeps ever near you your right hand is my support
 but those whose desire is my souls destruction will go down to the lower parts of the earth
 they will be cut off by the sword they will be food for foxes
 but the king will have joy in god everyone who takes an oath by him will have cause for pride but the false mouth will be stopped
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt o god let the voice of my grief come to your ear keep my life from the fear of those who are against me
 keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers from the band of the workers of evil
 who make their tongues sharp like a sword and whose arrows are pointed even bitter words
 so that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright suddenly and unseen
 they make themselves strong in an evil purpose they make holes for secret nets they say who will see it
 or make discovery of our secret purpose the design is framed with care and the inner thought of a man and his heart is deep
 but god sends out an arrow against them suddenly they are wounded
 the evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall all those who see them are shaking their heads at them
 and in fear men make public the works of god and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom
 the upright will be glad in the lord and have hope in him and all the lovers of righteousness will give him glory
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david a song&gt it is right for you o god to have praise in zion to you let the offering be made
 to you o hearer of prayer let the words of all flesh come
 evils have overcome us but as for our sins you will take them away
