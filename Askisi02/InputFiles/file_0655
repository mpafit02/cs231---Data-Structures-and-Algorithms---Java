 now go put it in writing before them on a board and make a record of it in a book so that it may be for the future a witness for all time to come
 for they are an uncontrolled people false hearted who will not give ear to the teaching of the lord
 who say to the seers see not and to the prophets do not give us word of what is true but say false things to give us pleasure
 get out of the good way turning from the right road do not keep the holy one of israel before our minds
 for this cause the holy one of israel says because you will not give ear to this word and are looking for help in ways of deceit and evil and are putting your hope in them
 this sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall causing its fall suddenly and in a minute
 and he will let it be broken as a potters vessel is broken it will be smashed to bits without mercy so that there will not be a bit in which one may take fire from the fireplace or water from the spring
 for the lord the holy one of israel said in quiet and rest is your salvation peace and hope are your strength but you would not have it so
 saying no for we will go in flight on horses so you will certainly go in flight and we will go on the backs of quick running beasts so those who go after you will be quick footed
 a thousand will go in fear before one even before five you will go in flight till you are like a pillar by itself on the top of a mountain and like a flag on a hill
 for this cause the lord will be waiting so that he may be kind to you and he will be lifted up so that he may have mercy on you for the lord is a god of righteousness there is a blessing on all whose hope is in him
 o people living in zion at jerusalem your weeping will be ended he will certainly have mercy on you at the sound of your cry when it comes to his ear he will give you an answer
 and though the lord will give you the bread of trouble and the water of grief you will no longer put your teacher on one side but you will see your teacher
 and at your back when you are turning to the right hand or to the left a voice will be sounding in your ears saying this is the way in which you are to go
 and you will make unclean what is covering your pictured images of silver and the plating of your images of gold you will send them away as an unclean thing saying be gone 
 and he will give rain for your seed so that you may put it in the earth and you will have bread from the produce of the earth good and more than enough for your needs in that day the cattle will get their food in wide grass lands
 and the oxen and the young asses which are used for ploughing will have salted grain which has been made free from the waste with fork and basket
 and there will be rivers and streams of water on every tall mountain and on every high hill in the day when great numbers are put to the sword when the towers come down
 and the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be seven times greater as the light of seven days in the day when the lord puts oil on the wounds of his people and makes them well from the blows they have undergone
 see the name of the lord is coming from far burning with his wrath with thick smoke going up his lips are full of passion and his tongue is like a burning fire
 and his breath is as an overflowing stream coming up even to the neck shaking the nations for their destruction like the shaking of grain in a basket and he will put a cord in the mouths of the people turning them out of their way
 you will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and you will be glad in heart as when they go with music of the pipe to the mountain of the lord the rock of israel
 and the lord will send out the sound of his great voice and they will see his arm stretched out with the heat of his wrath and the flame of a burning fire with a cloud burst and storm and a rain of ice
 for through the voice of the lord the assyrian will be broken and the lords rod will be lifted up against him
 and every blow of the rod of his punishment which the lord will send on him will be with the sound of music and with the waving of his sword the lord will make war against him
 for a place of fire has long been ready yes it has been made ready for the king he has made it deep and wide it is massed with fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of fire puts a light to it
 cursed are those who go down to egypt for help and who put their faith in horses looking to war carriages for salvation because of their numbers and to horsemen because they are very strong but they are not looking to the holy one of israel or turning their hearts to the lord
 though he is wise and able to send evil and his purpose will not be changed but he will go against the house of the evil doers and against those to whom they are looking for help
 for the egyptians are men and not god and their horses are flesh and not spirit and when the lords hand is stretched out the helper and he who is helped will come down together
 for the lord has said to me as a lion or a young lion makes an angry noise over his food and if a band of herdsmen come out against him he will not be in fear of their voices or give up his food for their noise so the lord of armies will come down to make war against mount zion and its hill
