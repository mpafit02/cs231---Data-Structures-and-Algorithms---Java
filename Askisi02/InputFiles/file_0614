 and the captain put them in josephs care and he did what was needed for them and they were kept in prison for some time
 and these two had a dream on the same night the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker of the king of egypt who were in prison the two of them had dreams with a special sense
 and in the morning when joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad
 and he said to the servants of pharaoh who were in prison with him why are you looking so sad
 then they said to him we have had a dream and no one is able to give us the sense and joseph said does not the sense of dreams come from god what was your dream
 then the chief wine servant gave joseph an account of his dream and said in my dream i saw a vine before me
 and on the vine were three branches and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers and from them came grapes ready for cutting
 and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and crushing them into pharaohs cup gave the cup into pharaohs hand
 then joseph said this is the sense of your dream the three branches are three days
 after three days pharaoh will give you honour and put you back into your place and you will give him his cup as you did before when you were his wine servant
 but keep me in mind when things go well for you and be good to me and say a good word for me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison
 for truly i was taken by force from the land of the hebrews and i have done nothing for which i might be put in prison
 now when the chief bread maker saw that the first dream had a good sense he said to joseph i had a dream and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head
 and in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for pharaoh and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head
 then joseph said this is the sense of your dream the three baskets are three days
 after three days pharaoh will take you out of prison hanging you on a tree so that your flesh will be food for birds
 now the third day was pharaohs birthday and he gave a feast for all his servants and he gave honour to the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker among the others
 and he put the chief wine servant back in his old place and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand
 but the chief bread maker was put to death by hanging as joseph had said
 but the wine servant did not keep joseph in mind or give a thought to him
 now after two years had gone by pharaoh had a dream and in his dream he was by the side of the nile
 and out of the nile came seven cows good looking and fat and their food was the river grass
 and after them seven other cows came out of the nile poor looking and thin and they were by the side of the other cows
 and the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows then pharaoh came out of his sleep
 but he went to sleep again and had a second dream in which he saw seven heads of grain full and good all on one stem
 and after them came up seven other heads thin and wasted by the east wind
 and the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads and when pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream
 and in the morning his spirit was troubled and he sent for all the wise men of egypt and all the holy men and put his dream before them but no one was able to give him the sense of it
 then the chief wine servant said to pharaoh the memory of my sin comes back to me now
 pharaoh had been angry with his servants and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army together with the chief bread maker
