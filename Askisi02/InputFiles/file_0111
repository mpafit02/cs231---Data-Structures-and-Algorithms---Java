 so that the words of the prophet isaiah might come true when he said lord who has any belief in our preaching and the arm of the lord to whom has it been unveiled
 for this reason they were unable to have belief because isaiah said again
 he has made their eyes blind and their hearts hard for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts and be changed and i might make them well
  isaiah said these words because he saw his glory his words were about him 
 however a number even of the rulers had belief in him but because of the pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the synagogue
 for the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of god
 then jesus said with a loud voice he who has faith in me has faith not in me but in him who sent me
 and he who sees me sees him who sent me
 i have come as a light into the world so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark
 and if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them i am not his judge i did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world
 he who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart is not without a judge the word which i have said will be his judge on the last day
 for i have not said it on my authority but the father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it
 and i have knowledge that his order is eternal life so that the things which i say i say them even as the father says them to me
 now before the feast of the passover it was clear to jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the father having once had love for those in the world who were his his love for them went on to the end
 so while a meal was going on the evil one having now put it into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to be false to him
 jesus being conscious that the father had put everything into his hands and that he came from god and was going to god
 got up from table put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him
 then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him
 so he came to simon peter peter said lord are my feet to be washed by you
 and jesus answering said to him what i do is not clear to you now but it will be clear to you in time to come
 peter said i will never let my feet be washed by you never jesus said in answer if i do not make you clean you have no part with me
 simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but my hands and my head
 jesus said to him he who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over and you my disciples are clean but not all of you
  he had knowledge who was false to him that is why he said you are not all clean 
 then after washing their feet and putting on his robe again he took his seat and said to them do you see what i have done to you
 you give me the name of master and lord and you are right that is what i am
 if then i the lord and the master have made your feet clean it is right for you to make one anothers feet clean
 i have given you an example so that you may do what i have done to you
 truly i say to you a servant is not greater than his lord and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him
 if these things are clear to you happy are you if you do them
