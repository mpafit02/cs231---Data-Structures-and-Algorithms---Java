 god is spirit then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit
 the woman said to him i am certain that the messiah who is named christ is coming when he comes he will make all things clear to us
 jesus said to her i who am talking to you am he
 at that point the disciples came back and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman but not one of them said to him what is your purpose or why are you talking to her
 then the woman put down her water pot and went into the town and said to the people
 come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything i ever did  is it possible that this is the christ
 so they went out of the town and came to him
 while this was taking place the disciples were saying to jesus master take some food
 but he said to them i have food of which you have no knowledge
 so the disciples said one to another did anyone give him food
 jesus said my food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete
 you would say four months from now is the time of the grain cutting take a look i say to you at the fields they are even now white for cutting
 he who does the cutting now has his reward he is getting together fruit for eternal life so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together
 in this the saying is a true one one does the planting and another gets in the grain
 i sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting other men did that work and you take the reward
 now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the womans witness he has been talking to me of everything i ever did
 so when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time and he was there two days
 and a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said
 and they said to the woman now we have faith but not because of your story we ourselves have given ear to his words and we are certain that he is truly the saviour of the world
 and after the two days he went on from there into galilee
 for jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth
 so when he came into galilee the galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in jerusalem at the feast  they themselves having been there at the feast
 so he came to cana in galilee where he had made the water wine and there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at capernaum
 when it came to his ears that jesus had come from judaea into galilee he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son who was near to death and make him well
 then jesus said to him you will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders
 the man said sir come down before my boy is dead
 and jesus said go in peace your son is living the man had faith in the word which jesus said to him and went away
 and while he was going down his servants came to him and said your boy is living
 so he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better and they said to him the disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour
 it was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which jesus said to him your son is living and he had faith in jesus he and all his family
