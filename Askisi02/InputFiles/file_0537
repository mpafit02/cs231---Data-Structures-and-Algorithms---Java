 and he said to me son of man get up on your feet so that i may say words to you
 and at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and his voice came to my ears
 and he said to me son of man i am sending you to the children of israel to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day
 and the children are hard and stiff hearted i am sending you to them and you are to say to them these are the words of the lord
 and they if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear  for they are an uncontrolled people  will see that there has been a prophet among them
 and you son of man have no fear of them or of their words even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
 and you are to give them my words if they give ear to you or if they do not for they are uncontrolled
 but you son of man give ear to what i say to you and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people let your mouth be open and take what i give you
 and looking i saw a hand stretched out to me and i saw the roll of a book in it
 and he put it open before me and it had writing on the front and on the back words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it
 now it came about in the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month that certain of the responsible men of israel came to get directions from the lord and were seated before me
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say to the responsible men of israel this is what the lord has said have you come to get directions from me by my life says the lord you will get no directions from me
 will you be their judge o son of man will you be their judge make clear to them the disgusting ways of their fathers
 and say to them this is what the lord has said in the day when i took israel for myself when i made an oath to the seed of the family of jacob and i gave them knowledge of myself in the land of egypt saying to them with an oath i am the lord your god
 in that day i gave my oath to take them out of the land of egypt into a land which i had been searching out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
 and i said to them let every man among you put away the disgusting things to which his eyes are turned and do not make yourselves unclean with the images of egypt i am the lord your god
 but they would not be controlled by me and did not give ear to me they did not put away the disgusting things to which their eyes were turned or give up the images of egypt then i said i would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the land of egypt
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean before the eyes of the nations among whom they were and before whose eyes i gave them knowledge of myself by taking them out of the land of egypt
 so i made them go out of the land of egypt and took them into the waste land
 and i gave them my rules and made clear to them my orders which if a man keeps them will be life to him
 and further i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them so that it might be clear that i who make them holy am the lord
 but the children of israel would not be controlled by me in the waste land they were not guided by my rules and they were turned away from my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my sabbaths then i said that i would let loose my passion on them in the waste land and put an end to them
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes i had taken them out
 and further i gave my oath to them in the waste land that i would not take them into the land which i had given them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
 because they were turned away from my orders and were not guided by my rules and had no respect for my sabbaths for their hearts went after their images
 but still my eye had pity on them and i kept them from destruction and did not put an end to them completely in the waste land
 and i said to their children in the waste land do not be guided by the rules of your fathers or keep their orders or make yourselves unclean with their images
 i am the lord your god be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them
 and keep my sabbaths holy and they will be a sign between me and you so that it may be clear to you that i am the lord your god
