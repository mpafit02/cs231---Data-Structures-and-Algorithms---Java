 what man is there who will not have fear before you o lord and give glory to your name because you only are holy for all the nations will come and give worship before you for your righteousness has been made clear
 and after these things i saw and the house of the tent of witness in heaven was open
 and the seven angels who had the seven punishments came out from the house of god clothed with linen clean and bright and with bands of gold about their breasts
 and one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven gold vessels full of the wrath of god who is living for ever and ever
 and the house of god was full of smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one was able to go into the house of god till the seven punishments of the seven angels were ended
 and a great voice out of the house of god came to my ears saying to the seven angels go and let that which is in the seven vessels of the wrath of god come down on the earth
 and the first went and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image
 and the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living thing in the sea came to an end
 and the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water and they became blood
 and the voice of the angel of the waters came to my ears saying true and upright is your judging o holy one who is and was from all time
 for they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream and blood have you given them for drink which is their right reward
 and a voice came from the altar saying even so o lord god ruler of all true and full of righteousness is your judging
 and the fourth let what was in his vessel come out on the sun and power was given to it that men might be burned with fire
 and men were burned with great heat and they said evil things against the name of the god who has authority over these punishments and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory
 and the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast and his kingdom was made dark and they were biting their tongues for pain
 and they said evil things against the god of heaven because of their pain and their wounds and they were not turned from their evil works
 and the sixth let what was in his vessel come out on the great river euphrates and it became dry so that the way might be made ready for the kings from the east
 and i saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs
 for they are evil spirits working signs who go out even to the kings of all the earth to get them together to the war of the great day of god the ruler of all
  see i come as a thief happy is he who is watching and keeps his robes so that he may not go unclothed and his shame be seen 
 and they got them together into the place which is named in hebrew armageddon
 and the seventh let what was in his vessel come out on the air and there came out a great voice from the house of god from the high seat saying it is done
 and there were flames and voices and thunders and there was a great earth shock so that never from the time when men were on the earth had there been so great an earth shock so full of power
 and the great town was cut into three parts and the towns of the nations came to destruction and babylon the great came into mind before god to be given the cup of the wine of his wrath
 and every island went in flight and the mountains were seen no longer
 and great drops of ice every one about the weight of a talent came down out of heaven on men and men said evil things against god because of the punishment of the ice drops for it is very great
 and one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels came and said to me come here so that you may see the judging of the evil woman who is seated on the great waters
 with whom the kings of the earth made themselves unclean and those who are on the earth were full of the wine of her evil desires
 and he took me away in the spirit into a waste land and i saw a woman seated on a bright red beast full of evil names having seven heads and ten horns
 and the woman was clothed in purple and bright red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels and in her hand was a gold cup full of evil things and her unclean desires
