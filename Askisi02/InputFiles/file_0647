 and he will be the judge between the nations and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions and their swords will be turned into plough blades and their spears into vine knives no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever
 o family of jacob come and let us go in the light of the lord
 for you o lord have given up your people the family of jacob because they are full of the evil ways of the east and make use of secret arts like the philistines and are friends with the children of strange countries
 and their land is full of silver and gold and there is no end to their stores their land is full of horses and there is no end to their carriages
 their land is full of images they give worship to the work of their hands even to that which their fingers have made
 and the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin
 go into a hole in the rock covering yourselves with dust in fear of the lord before the glory of his power
 the high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the lord will be lifted up in that day
 for the day of the lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men and on all who are high and lifted up
 and on all the high trees of lebanon and on all the strong trees of bashan
 and on all the high mountains and on all the hills which are lifted up
 and on every high tower and on every strong wall
 and on all the ships of tarshish and on all the fair boats
 and the high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the lord will be lifted up in that day
 and the images will never be seen again
 and men will go into cracks of the rocks and into holes of the earth for fear of the lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
 in that day men will put their images of silver and of gold which they made for worship in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places
 to take cover in the cracks of the rocks and in the holes of the hills for fear of the lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
 have no more to do with man whose life is only a breath for he is of no value
 in the year when the tartan came to ashdod sent by sargon king of assyria and made war against it and took it
 at that time the word of the lord came to isaiah the son of amoz saying go and take off your robe and your shoes from your feet and he did so walking unclothed and without shoes on his feet
 and the lord said as my servant isaiah has gone unclothed and without shoes for three years as a sign and a wonder to egypt and ethiopia
 so will the king of assyria take away the prisoners of egypt and those forced out of ethiopia young and old unclothed and without shoes and with backs uncovered to the shame of egypt
 and they will be full of fear and will no longer have faith in ethiopia which was their hope or in egypt which was their glory
 and those living by the sea will say in that day see the fate of our hope to whom we went for help and salvation from the king of assyria what hope have we then of salvation
 the word about the waste land as storm winds in the south go rushing through it comes from the waste land from the land greatly to be feared
 a vision of fear comes before my eyes the worker of deceit goes on in his false way and the waster goes on making waste up  elam to the attack  media i have put an end to her sorrow
 for this cause i am full of bitter grief pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me i am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears i am shocked by what i see
 my mind is wandering fear has overcome me the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me
 they make ready the table they put down the covers they take food and drink up  you captains put oil on your breastplates
