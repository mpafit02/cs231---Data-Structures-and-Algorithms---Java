 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 say now to this uncontrolled people are these things not clear to you say to them see the king of babylon came to jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to babylon
 and he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him and he put him under an oath and took away the great men of the land
 so that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up but might keep his agreement to be his servants
 but he went against his authority in sending representatives to egypt to get from them horses and a great army will he do well will he be safe who does such things if the agreement is broken will he be safe
 by my life says the lord truly in the place of the king who made him king whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken even in babylon he will come to his death
 and pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives
 for he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken and though he had given his hand to it he did all these things he will not get away safe
 and so the lord has said by my life truly for my oath which he put on one side and my agreement which has been broken i will send punishment on his head
 my net will be stretched out over him and he will be taken in my cords and i will send him to babylon and there i will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me
 all his best fighting men will be put to the sword and the rest will be sent away to every wind and you will be certain that i the lord have said it
 this is what the lord has said further i will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one i will have it planted on a high and great mountain
 it will be planted on the high mountain of israel it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar under it all birds of every sort will make their living place resting in the shade of its branches
 and it will be clear to all the trees of the field that i the lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth i the lord have said it and have done it
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 why do you make use of this saying about the land of israel the fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are on edge
 by my life says the lord you will no longer have this saying in israel
 see all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son is mine death will be the fate of the sinners soul
 but if a man is upright living rightly and doing righteousness
 and has not taken flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of israel if he has not had connection with his neighbours wife or come near to a woman at the time when she is unclean
 and has done no wrong to any but has given back to the debtor what is his and has taken no ones goods by force and has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
 and has not given his money out at interest or taken great profits and turning his hand from evil doing has kept faith between man and man
 and has been guided by my rules and has kept my laws and done them he is upright life will certainly be his says the lord
 if he has a son who is a thief a taker of life who does any of these things
 who has taken flesh with the blood as food and has had connection with his neighbours wife
 has done wrong to the poor and to him who is in need and taken property by force and has not given back to one in his debt what is his and has given worship to images and has done disgusting things
 and has given out his money at interest and taken great profits he will certainly not go on living he has done all these disgusting things death will certainly be his fate his blood will be on him
 now if he has a son who sees all his fathers sins which he has done and in fear does not do the same
 who has not taken the flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of israel and has not had connection with his neighbours wife
 or done wrong to any or taken anything from one in his debt or taken goods by force but has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
