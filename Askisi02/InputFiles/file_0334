 and saul said then say to david the king has no desire for any bride price but only for the private parts of a hundred philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters but it was in sauls mind that david might come to his end by the hands of the philistines
 and when his servants said these words to david he was well pleased to be the son in law of the king and the days were still not past
 so david and his men got up and went and put to death two hundred of the philistines and david took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king so that he might be the kings son in law and saul gave him his daughter michal for his wife
 and it was clear to saul that the lord was with david and he was loved by all israel
 and sauls fear of david became all the greater and he went on hating him day by day
 then the rulers of the philistines went out to war and whenever they went out david did more wisely than all the other servants of saul so that his name became greatly honoured
 and saul gave orders to his son jonathan and to all his servants to put david to death but sauls son jonathan had great delight in david
 and jonathan said to david saul my father is purposing your death so now take care in the morning and keep yourself safe in a secret place
 and i will go out and take my place by my fathers side in the field near where you are and i will get into talk with my father about you and when i see how things are i will give you word
 and jonathan gave his father saul a good account of david and said to him let not the king do wrong against his servant against david because he has done you no wrong and all his acts have had a good outcome for you
 for he put his life in danger and overcame the philistine and the lord gave all israel salvation you saw it and were glad why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong desiring the death of david without cause
 and saul gave ear to the voice of jonathan and said with an oath by the living lord he is not to be put to death
 then jonathan sent for david and gave him word of all these things and jonathan took david to saul who kept him by his side as in the past
 and there was war again and david went out fighting the philistines causing great destruction among them and they went in flight before him
 and an evil spirit from the lord came on saul when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand and david made music for him
 and saul would have sent his spear through him pinning him to the wall but he got away and the spear went into the wall and that night david went in flight and got away
 then in that night saul sent men to davids house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning and davids wife michal said to him if you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning
 so michal let david down through the window and he went in flight and got away
 then michal took the image and put it in the bed with a cushion of goats hair at its head and she put clothing over it
 and when saul sent men to take david she said he is ill
 and saul sent his men to see david saying do not come back without him take him in his bed so that i may put him to death
 and when the men came in there was the image in the bed with the cushion of goats hair at its head
 and saul said to michal why have you been false to me letting my hater go and get safely away and in answer michal said to saul he said to me let me go or i will put you to death
 so david went in flight and got away and came to ramah to samuel and gave him an account of all saul had done to him and he and samuel went and were living in naioth
 and word was given to saul that david was at naioth in ramah
 and saul sent men to take david and when they saw the band of prophets at work with samuel in his place at their head the spirit of god came on sauls men and they became like prophets
 and saul having news of this sent other men who in the same way became like prophets and a third time saul sent men and they like the others became like prophets
 then he himself went to ramah and came to the great water spring in secu and questioning the people he said where are samuel and david and one said they are at naioth in ramah
 and he went on from there to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god came on him and he went on acting like a prophet till he came to naioth in ramah
 and he took off his clothing acting like a prophet before samuel and falling down he was stretched out without his clothing all that day and all that night this is the reason for the saying is even saul among the prophets
