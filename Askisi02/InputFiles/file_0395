 and he sent to jehoshaphat king of judah saying the king of moab has got free from my authority will you go with me to make war on moab and he said i will go with you i am as you are my people as your people and my horses as your horses
 and he said which way are we to go and he said in answer by the waste land of edom
 so the king of israel went with the king of judah and the king of edom by a roundabout way for seven days and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them
 and the king of israel said here is trouble for the lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of moab
 but jehoshaphat said is there no prophet of the lord here through whom we may get directions from the lord and one of the king of israels men said in answer elisha the son of shaphat is here who was servant to elijah
 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him
 but elisha said to the king of israel what have i to do with you go to the prophets of your father and your mother and the king of israel said no for the lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of moab
 then elisha said by the life of the lord of armies whose servant i am if it was not for the respect i have for jehoshaphat king of judah i would not give a look at you or see you
 but now get me a player of music and it will come about that while the man is playing the hand of the lord will come on me and i will give you the word of the lord and they got a player of music and while the man was playing the hand of the lord was on him
 and he said the lord says i will make this valley full of water holes
 for the lord says though you see no wind or rain the valley will be full of water and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink
 and this will be only a small thing to the lord in addition he will give the moabites into your hands
 and you are to put every walled town to destruction cutting down every good tree and stopping up every water spring and making all the good land rough with stones
 now in the morning about the time when the offering was made they saw water flowing from the direction of edom till the country was full of water
 now all moab hearing that the kings had come to make war against them got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country
 and early in the morning they got up when the sun was shining on the water and they saw the water facing them as red as blood
 then they said this is blood it is clear that destruction has come on the kings they have been fighting one another now come moab let us take their goods
 but when they came to the tents of israel the israelites came out and made a violent attack on the moabites so that they went in flight before them and they went forward still attacking them
 pulling down the towns covering every good field with stones stopping up all the water springs and cutting down all the good trees they went on driving moab before them till only in kir hareseth were there any moabites and the fighting men went round the town raining stones on it
 and when the king of moab saw that the fight was going against him he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of aram but they were not able to do so
 then he took his oldest son who would have been king after him offering him as a burned offering on the wall so there was great wrath against israel and they went away from him back to their country
 now a certain woman the wife of one of the sons of the prophets came crying to elisha and said your servant my husband is dead and to your knowledge he was a worshipper of the lord but now the creditor has come to take my two children as servants in payment of his debt
 then elisha said to her what am i to do for you say now what have you in the house and she said your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil
 then he said go out to all your neighbours and get vessels a very great number of them
 then go in and shutting the door on yourself and your sons put oil into all these vessels putting on one side the full ones
 so she went away and when the door was shut on her and her sons they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them
 and when all the vessels were full she said to her son get me another vessel and he said there are no more and the flow of oil was stopped
 so she came to the man of god and gave him word of what she had done and he said go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons
 now there came a day when elisha went to shunem and there was a woman of high position living there who made him come in and have a meal with her and after that every time he went by he went into her house for a meal
 and she said to her husband now i see that this is a holy man of god who comes by day after day
