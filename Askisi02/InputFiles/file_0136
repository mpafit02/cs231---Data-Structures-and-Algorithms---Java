 and mary said to the angel how may this be because i have had no knowledge of a man
 and the angel in answer said to her the holy spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will come to rest on you and so that which will come to birth will be named holy son of god
 even now elisabeth who is of your family is to be a mother though she is old and this is the sixth month with her who was without children
 for there is nothing which god is not able to do
 and mary said i am the servant of the lord may it be to me as you say and the angel went away
 then mary got up and went quickly into the high lands to a town of judah
 and went into the house of zacharias and took elisabeth in her arms
 and when the voice of mary came to the ears of elisabeth the baby made a sudden move inside her then elisabeth was full of the holy spirit
 and she said with a loud voice may blessing be on you among women and a blessing on the child of your body
 how is it that the mother of my lord comes to me
 for truly when the sound of your voice came to my ears the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy
 happy will she be who had faith that the things which the lord has said to her will be done
 and mary said my soul gives glory to god
 my spirit is glad in god my saviour
 for he has had pity on his servant though she is poor and lowly placed and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me
 for he who is strong has done great things for me and holy is his name
 his mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him
 with his arm he has done acts of power he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts
 he has put down kings from their seats lifting up on high the men of low degree
 those who had no food he made full of good things the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands
 his help he has given to israel his servant so that he might keep in mind his mercy to abraham and his seed for ever
 as he gave his word to our fathers
 and mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house
 now it was time for elisabeth to give birth and she had a son
 and it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the lord had been very good to her and they took part in her joy
 and on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child and they would have given him the name of zacharias his fathers name
 but his mother made answer and said no his name is john
 and they said not one of your relations has that name
 and they made signs to his father to say what name was to be given to him
 and he sent for writing materials and put down his name is john and they were all surprised
