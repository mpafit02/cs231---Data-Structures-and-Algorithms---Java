 but we give the news of the secret wisdom of god which he had kept in store before the world came into existence for our glory
 of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge for if they had they would not have put the lord of glory on the cross
 but as it says in the holy writings things which the eye saw not and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man such things as god has made ready for those who have love for him
 but god has given us the revelation of these things through his spirit for the spirit makes search into all things even the deep things of god
 for who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him in the same way no one has knowledge of the things of god but the spirit of god
 but we have not the spirit of the world but the spirit which comes from god so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by god
 and these are the things which we say not in the language of mans wisdom but in words given to us by the spirit judging the things of the spirit by the help of the spirit
 for the natural man is not able to take in the things of the spirit of god for they seem foolish to him and he is not able to have knowledge of them because such knowledge comes only through the spirit
 but he who has the spirit though judging all things is himself judged by no one
 for who has knowledge of the mind of the lord so as to be his teacher but we have the mind of christ
 and the teaching i gave you my brothers was such as i was able to give not to those who have the spirit but to those who are still in the flesh even to children in christ
 i gave you milk and not meat because you were then unable to take it and even now you are not able
 because you are still in the flesh for when there is envy and division among you are you not still walking after the way of the flesh even as natural men
 for when one says i am of paul and another says i am of apollos are you not talking like natural men
 what then is apollos and what is paul they are but servants who gave you the good news as god gave it to them
 i did the planting apollos did the watering but god gave the increase
 so then the planter is nothing and the waterer is nothing but god who gives the increase
 now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work
 for we are workers with god you are gods planting gods building
 in the measure of the grace given to me i as a wise master builder have put the base in position and another goes on building on it but let every man take care what he puts on it
 for there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down which is jesus christ
 but on the base a man may put gold silver stones of great price wood dry grass cut stems
 every mans work will be made clear in that day because it will be tested by fire and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every mans work
 if any mans work comes through the test he will have a reward
 if the fire puts an end to any mans work it will be his loss but he will get salvation himself though as by fire
 do you not see that you are gods holy house and that the spirit of god has his place in you
 if anyone makes the house of god unclean god will put an end to him for the house of god is holy and you are his house
 let no man have a false idea if any man seems to himself to be wise among you let him become foolish so that he may be wise
 for the wisdom of this world is foolish before god as it is said in the holy writings he who takes the wise in their secret designs
 and again the lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise that they are nothing
