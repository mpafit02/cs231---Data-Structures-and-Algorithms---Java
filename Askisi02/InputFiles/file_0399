 so boiling my son we had a meal of him and on the day after i said to her now give your son for our food but she has put her son in a secret place
 then the king hearing what the woman said took his robes in his hands violently parting them and while he was walking on the wall the people looking saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh
 then he said may gods punishment come on me if elisha the son of shaphat keeps his head on his body after this day
 but elisha was in his house and the responsible men were seated there with him and before the king got there elisha said to those who were with him do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life
 while he was still talking to them the king came down and said this evil is from the lord why am i to go on waiting any longer for the lord
 then elisha said give ear to the word of the lord the lord says tomorrow about this time a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the market place of samaria
 then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of god even if the lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible and he said your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
 now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town and they said to one another why are we waiting here for death
 if we say we will go into the town there is no food in the town and we will come to our end there and if we go on waiting here death will come to us come then let us give ourselves up to the army of aram if they let us go on living then life will be ours and if they put us to death then death will be ours
 so in the half light they got up to go to the tents of aram but when they came to the outer line of tents there was no one there
 for the lord had made the sound of carriages and horses and the noise of a great army come to the ears of the aramaeans so that they said to one another truly the king of israel has got the kings of the hittites and of the egyptians for a price to make an attack on us
 so they got up and went in flight in the half light without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods they went in flight fearing for their lives
 and when those lepers came to the outer line of tents they went into one tent and had food and drink and took from it silver and gold and clothing which they put in a secret place then they came back and went into another tent from which they took more goods which they put away in a secret place
 then they said to one another we are not doing right today is a day of good news and we say nothing if we go on waiting here till the morning punishment will come to us so let us go and give the news to those of the kings house
 so they came in and crying out to the door keepers of the town they gave them the news saying we came to the tents of the aramaeans and there was no one there and no voice of man only the horses and the asses in their places and the tents as they were
 then the door keepers crying out gave the news to those inside the kings house
 then the king got up in the night and said to his servants this is my idea of what the aramaeans have done to us they have knowledge that we are without food and so they have gone out of their tents and are waiting secretly in the open country saying when they come out of the town we will take them living and get into the town
 and one of his servants said in answer send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of israel who are still living here if they come to their death they will be the same as all those of israel who have gone to destruction let us send and see
 so they took two horsemen and the king sent them after the army of the aramaeans saying go and see
 and they went after them as far as jordan and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the aramaeans in their flight so those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king
 then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the aramaeans so a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel as the lord had said
 and the king gave authority to that captain on whose arm he was supported to have control over the doorway into the town but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people as the man of god had said when the king went down to him
 so the words of the man of god came true which he said to the king two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel tomorrow about this time in the market place of samaria
 and that captain said to the man of god even if the lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible and he said to him your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
 and such was his fate for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people in the doorway into the town
 now elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life go now with all the people of your house and get a living place for yourselves wherever you are able for by the word of the lord there will be great need of food in the land and this will go on for seven years
 so the woman got up and did as the man of god said and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the philistines for seven years
 and when the seven years were ended the woman came back from the land of the philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land
 now the king was talking with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying now give me an account of all the great things elisha has done
 and while he was giving the king the story of how elisha had given life to the dead the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land and gehazi said my lord king this is the woman and this is her son whose life elisha gave back to him
