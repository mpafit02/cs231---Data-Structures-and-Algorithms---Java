 in the way ordered by moses the servant of the lord as it is recorded in the book of the law of moses an altar of uncut stones untouched by any iron instrument and on it they made burned offerings and peace offerings to the lord
 and he made there on the stones a copy of the law of moses writing it before the eyes of the children of israel
 and all israel those who were israelites by birth as well as the men from other lands living with them and their responsible men and their overseers and judges took their places round the ark in front of the priests the levites whose work it was to take up the ark of the lords agreement half of them were stationed in front of mount gerizim and half in front of mount ebal in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of israel which moses the servant of the lord had given
 and after he gave them all the words of the law the blessing and the curse as it is all recorded in the book of the law
 reading to all the meeting of israel with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them every word of the orders which moses had given
 now on hearing the news of these things all the kings on the west side of jordan in the hill country and the lowlands and by the great sea in front of lebanon the hittites and the amorites the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
 came together with one purpose to make war against joshua and israel
 and the men of gibeon hearing what joshua had done to jericho and ai
 acting with deceit got food together as if for a long journey and took old food bags for their asses and old and cracked wine skins kept together with cord
 and put old stitched up shoes on their feet and old clothing on their backs and all the food they had with them was dry and broken up
 and they came to joshua to the tent circle at gilgal and said to him and to the men of israel we have come from a far country so now make an agreement with us
 and the men of israel said to the hivites it may be that you are living among us how then may we make an agreement with you
 and they said to joshua we are your servants then joshua said to them who are you and where do you come from
 and they said to him your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the lord your god for the story of his great name and of all he did in egypt has come to our ears
 and what he did to the two kings of the amorites east of jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan at ashtaroth
 so the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us take food with you for the journey and go to them and say to them we are your servants so now make an agreement with us
 this bread which we have with us for our food we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you but now see it has become dry and broken up
 and these wine skins were new when we put the wine in them and now they are cracked as you see and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here
 and the men took some of their food without requesting directions from the lord
 so joshua made peace with them and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them
 now three days after when they had made this agreement with them they had word that these men were their neighbours living near them
 and the children of israel went forward on their journey and on the third day came to their towns now their towns were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kiriath jearim
 and the children of israel did not put them to death because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the lord the god of israel and all the people made an outcry against the chiefs
 but all the chiefs said to the people we have taken an oath to them by the lord the god of israel and so we may not put our hands on them
 this is what we will do to them we will not put them to death for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them
 keep them living and let them be servants cutting wood and getting water for all the people and all the people did as the chiefs had said to them
 then joshua sent for them and said to them why have you been false to us saying we are very far from you when you are living among us
 now because of this you are cursed and you will for ever be our servants cutting wood and getting water for the house of my god
 and answering joshua they said because it came to the ears of your servants that the lord your god had given orders to his servant moses to give you all this land and to send destruction on all the people living in it because of you so fearing greatly for our lives because of you we have done this
 and now we are in your hands do to us whatever seems good and right to you
