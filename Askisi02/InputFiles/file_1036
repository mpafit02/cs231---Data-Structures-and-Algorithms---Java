 her rulers are like loud voiced lions in her her judges are wolves of the evening crushing up the bones before the morning
 her prophets are good for nothing persons full of deceit her priests have made the holy place unclean and have gone violently against the law
 the lord in her is upright he will not do evil every morning he lets his righteousness be seen he is unchanging but the evil doer has no sense of shame
 i have had the nations cut off their towers are broken down i have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them destruction has overtaken their towns so that there is no man living in them
 i said certainly you will go in fear of me and come under my training so that whatever i may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes but they got up early and made all their works evil
 for this reason go on waiting for me says the lord till the day when i come up as a witness for my purpose is to send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together so that i may let loose on them my passion even all my burning wrath for all the earth will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion
 for then i will give the people a clean language so that they may all make prayer to the lord and be his servants with one mind
 from over the rivers of ethiopia and from the sides of the north they will come to me with an offering
 in that day you will have no shame on account of all the things in which you did evil against me for then i will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride and you will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain
 but i will still have among you a quiet and poor people and they will put their faith in the name of the lord
 the rest of israel will do no evil and say no false words the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their mouth for they will take their food and their rest and no one will be a cause of fear to them
 make melody o daughter of zion give a loud cry o israel be glad and let your heart be full of joy o daughter of jerusalem
 the lord has taken away those who were judging you he has sent your haters far away the king of israel even the lord is among you you will have no more fear of evil
 in that day it will be said to jerusalem have no fear o zion let not your hands be feeble
 the lord your god is among you as a strong saviour he will be glad over you with joy he will make his love new again he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast
 i will take away your troubles lifting up your shame from off you
 see at that time i will put an end to all who have been troubling you i will give salvation to her whose steps are uncertain and get together her who has been sent in flight and i will make them a cause of praise and an honoured name in all the earth when i let their fate be changed
 at that time i will make you come in at that time i will get you together for i will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when i let your fate be changed before your eyes says the lord
