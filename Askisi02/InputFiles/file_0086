 peace be to the brothers and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
 grace be with all those who have true love for our lord jesus christ
 paul an apostle  not from men and not through man but through jesus christ and god the father who made him come back from the dead 
 and all the brothers who are with me to the churches of galatia
 grace to you and peace from god the father and our lord jesus christ
 who gave himself for our sins so that he might make us free from this present evil world after the purpose of our god and father
 to whom be the glory for ever and ever so be it
 i am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of christ to good news of a different sort
 which is not another sort only there are some who give you trouble desiring to make changes in the good news of christ
 but even if we or an angel from heaven were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you let there be a curse on him
 as we have said before so say i now again if any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you let there be a curse on him
 am i now using arguments to men or god or is it my desire to give men pleasure if i was still pleasing men i would not be a servant of christ
 because i say to you my brothers that the good news of which i was the preacher is not mans
 for i did not get it from man and i was not given teaching in it but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ
 for news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the jews religion how i was cruel without measure to the church of god and did great damage to it
 and i went farther in the jews religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers
 but when it was the good pleasure of god by whom i was marked out even from my mothers body through his grace
 to give the revelation of his son in me so that i might give the news of him to the gentiles then i did not take the opinion of flesh and blood
 and i went not up to jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but i went away into arabia and again i came back to damascus
 then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see cephas and was there with him fifteen days
 but of the other apostles i saw only james the lords brother
 now god is witness that the things which i am writing to you are true
 then i came to the parts of syria and cilicia
 and the churches of judaea which were in christ still had no knowledge of my face or person
 only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him
 and they gave glory to god in me
 then after the space of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus with me
 and i went up by revelation and i put before them the good news which i was preaching among the gentiles but privately before those who were of good name so that the work which i was or had been doing might not be without effect
 but not even titus who was with me being a greek was made to undergo circumcision
 and that because of the false brothers let in secretly who came searching out our free condition which we have in christ jesus so that they might make servants of us
