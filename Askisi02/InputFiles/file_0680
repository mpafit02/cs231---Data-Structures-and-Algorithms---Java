 so i will go after trouble for them and will send on them what they are fearing because no one made answer to my voice or gave ear to my word but they did what was evil in my eyes going after that in which i took no pleasure
 give ear to the word of the lord you who are in fear at his word your countrymen hating you and driving you out because of my name have said let the lords glory be made clear so that we may see your joy but they will be put to shame
 there is a noise of war from the town a sound from the temple the voice of the lord giving punishment to his haters
 before her pains came she gave birth before her pains she gave birth to a man child
 when has such a story come to mens ears who has seen such things will a land come to birth in one day will a nation be given birth in a minute for when zions pains came on her she gave birth to her children straight away
 will i by whom the birth was started not make it complete says the lord will i who make children come to birth let them be kept back says your god
 have joy with jerusalem and be glad with her all you her lovers take part in her joy all you who are sorrowing for her
 so that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts and be delighted with the full measure of her glory
 for the lord says see i will make her peace like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream and she will take her children in her arms gently caring for them on her knees
 as to one who is comforted by his mother so will i give you comfort and you will be comforted in jerusalem
 and you will see it and your heart will be glad and your bones will get new strength like young grass and the hand of the lord will be seen at work for his servants and his wrath against his haters
 for the lord is coming with fire and his war carriages will be like the storm wind to give punishment in the heat of his wrath and his passion is like flames of fire
 for with fire and sword will the lord come judging all the earth and his sword will be on all flesh and great numbers will be put to death by him
 as for those who keep themselves separate and make themselves clean in the gardens going after one in the middle taking pigs flesh for food and other disgusting things such as the mouse their works and their thoughts will come to an end together says the lord
 and i am coming to get together all nations and tongues and they will come and will see my glory
 and i will put a sign among them and i will send those who are still living to the nations to tarshish put and lud meshech and rosh tubal and javan to the sea lands far away who have not had word of me or seen my glory and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations
 and they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the lord on horses and in carriages and in carts and on asses and on camels to my holy mountain jerusalem says the lord as the children of israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord
 and some of them will i take for priests and levites says the lord
 for as the new heaven and the new earth which i will make will be for ever before me says the lord so will your seed and your name be for ever
 and it will be that from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh will come to give worship before me says the lord
 and they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me for their worm will ever be living and their fire will never be put out and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh
 now it came about in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah the king of israel came up to jerusalem to make war against it but were not able to overcome it
 and word came to the family of david that aram had put up its tents in ephraim and the kings heart and the hearts of his people were moved like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind
 then the lord said to isaiah go out now you and shear jashub your son and you will come across ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool in the highway of the washermans field
 and say to him take care and be quiet have no fear and do not let your heart be feeble because of these two ends of smoking fire wood because of the bitter wrath of rezin and aram and of the son of remaliah
 because aram has made evil designs against you saying
 let us go up against judah troubling her and forcing our way into her and let us put up a king in her even the son of tabeel
 this is the word of the lord god this design will not come about or be effected
 for the head of aram is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin  and in sixty five years from now ephraim will be broken and will no longer be a people 
 and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son if you will not have faith your kingdom will be broken
