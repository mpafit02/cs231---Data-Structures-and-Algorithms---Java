 our holy and beautiful house where our fathers gave praise to you is burned with fire and all the things of our desire have come to destruction
 in view of all this will you still do nothing o lord will you keep quiet and go on increasing our punishment
 i have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me i have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me i said here am i here am i to a nation which gave no respect to my name
 all day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people who go in an evil way after the purposes of their hearts
 a people who make me angry every day making offerings in gardens and burning perfumes on bricks
 who are seated in the resting places of the dead and by night are in the secret places who take pigs flesh for food and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels
 who say keep away do not come near me for fear that i make you holy these are a smoke in my nose a fire burning all day
 see it is recorded before me says the lord i will not keep back my hand till i have sent punishment
 for their sins and the sins of their fathers who were burning perfumes on the mountains and saying evil things against me on the hills so i will take the measure of their sins and will send the punishment for them into their breast
 this is the word of the lord as the new wine is seen in the grapes and they say do not send destruction on it for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants in order that i may not put an end to them all
 and i will take a seed out of jacob and out of judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage and the people i have taken to be mine will have it for themselves and my servants will have their resting place there
 and sharon will be a grass land for the flocks and the valley of achor a resting place for the herds for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me
 but as for you who have given up the lord who have no care for my holy mountain who get ready a table for chance and make offerings of mixed wine to fate
 your fate will be the sword and you will all go down to death because when my voice came to you you made no answer you did not give ear to my word but you did what was evil in my eyes desiring what was not pleasing to me
 for this cause says the lord god my servants will have food but you will be in need of food my servants will have drink but you will be dry my servants will have joy but you will be shamed
 my servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts but you will be crying for sorrow and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit
 and your name will become a curse to my people and the lord god will put you to death and give his servants another name
 so that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true god and he who takes an oath will do so by the true god because the past troubles are gone out of mind and because they are covered from my eyes
 for see i am making a new heaven and a new earth and the past things will be gone completely out of mind
 but men will be glad and have joy for ever in what i am making for i am making jerusalem a delight and her people a joy
 and i will be glad over jerusalem and have joy in my people and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her or the voice of grief
 no longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed
 and they will be building houses and living in them planting vine gardens and getting the fruit of them
 they will no longer be building for the use of others or planting for others to have the fruit for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands
 their work will not be for nothing and they will not give birth to children for destruction for they are a seed to whom the lord has given his blessing and their offspring will be with them
 and before they make their request i will give an answer and while they are still making prayer to me i will give ear
 the wolf and the lamb will take their food together and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox but dust will be the snakes food there will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain says the lord
 the lord says heaven is the seat of my power and earth is the resting place for my feet what sort of house will you make for me and what place will be my resting place
 for all these things my hand has made and they are mine says the lord but to this man only will i give attention to him who is poor and broken in spirit fearing my word
 he who puts an ox to death puts a man to death he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pigs blood he who makes an offering of perfumes for a sign gives worship to an image as they have gone after their desires and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things
