 and i will let the fate of my people israel be changed and they will be building up again the waste towns and living in them they will again be planting vine gardens and taking the wine for their drink and they will make gardens and get the fruit of them
 and i will have them planted in their land and never again will they be uprooted from their land which i have given them says the lord your god
 in the third year of the rule of jehoiakim king of judah nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to jerusalem shutting it in with his forces
 and the lord gave into his hands jehoiakim king of judah with some of the vessels of the house of god and he took them away into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he put the vessels into the store house of his god
 and the king gave orders to ashpenaz the captain of his unsexed servants to take in some of the children of israel certain of the kings family and those of high birth
 young men who were strong and healthy good looking and trained in all wisdom having a good education and much knowledge and able to take positions in the kings house and to have them trained in the writing and language of the chaldaeans
 and a regular amount of food and wine every day from the kings table was ordered for them by the king and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king
 and among these there were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
 and the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names to daniel he gave the name of belteshazzar to hananiah the name of shadrach to mishael the name of meshach and to azariah the name of abed nego
 and daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the kings food or wine so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean
 and god put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for daniel
 and the captain of the unsexed servants said to daniel i am in fear of my lord the king who has given orders about your food and your drink what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation then you would have put my head in danger from the king
 then daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
 put your servants to the test for ten days let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink
 then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the kings table and having seen them do to your servants as it seems right to you
 so he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days
 and at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the kings table
 so the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink and gave them grain
 now as for these four young men god gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book learning and wisdom and daniel was wise in all visions and dreams
 now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to nebuchadnezzar
 and the king had talk with them and among them all there was no one like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah so they were given places before the king
 and in any business needing wisdom and good sense about which the king put questions to them he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom
 and daniel went on till the first year of king cyrus
 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a secret was unfolded to daniel whose name was belteshazzar and the thing was true even a hard work and he had knowledge of it and the vision was clear to him
 in those days i daniel gave myself up to grief for three full weeks
 i had no pleasing food no meat or wine came into my mouth and i put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended
 and on the twenty fourth day of the first month i was by the side of the great river
 and lifting up my eyes i saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe and round him there was a band of gold of the best gold
 and his body was like the beryl and his face had the look of a thunder flame and his eyes were like burning lights and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army
 and i daniel was the only one who saw the vision for the men who were with me did not see it but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover
