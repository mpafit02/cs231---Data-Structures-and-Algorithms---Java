 my prayer is for them my prayer is not for the world but for those whom you have given to me because they are yours
  all mine are yours and yours are mine  and i have glory in them
 and now i will be no longer in the world but they are in the world and i come to you holy father keep them in your name which you have given to me so that they may be one even as we are one
 while i was with them i kept them safe in your name which you have given to me i took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction but only the son of destruction so that the writings might come true
 and now i come to you and these things i say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them
 i have given your word to them and they are hated by the world because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
 my prayer is not that you will take them out of the world but that you will keep them from the evil one
 they are not of the world any more than i am of the world
 make them holy by the true word your word is the true word
 even as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
 and for them i make myself holy so that they may be made truly holy
 my prayer is not for them only but for all who will have faith in me through their word
 may they all be one  even as you father are in me and i am in you so let them be in us so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me
 and the glory which you have given to me i have given to them so that they may be one even as we are one
 i in them and you in me so that they may be made completely one and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as i am loved by you
 father it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where i am so that they may see my glory which you have given to me because you had love for me before the world came into being
 father of righteousness i have knowledge of you though the world has not and to these it is clear that you sent me
 and i have given to them knowledge of your name and will give it so that the love which you have for me may be in them and i in them
 when jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream kedron to a garden into which he went with his disciples
 and judas who was false to him had knowledge of the place because jesus went there frequently with his disciples
 so judas getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and pharisees went there with lights and with arms
 then jesus having knowledge of everything which was coming on him went forward and said to them who are you looking for
 their answer was jesus the nazarene jesus said i am he and judas who was false to him was there at their side
 and when he said to them i am he they went back falling to the earth
 so again he put the question to them who are you looking for and they said jesus the nazarene
 jesus made answer i have said that i am he if you are looking for me let these men go away
  he said this so that his words might come true i have kept safe all those whom you gave to me 
 then simon peter who had a sword took it out and gave the high priests servant a blow cutting off his right ear the servants name was malchus
 then jesus said to peter put back your sword am i not to take the cup which my father has given to me
 then the band and the chief captain and the police took jesus and put cords round him
