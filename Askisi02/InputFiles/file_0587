 and the lord said am i to keep back from abraham the knowledge of what i do
 seeing that abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing
 for i have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him to keep the ways of the lord to do what is good and right so that the lord may do to abraham as he has said
 and the lord said because the outcry against sodom and gomorrah is very great and their sin is very evil
 i will go down now and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me and if they are not i will see
 and the men turning from that place went on to sodom but abraham was still waiting before the lord
 and abraham came near and said will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners
 if by chance there are fifty upright men in the town will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men
 let such a thing be far from you to put the upright to death with the sinner will not the judge of all the earth do right
 and the lord said if there are fifty upright men in the town i will have mercy on it because of them
 and abraham answering said truly i who am only dust have undertaken to put my thoughts before the lord
 if by chance there are five less than fifty upright men will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five and he said i will not give it to destruction if there are forty five
 and again he said to him by chance there may be forty there and he said i will not do it if there are forty
 and he said let not the lord be angry with me if i say what if there are thirty there and he said i will not do it if there are thirty
 and he said see now i have undertaken to put my thoughts before the lord what if there are twenty there and he said i will have mercy because of the twenty
 and he said o let not the lord be angry and i will say only one word more by chance there may be ten there and he said i will have mercy because of the ten
 and the lord went on his way when his talk with abraham was ended and abraham went back to his place
 and at nightfall the two angels came to sodom and lot was seated at the way into the town and when he saw them he got up and came before them falling down on his face to the earth
 and he said my masters come now into your servants house and take your rest there for the night and let your feet be washed and early in the morning you may go on your way and they said not so but we will take our nights rest in the street
 but he made his request more strongly so they went with him into his house and he got food ready for them and made unleavened bread of which they took
 but before they had gone to bed the men of the town all the men of sodom came round the house young and old from every part of the town
 and crying out to lot they said where are the men who came to your house this night send them out to us so that we may take our pleasure with them
 and lot went out to them in the doorway shutting the door after him
 and he said my brothers do not this evil
 see now i have two unmarried daughters i will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you only do nothing to these men for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof
 and they said give way there this one man they said came here from a strange country and will he now be our judge now we will do worse to you than to them and pushing violently against lot they came near to get the door broken in
 but the men put out their hands and took lot into the house to them shutting the door again
 but the men who were outside the door they made blind all of them small and great so that they were tired out with looking for the door
 then the men said to lot are there any others of your family here sons in law or sons or daughters take them all out of this place
 for we are about to send destruction on this place because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the lord and the lord has sent us to put an end to the town
