 and four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving
 and when they were unable to get near him because of all the people they got the roof uncovered where he was and when it was broken up they let down the bed on which the man was
 and jesus seeing their faith said to him son you have forgiveness for your sins
 but there were certain of the scribes seated there and reasoning in their hearts
 why does this man say such things he has no respect for god from whom does forgiveness come but from god only
 and jesus having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts said to them why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts
 which is the simpler to say to a man who is ill you have forgiveness for your sins or get up take up your bed and go
 but so that you may see that the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth  he said to the man 
 i say to you get up take up your bed and go to your house
 and he got up and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all so that they were all full of wonder and gave glory to god saying we have never seen anything like this
 and he went out again by the seaside and all the people came to him and he gave them teaching
 and when he went by he saw levi the son of alphaeus seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him come with me and he got up and went with him
 and it came about that he was seated at meat in his house and a number of tax farmers and sinners were at table with jesus and his disciples for there were a great number of them and they came after him
 and the scribes of the pharisees when they saw that he was taking food with the tax farmers and sinners said to his disciples why does he take food and drink with such men
 and jesus hearing it said to them those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill i have come not to get the upright but sinners
 and johns disciples and the pharisees were taking no food and they came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees go without food but your disciples do not
 and jesus said to them will the friends of a newly married man go without food while he is with them as long as they have him with them they will not go without food
 but the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
 no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat or the new by pulling away from the old makes a worse hole
 and no man puts new wine into old wine skins or the skins will be burst by the wine and the wine and the skins will be wasted but new wine has to be put into new wine skins
 and it came about that on the sabbath day he was going through the grain fields and while they were walking his disciples took the heads of grain
 and the pharisees said to him why are they doing what it is not right to do on the sabbath
 and he said to them have you no knowledge of what david did when he had need and was without food he and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god when abiathar was high priest and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
 and he said to them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
 so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
 and he went again into the synagogue and there was a man there whose hand was dead
 and they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the sabbath day so that they might have something against him
 and he said to the man get up and come forward
 and he said to them is it right to do good on the sabbath or to do evil to give life or to put to death but they said nothing
