 then the children of israel came back from going after the philistines and took their goods from the tents
 and david took the head of the philistine to jerusalem but the metal war dress and the arms he put in his tent
 and when saul saw david going out against the philistine he said to abner the captain of the army abner whose son is this young man and abner said on your life o king i have no idea
 and the king said make search and see whose son this young man is
 and when david was coming back after the destruction of the philistine abner took him to saul with the head of the philistine in his hand
 and saul said to him young man whose son are you and david in answer said i am the son of your servant jesse of beth lehem
 now after davids talk with saul was ended the soul of jonathan was joined with the soul of david and david became as dear to him as his very life
 and that day saul took david and would not let him go back to his fathers house
 then jonathan and david made an agreement together because of jonathans love for david
 and jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to david with all his military dress even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body
 and david went wherever saul sent him and did wisely and saul put him at the head of his men of war and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to sauls servants
 now on their way when david came back after the destruction of the philistine the women came out of all the towns of israel with songs and dances meeting david with melody and joy and instruments of music
 and the women answering one another in their song said saul has put to death his thousands and david his tens of thousands
 and saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him and he said they have given david credit for tens of thousands and to me for only thousands what more is there for him but the kingdom
 and from that day saul was looking with envy on david
 now on the day after an evil spirit from god came on saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house while david was making music for him as he did day by day and saul had his spear in his hand
 and saul balancing the spear in his hand said i will give david a blow pinning him to the wall and david got away from him twice
 and saul went in fear of david because the lord was with david and had gone away from saul
 so saul sent him away and made him a captain over a thousand and he went about his business before the people
 and in all his undertakings david did wisely and the lord was with him
 and when saul saw how wisely he did he was in fear of him
 but david was loved by all israel and judah for he went out and came in before them
 and saul said to david here is my oldest daughter merab whom i will give you for your wife only be strong for me fighting in the lords wars for saul said let it not be through me that his fate comes to him but through the philistines
 and david said to saul who am i and what is my fathers family in israel that i am to be son in law to the king
 but when the time came to give merab sauls daughter to david she was given to adriel of meholath
 and sauls daughter michal was in love with david and saul had word of it and was pleased
 and saul said i will give her to him so that she may be a cause of danger to him and so that the hands of the philistines may be against him so saul said to david today you are to become my son in law for the second time
 and saul gave his servants orders saying have talk with david secretly and say to him see how the king has delight in you and how you are loved by all his servants then be the kings son in law
 and sauls servants said these things to david and david said does it seem to you a small thing to be the kings son in law seeing that i am a poor man of no great name
 and the servants of saul gave him an account of what david had said
