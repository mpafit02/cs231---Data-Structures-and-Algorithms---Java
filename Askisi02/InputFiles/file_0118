 and they kept coming and saying long life to the king of the jews  and they gave him blows with their hands
 and pilate went out again and said to them see i let him come out to you to make it clear to you that i see no wrong in him
 then jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate said to them here is the man 
 so when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry to the cross  to the cross  pilate said to them take him yourselves and put him on the cross i see no crime in him
 and the jews made answer we have a law and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the son of god
 when this saying came to pilates ears his fear became greater
 and he went again into the praetorium and said to jesus where do you come from but jesus gave him no answer
 then pilate said to him you say nothing to me is it not clear to you that i have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross
 jesus gave this answer you would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by god so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin
 hearing this pilate had a desire to let him go free but the jews said in a loud voice if you let this man go you are not caesars friend everyone who makes himself a king goes against caesar
 so when these words came to pilates ear he took jesus out seating himself in the judges seat in a place named in hebrew gabbatha or the stone floor
  it was the day when they made ready for the passover and it was about the sixth hour  and he said to the jews there is your king 
 then they gave a loud cry away with him  away with him  to the cross  pilate said to them am i to put your king to death on the cross the chief priests said in answer we have no king but caesar
 so then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross and they took jesus away
 and he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named dead mans head  in hebrew golgotha 
 where they put him on the cross with two others one on this side and one on that and jesus in the middle
 and pilate put on the cross a statement in writing the writing was jesus the nazarene the king of the jews
 the writing was seen by a number of the jews for the place where jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town and the writing was in hebrew and latin and greek
 then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not put the king of the jews but he said i am the king of the jews
 but pilate made answer what i have put in writing will not be changed
 and when jesus was nailed to the cross the men of the army took his clothing and made a division of it into four parts to every man a part and they took his coat now the coat was without a join made out of one bit of cloth
 so they said among themselves let this not be cut up but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it  they did this so that the writings might come true which say they made a distribution of my clothing among them and my coat they put to the decision of chance  this was what the men of the army did
 now by the side of the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene
 so when jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him he said to his mother mother there is your son 
 then he said to the disciple there is your mother  and from that hour the disciple took her to his house
 after this being conscious that all things had now been done so that the writings might come true jesus said give me water
 now there was a vessel ready full of bitter wine and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth
 so when jesus had taken the wine he said all is done and with his head bent he gave up his spirit
 now it was the day of getting ready for the passover and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the sabbath  because the day of that sabbath was a great day  the jews made a request to pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
 so the men of the army came and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with jesus
