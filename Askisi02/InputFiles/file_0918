 the words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food and go down into the inner parts of the stomach
 he who does not give his mind to his work is brother to him who makes destruction
 the name of the lord is a strong tower the upright man running into it is safe
 the property of a man of wealth is his strong town and it is as a high wall in the thoughts of his heart
 before destruction the heart of man is full of pride and before honour goes a gentle spirit
 to give an answer before hearing is a foolish thing and a cause of shame
 the spirit of a man will be his support when he is ill but how may a broken spirit be lifted up
 the heart of the man of good sense gets knowledge the ear of the wise is searching for knowledge
 a mans offering makes room for him letting him come before great men
 the man who first puts his cause before the judge seems to be in the right but then his neighbour comes and puts his cause in its true light
 the decision of chance puts an end to argument parting the strong
 a brother wounded is like a strong town and violent acts are like a locked tower
 with the fruit of a mans mouth his stomach will be full the produce of his lips will be his in full measure
 death and life are in the power of the tongue and those to whom it is dear will have its fruit for their food
 whoever gets a wife gets a good thing and has the approval of the lord
 the poor man makes requests for grace but the man of wealth gives a rough answer
 there are friends who may be a mans destruction but there is a lover who keeps nearer than a brother
 better is the poor man whose ways are upright than the man of wealth whose ways are twisted
 further without knowledge desire is not good and he who is over quick in acting goes out of the right way
 by his foolish behaviour a mans ways are turned upside down and his heart is bitter against the lord
 wealth makes a great number of friends but the poor man is parted from his friend
 a false witness will not go without punishment and the breather out of deceit will not go free
 great numbers will make attempts to get the approval of a ruler and every man is the special friend of him who has something to give
 all the brothers of the poor man are against him how much more do his friends go far from him  
 he who gets wisdom has love for his soul he who keeps good sense will get what is truly good
 a false witness will not go without punishment and the breather out of deceit will be cut off
 material comfort is not good for the foolish much less for a servant to be put over rulers
 a mans good sense makes him slow to wrath and the overlooking of wrongdoing is his glory
 the kings wrath is like the loud cry of a lion but his approval is like dew on the grass
 a foolish son is the destruction of his father and the bitter arguments of a wife are like drops of rain falling without end
