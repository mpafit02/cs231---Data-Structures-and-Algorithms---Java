 because the work of the law is seen in their hearts their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval
 in the day when god will be a judge of the secrets of men as it says in the good news of which i am a preacher through jesus christ
 but as for you who have the name of jew and are resting on the law and take pride in god
 and have knowledge of his desires and are a judge of the things which are different having the learning of the law
 in the belief that you are a guide to the blind a light to those in the dark
 a teacher of the foolish having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true
 you who give teaching to others do you give it to yourself you who say that a man may not take what is not his do you take what is not yours
 you who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife are you true to yours you who are a hater of images do you do wrong to the house of god
 you who take pride in the law are you doing wrong to the honour of god by behaviour which is against the law
 for the name of god is shamed among the gentiles because of you as it is said in the holy writings
 it is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not
 if those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law will it not be credited to them as circumcision
 and they by their keeping of the law without circumcision will be judges of you by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision
 the true jew is not one who is only so publicly and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh
 but he is a jew who is a secret one whose circumcision is of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not from men but from god
 how then is the jew better off or what profit is there in circumcision
 much in every way first of all because the words of god were given to them
 and if some have no faith will that make the faith of god without effect
 in no way but let god be true though every man is seen to be untrue as it is said in the writings that your words may be seen to be true and you may be seen to be right when you are judged
 but if the righteousness of god is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said is it wrong for god to be angry  as men may say 
 in no way because if it is so how is god able to be the judge of all the world
 but if because i am untrue god being seen to be true gets more glory why am i to be judged as a sinner
 let us not do evil so that good may come  a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made  because such behaviour will have its right punishment
 what then are we worse off than they in no way because we have before made it clear that jews as well as greeks are all under the power of sin
 as it is said in the holy writings there is not one who does righteousness
 not one who has the knowledge of what is right not one who is a searcher after god
 they have all gone out of the way there is no profit in any of them there is not one who does good not so much as one
 their throat is like an open place of death with their tongues they have said what is not true the poison of snakes is under their lips
 whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words
 their feet are quick in running after blood
