 then pharaoh said i will let you go to make an offering to the lord your god in the waste land but do not go very far away and make prayer for me
 and moses said when i go out from you i will make prayer to the lord that the cloud of flies may go away from pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow only let pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offering to the lord
 then moses went out from pharaoh and made prayer to the lord
 and the lord did as moses said and took away the cloud of flies from pharaoh and from his servants and from his people not one was to be seen
 but again pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go
 then the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for if you will not let them go but still keep them in your power
 then the hand of the lord will put on your cattle in the field on the horses and the asses and the camels on the herds and the flocks a very evil disease
 and the lord will make a division between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt there will be no loss of any of the cattle of israel
 and the time was fixed by the lord and he said tomorrow the lord will do this thing in the land
 and on the day after the lord did as he had said causing the death of all the cattle of egypt but there was no loss of any of the cattle of israel
 and pharaoh sent and got word that there was no loss of any of the cattle of israel but the heart of pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go
 and the lord said to moses and to aaron take in your hand a little dust from the fire and let moses send it in a shower up to heaven before the eyes of pharaoh
 and it will become small dust over all the land of egypt and will be a skin disease bursting out in wounds on man and beast through all the land of egypt
 so they took some dust from the fire and placing themselves before pharaoh moses sent it out in a shower up to heaven and it became a skin disease bursting out on man and on beast
 and the wonder workers were not able to take their places before moses because of the disease for the disease was on the wonder workers and on all the egyptians
 and the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he would not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and take your place before pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for this time i will send all my punishments on yourself and on your servants and on your people so that you may see that there is no other like me in all the earth
 for if i had put the full weight of my hand on you and your people you would have been cut off from the earth
 but for this very reason i have kept you from destruction to make clear to you my power and so that my name may be honoured through all the earth
 are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go
 truly tomorrow about this time i will send down an ice storm such as never was in egypt from its earliest days till now
 then send quickly and get in your cattle and all you have from the fields for if any man or beast in the field has not been put under cover the ice storm will come down on them with destruction
 then everyone among the servants of pharaoh who had the fear of the lord made his servants and his cattle come quickly into the house
 and he who gave no attention to the word of the lord kept his servants and his cattle in the field
 and the lord said to moses now let your hand be stretched out to heaven so that there may be an ice storm on all the land of egypt on man and on beast and on every plant of the field through all the land of egypt
 and moses put out his rod to heaven and the lord sent thunder and an ice storm and fire running down on the earth the lord sent an ice storm on the land of egypt
 so there was an ice storm with fire running through it coming down with great force such as never was in all the land of egypt from the time when it became a nation
 and through all the land of egypt the ice storm came down on everything which was in the fields on man and on beast and every green plant was crushed and every tree of the field broken
