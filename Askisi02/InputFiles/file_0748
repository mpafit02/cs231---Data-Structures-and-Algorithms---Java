 if i was glad because my wealth was great and because my hand had got together a great store
 if when i saw the sun shining and the moon moving on its bright way
 a secret feeling of worship came into my heart and my hand gave kisses from my mouth
 that would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges for i would have been false to god on high
 if i was glad at the trouble of my hater and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him
  for i did not let my mouth give way to sin in putting a curse on his life 
 if the men of my tent did not say who has not had full measure of his meat
 the traveller did not take his nights rest in the street and my doors were open to anyone on a journey
 if i kept my evil doings covered and my sin in the secret of my breast
 for fear of the great body of people or for fear that families might make sport of me so that i kept quiet and did not go out of my door
 if only god would give ear to me and the ruler of all would give me an answer  or if what he has against me had been put in writing 
 truly i would take up the book in my hands it would be to me as a crown
 i would make clear the number of my steps i would put it before him like a prince  the words of job are ended
 if my land has made an outcry against me or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow
 if i have taken its produce without payment causing the death of its owners
 then in place of grain let thorns come up and in place of barley evil smelling plants
 so these three men gave no more answers to job because he seemed to himself to be right
 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the family of ram was angry burning with wrath against job because he seemed to himself more right than god
 and he was angry with his three friends because they had been unable to give him an answer and had not made jobs sin clear
 now elihu had kept quiet while job was talking because they were older than he
 and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men he was very angry
 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite made answer and said i am young and you are very old so i was in fear and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you
 i said to myself it is right for the old to say what is in their minds and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom
 but truly it is the spirit in man even the breath of the ruler of all which gives them knowledge
 it is not the old who are wise and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right
 so i say give ear to me and i will put forward my knowledge
 i was waiting for your words i was giving ear to your wise sayings while you were searching out what to say
 i was taking note and truly not one of you was able to make clear jobs error or to give an answer to his words
 take care that you do not say wisdom is here god may overcome him but not man
 i will not put forward words like these or make use of your sayings in answer to him
