 you may say my way is clean and i am free from sin in your eyes
 but if only god would take up the word opening his lips in argument with you
 and would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom and the wonders of his purpose 
 are you able to take gods measure to make discovery of the limits of the ruler of all
 they are higher than heaven what is there for you to do deeper than the underworld and outside your knowledge
 longer in measure than the earth and wider than the sea
 if he goes on his way shutting a man up and putting him to death who may make him go back from his purpose
 for in his eyes men are as nothing he sees evil and takes note of it
 and so a hollow minded man will get wisdom when a young ass of the field gets teaching
 but if you put your heart right stretching out your hands to him
 if you put far away the evil of your hands and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent
 then truly your face will be lifted up with no mark of sin and you will be fixed in your place without fear
 for your sorrow will go from your memory like waters flowing away
 and your life will be brighter than day though it is dark it will become like the morning
 and you will be safe because there is hope after looking round you will take your rest in quiet
 sleeping with no fear of danger and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes
 but the eyes of the evil doers will be wasting away their way of flight is gone and their only hope is the taking of their last breath
 and job made answer and said
 no doubt you have knowledge and wisdom will come to an end with you
 but i have a mind as well as you i am equal to you yes who has not knowledge of such things as these
 it seems that i am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour one who makes his prayer to god and is answered  the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of 
 in the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping
 there is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction and those by whom god is moved to wrath are safe even those whose god is their strength
 but put now a question to the beasts and get teaching from them or to the birds of the heaven and they will make it clear to you
 or to the things which go flat on the earth and they will give you wisdom and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it
 who does not see by all these that the hand of the lord has done this
 in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all flesh of man
 are not words tested by the ear even as food is tasted by the mouth
 old men have wisdom and a long life gives knowledge
 with him there is wisdom and strength power and knowledge are his
