 the jackals will be there and her great ones will be gone they will say there is no longer a kingdom there and all her chiefs will have come to an end
 and thorns will come up in her fair houses and waste plants in her strong towers and foxes will make their holes there and it will be a meeting place for ostriches
 and the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals and the evil spirits will be crying to one another even the night spirit will come and make her resting place there
 the arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there and get her young together under her shade there the hawks will come together by twos
 see what is recorded in the book of the lord all these will be there not one without the other the mouth of the lord has given the order and his spirit has made them come together
 and he has given them their heritage and by his hand it has been measured out to them it will be theirs for ever their resting place from generation to generation
 the waste land and the dry places will be glad the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers
 it will be flowering like the rose it will be full of delight and songs the glory of lebanon will be given to it the pride of carmel and sharon they will see the glory of the lord the power of our god
 make strong the feeble hands give support to the shaking knees
 say to those who are full of fear be strong and take heart see your god will give punishment the reward of god will come he himself will come to be your saviour
 then the eyes of the blind will see and the ears which are stopped will be open
 then will the feeble footed be jumping like a roe and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song for in the waste land streams will be bursting out and waters in the dry places
 and the burning sand will become a pool and the dry earth springs of waters the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land and water plants will take the place of grass
 and a highway will be there its name will be the holy way the unclean and the sinner may not go over it and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish
 no lion will be there or any cruel beast they will not be seen there but those for whom the lord has given a price
 even those whom he has made free will come back again they will come with songs to zion on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
 and it came about in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the walled towns of judah and took them
 and the king of assyria sent the rab shakeh from lachish to jerusalem to king hezekiah with a strong force and he took up his position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans
 and there came out to him eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder
 and the rab shakeh said to them say now to hezekiah these are the words of the great king the king of assyria in what are you placing your hope
 you say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
 see you are basing your hope on that broken rod of egypt which will go into a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is pharaoh king of egypt to all who put their faith in him
 and if you say to me our hope is in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and altars hezekiah has taken away saying to judah and jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar
 and now take a chance with my master the king of assyria and i will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
 how then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in egypt for war carriages and horsemen
 and have i now come to send destruction on this land without the lords authority it was the lord himself who said to me go up against this land and make it waste
 then eliakim and shebna and joah said to the rab shakeh please make use of the aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
 but the rab shakeh said is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
 then the rab shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the jews language give ear to the words of the great king the king of assyria
 this is what the king says do not be tricked by hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
