 and as you have made your souls clean being ruled by what is true and loving one another without deceit see that your love is warm and from the heart
 because you have had a new birth not from the seed of man but from eternal seed through the word of a living and unchanging god
 for it is said all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass the grass becomes dry and the flower dead
 but the word of the lord is eternal and this is the word of the good news which was given to you
 so putting away all wrongdoing and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk
 be full of desire for the true milk of the word as babies at their mothers breasts so that you may go on to salvation
 if you have had a taste of the grace of the lord
 to whom you come as to a living stone not honoured by men but of great and special value to god
 you as living stones are being made into a house of the spirit a holy order of priests making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to god through jesus christ
 because it is said in the writings see i am placing a keystone in zion of great and special value and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame
 and the value is for you who have faith but it is said for those without faith the very stone which the builders put on one side was made the chief stone of the building
 and a stone of falling a rock of trouble the word is the cause of their fall because they go against it and this was the purpose of god
 but you are a special people a holy nation priests and kings a people given up completely to god so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven
 in the past you were not a people but now you are the people of god then there was no mercy for you but now mercy has been given to you
 my loved ones i make this request with all my heart that as those for whom this world is a strange country you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul
 being of good behaviour among the gentiles so that though they say now that you are evil doers they may see your good works and give glory to god when he comes to be their judge
 keep all the laws of men because of the lord those of the king who is over all
 and those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of those who do well
 because it is gods pleasure that foolish and narrow minded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour
 as those who are free not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing but living as the servants of god
 have respect for all loving the brothers fearing god honouring the king
 servants take orders from your masters with all respect not only if they are good and gentle but even if they are bad humoured
 for it is a sign of grace if a man desiring to do right in the eyes of god undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done
 what credit is it if when you have done evil you take your punishment quietly but if you are given punishment for doing right and take it quietly this is pleasing to god
 this is gods purpose for you because jesus himself underwent punishment for you giving you an example so that you might go in his footsteps
 who did no evil and there was no deceit in his mouth
 to sharp words he gave no sharp answer when he was undergoing pain no angry word came from his lips but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness
 he took our sins on himself giving his body to be nailed on the tree so that we being dead to sin might have a new life in righteousness and by his wounds we have been made well
 because like sheep you had gone out of the way but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls
 wives be ruled by your husbands so that even if some of them give no attention to the word their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives
