 go up you horses go rushing on you carriages of war go out you men of war cush and put gripping the body cover and the ludim with bent bows
 but that day is the day of the lord the lord of armies a day of punishment when he will take payment from his haters and the sword will have all its desire drinking their blood in full measure for there is an offering to the lord the lord of armies in the north country by the river euphrates
 go up to gilead and take sweet oil o virgin daughter of egypt there is no help in all your medical arts nothing will make you well
 your shame has come to the ears of the nations and the earth is full of your cry for the strong man is falling against the strong they have come down together
 the word which the lord said to jeremiah the prophet of how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon would come and make war on the land of egypt
 give the news in migdol make it public in noph say take up your positions and make yourselves ready for on every side of you the sword has made destruction
 why has apis your strong one gone in flight he was not able to keep his place because the lord was forcing him down with strength

 by my life says the king whose name is the lord of armies truly like tabor among the mountains and like carmel by the sea so will he come
 o daughter living in egypt make ready the vessels of a prisoner for noph will become a waste it will be burned up and become unpeopled
 egypt is a fair young cow but a biting insect has come on her out of the north
 and those who were her fighters for payment are like fat oxen for they are turned back they have gone in flight together they do not keep their place for the day of their fate has come on them the time of their punishment
 she makes a sound like the hiss of a snake when they come on with strength they go against her with axes like wood cutters
 they will be cutting down her woods for they may not be searched out because they are like locusts more than may be numbered
 the daughter of egypt will be put to shame she will be given up into the hands of the people of the north
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send punishment on amon of no and on pharaoh and on those who put their faith in him
 and i will give them up into the hands of those who will take their lives and into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of his servants and later it will be peopled as in the past says the lord
 but have no fear o jacob my servant and do not be troubled o israel for see i will make you come back from far away and your seed from the land where they are prisoners and jacob will come back and will be quiet and in peace and no one will give him cause for fear
 have no fear o jacob my servant says the lord for i am with you for i will put an end to all the nations where i have sent you but i will not put an end to you completely though with wise purpose i will put right your errors and will not let you go quite without punishment

 this is what the lord has said see waters are coming up out of the north and will become an overflowing stream overflowing the land and everything in it the town and those who are living in it and men will give a cry and all the people of the land will be crying out in pain
 at the noise of the stamping of the feet of his war horses at the rushing of his carriages and the thunder of his wheels fathers will give no thought to their children because their hands are feeble
 because of the day which is coming with destruction on all the philistines cutting off from tyre and zidon the last of their helpers for the lord will send destruction on the philistines the rest of the sea land of caphtor
 the hair is cut off from the head of gaza ashkelon has come to nothing the last of the anakim are deeply wounding themselves
 o sword of the lord how long will you have no rest put yourself back into your cover be at peace be quiet
 how is it possible for it to be quiet seeing that the lord has given it orders against ashkelon and against the sea land he has given it directions
