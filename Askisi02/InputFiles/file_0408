 and more than this absalom said if only i was made judge in the land so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me and i would give a right decision for him 
 and if any man came near to give him honour he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss
 and this absalom did to everyone in israel who came to the king to have his cause judged so absalom like a thief took away the hearts of the men of israel
 now at the end of four years absalom said to the king let me go to hebron and give effect to the oath which i made to the lord
 for while i was living in geshur in aram your servant made an oath saying if ever the lord lets me come back to jerusalem i will give him worship in hebron
 and the king said to him go in peace so he got up and went to hebron
 but absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of israel to say at the sound of the horn you are to say absalom is king in hebron
 and with absalom at his request went two hundred men from jerusalem who were completely unconscious of his designs
 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite one of davids helpers from giloh his town while he was making the offerings and the design against david became strong for more and more people were joined to absalom
 and one came to david and said the hearts of the men of israel have gone after absalom
 and david said to all his servants who were with him at jerusalem come let us go in flight or not one of us will be safe from absalom let us go without loss of time or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us and put the town to the sword
 and the kings servants said to the king see your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done
 so the king went out taking with him all the people of his house but for ten of his women who were to take care of the house
 and the king went out and all his servants went after him and made a stop at the far house
 and all the people went on by his side and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the men of ittai of gath six hundred men who came after him from gath went on before the king
 then the king said to ittai the gittite why are you coming with us go back and keep with the king for you are a man of another country you are far from the land of your birth
 it was only yesterday you came to us why then am i to make you go up and down with us for i have to go where i may go back then and take your countrymen with you and may the lords mercy and good faith be with you
 and ittai the gittite in answer said by the living lord and by the life of my lord the king in whatever place my lord the king may be for life or death there will your servant be
 and david said to ittai go forward then and ittai the gittite went on with all his men and all the little ones he had with him
 and there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through and the king himself was waiting in the kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive tree on the edge of the waste land
 then zadok came and abiathar and with them the ark of gods agreement and they put down the ark of god till all the people from the town had gone by
 and the king said to zadok take the ark of god back into the town if i have grace in the eyes of the lord he will let me come back and see it and his house again
 but if he says i have no delight in you then here i am let him do to me what seems good to him
 the king said further to zadok the priest see you and abiathar are to go back to the town in peace with your two sons ahimaaz your son and jonathan the son of abiathar
 see i will be waiting at the way across the river in the waste land till i get news from you
 so zadok and abiathar took the ark of god back to jerusalem and did not go away from there
 and david went up the slopes of the mount of olives weeping all the way with his head covered and no shoes on his feet and all the people who were with him covering their heads went up weeping
 and word came to david saying ahithophel is among those who are joined to absalom and david said o lord let the wisdom of ahithophel be made foolish
 now when david had come to the top of the slope where they gave worship to god hushai the archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head
 david said to him if you go on with me you will be a trouble to me
