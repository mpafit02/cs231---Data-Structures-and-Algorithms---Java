 it is a true saying in which all may put their faith that christ jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners of whom i am the chief
 but for this reason i was given mercy so that in me the chief of sinners jesus christ might make clear all his mercy as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life
 now to the king eternal ever living unseen the only god be honour and glory for ever and ever so be it
 this order i give to you timothy my son in harmony with the words of the prophets about you so that by them you may be strong fighting the good fight
 keeping faith and being conscious of well doing for some by not doing these things have gone wrong in relation to the faith
 such are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have given up to satan so that they may say no more evil words against god
 my desire is first of all that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men
 for kings and all those in authority so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of god and serious behaviour
 this is good and pleasing in the eyes of god our saviour
 whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true
 for there is one god and one peacemaker between god and men the man christ jesus
 who gave himself as an offering for all witness of which was to be given at the right time
 and of this i became a preacher and an apostle  what i say is true not false  and a teacher of the gentiles in the true faith
 it is my desire then that in every place men may give themselves to prayer lifting up holy hands without wrath or argument
 and that women may be dressed in simple clothing with a quiet and serious air not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price
 but clothed with good works as is right for women who are living in the fear of god
 let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority
 in my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher or to have rule over a man but to be quiet
 for adam was first formed then eve
 and adam was not taken by deceit but the woman being tricked became a wrongdoer
 but if they go on in faith and love and holy self control she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth
 this is a true saying a man desiring the position of a bishop has a desire for a good work
 the bishop then is to be a man of good name the husband of one wife self controlled serious minded having respect for order opening his house freely to guests a ready teacher
 not quickly moved to wrath or blows but gentle no fighter no lover of money
 ruling his house well having his children under control with all serious behaviour
  for if a man has not the art of ruling his house how will he take care of the church of god 
 not one newly taken into the church for fear that through his high opinion of himself he may come into the same sin as the evil one
 and he is to have a good name among those outside the church so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the evil one
 deacons in the same way are to be serious in their behaviour not false in word not given to taking much wine or greatly desiring the wealth of this world
 keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin
