 for the lord says you were given for nothing and you will be made free without price
 for the lord god says my people went down at first into egypt to get a place for themselves there and the assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause
 now then what have i here says the lord for my people are taken away without cause they are made waste and give cries of sorrow says the lord and all the day the nations put shame on my name
 for this cause i will make my name clear to my people in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them see here am i
 how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news who gives word of peace saying that salvation is near who says to zion your god is ruling 
 the voice of your watchmen  their voices are loud in song together for they will see him eye to eye when the lord comes back to zion
 give sounds of joy make melody together waste places of jerusalem for the lord has given comfort to his people he has taken up the cause of jerusalem
 the lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our god
 away  away  go out from there touching no unclean thing go out from among her be clean you who take up the vessels of the lord
 for you will not go out suddenly and you will not go in flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will come after you to keep you
 see my servant will do well in his undertakings he will be honoured and lifted up and be very high
 as peoples were surprised at him and his face was not beautiful so as to be desired his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man and his form was no longer that of the sons of men
 so will nations give him honour kings will keep quiet because of him for what had not been made clear to them they will see and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears
 who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears and to whom had the arm of the lord been unveiled
 for his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him and like a root out of a dry place he had no grace of form to give us pleasure
 men made sport of him turning away from him he was a man of sorrows marked by disease and like one from whom mens faces are turned away he was looked down on and we put no value on him
 but it was our pain he took and our diseases were put on him while to us he seemed as one diseased on whom gods punishment had come
 but it was for our sins he was wounded and for our evil doings he was crushed he took the punishment by which we have peace and by his wounds we are made well
 we all went wandering like sheep going every one of us after his desire and the lord put on him the punishment of us all
 men were cruel to him but he was gentle and quiet as a lamb taken to its death and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound so he said not a word
 they took away from him help and right and who gave a thought to his fate for he was cut off from the land of the living he came to his death for the sin of my people
 and they put his body into the earth with sinners and his last resting place was with the evil doers though he had done no wrong and no deceit was in his mouth
 and the lord was pleased  see a seed long life  will do well in his hand 
  made clear his righteousness before men  had taken their sins on himself
 for this cause he will have a heritage with the great and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong because he gave up his life and was numbered with the evil doers taking on himself the sins of the people and making prayer for the wrongdoers
 let your voice be loud in song o woman without children make melody and sounds of joy you who did not give birth for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife says the lord
 make wide the place of your tent and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit make your cords long and your tent pins strong
 for i will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left and your seed will take the nations for a heritage and make the waste towns full of people
 have no fear for you will not be shamed or without hope you will not be put to shame for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years
 for your maker is your husband the lord of armies is his name and the holy one of israel is he who takes up your cause he will be named the god of all the earth
