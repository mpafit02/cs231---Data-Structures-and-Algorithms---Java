 but the feast of the jews the feast of tents was near
 so his brothers said to him go away from here into judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do
 because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him if you do these things let yourself be seen by all men
 for even his brothers had no belief in him
 jesus said to them my time is still to come but any time is good for you
 it is not possible for you to be hated by the world but i am hated by it because i give witness that what it does is evil
 go you up to the feast i am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come
 having said these things to them he still kept in galilee
 but after his brothers had gone up to the feast then he went up not publicly but in secret
 at the feast the jews were looking for him and saying where is he
 and there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people some said he is a good man but others said no he is giving people false ideas
 but no man said anything about him openly for fear of the jews
 now in the middle of the feast jesus went up to the temple and was teaching
 then the jews were surprised and said how has this man got knowledge of books he has never been to school
 jesus gave them this answer it is not my teaching but his who sent me
 if any man is ready to do gods pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes from  from god or from myself
 the man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him  that man is true and there is no evil in him
 did not moses give you the law even so not one of you keeps the law why have you a desire to put me to death
 the people said in answer you have an evil spirit who has any desire to put you to death
 this was the answer of jesus i have done one work and you are all surprised at it
 moses gave you circumcision  not that it comes from moses but from the fathers  and even on the sabbath you give a child circumcision
 if a child is given circumcision on the sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken why are you angry with me because i made a man completely well on the sabbath
 let not your decisions be based on what you see but on righteousness
 then some of the people of jerusalem said is not this the man whose death is desired
 and here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him  is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the christ
 however it is clear to us where this man comes from but when the christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from
 then when he was teaching in the temple jesus said with a loud voice you have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where i come from and i have not come of myself but there is one who has sent me he is true but you have no knowledge of him
 i have knowledge of him because i came from him and he sent me
 then they had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come
 and numbers of the people had belief in him and they said when the christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done
