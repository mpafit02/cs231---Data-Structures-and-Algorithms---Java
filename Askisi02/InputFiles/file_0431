 so i was by myself and i saw this great vision and all my strength went from me and the colour went from my face
 but the sound of his words came to my ears and on hearing his voice i went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth
 then a hand gave me a touch awaking me and putting me on my knees and my hands
 and he said to me o daniel you man dearly loved take in the sense of the words i say to you and get up on to your feet for to you i am now sent and when he had said this to me i got on to my feet shaking with fear
 then he said to me have no fear daniel for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your god your words have come to his ears and i have come because of your words
 but the angel of the kingdom of persia put himself against me for twenty one days but michael one of the chief angels came to my help and when i came he was still there with the angel of the kings of persia
 now i have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days for there is still a vision for the days
 and after he had said these words to me i kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything
 then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips and opening my mouth i said to him who was before me o my lord because of the vision my pains have come on me and i have no more strength
 for how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord for as for me straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body
 then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength
 and he said to me o man greatly loved have no fear peace be with you be strong and let your heart be lifted up and at his words i became strong and said let my lord say on for you have given me strength
 then he said it is clear to you why i have come to you and now i will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings
 but i am going back to make war with the angel of persia and when i am gone the angel of greece will come and there is no one on my side against these but michael your angel
 and as for me in the first year of darius the mede i was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong
 and now i will make clear to you what is true there are still three kings to come in persia and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them and when he has become strong through his wealth he will put his forces in motion against all the kingdoms of greece
 and a strong king will come to power ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure
 and when he has become strong his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven but not to his offspring for it will be uprooted and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these but not with the same authority as his
 and the king of the south will be strong but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler and his rule will be a great rule
 and at the end of years they will be joined together and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she will not keep the strength of her arm and his offspring will not keep their place but she will be uprooted with those who were the cause of her coming and her son and he who took her in those times
 but out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place who will come against the army forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north and he will take them in hand and overcome them
 and their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north
 and he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south but he will go back to his land
 and his son will make war and will get together an army of great forces and he will make an attack on him overflowing and going past and he will again take the war even to his strong place
 and the king of the south will be moved with wrath and will come out and make war on him on this same king of the north and he will get together a great army but the army will be given into his hand
 and the army will be taken away and his heart will be uplifted he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands but he will not be strong
 and again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first and he will make an attack on him at the end of years with a great army and much wealth
 in those times a number will take up arms against the king of the south and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true but it will be their downfall
 so the king of the north will come and put up earthworks and take a well armed town and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position even the best of his army but they will not have strength to do so
 and he who comes against him will do his pleasure and no one will be able to keep his place before him he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction
