 and this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains and the king did as memucan said
 and sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people
 and king ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea
 and all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave mordecai are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of media and persia
 for mordecai the jew was second only to king ahasuerus and great among the jews and respected by the body of his countrymen working for the good of his people and saying words of peace to all his seed
 after these things when the kings feelings were calmer the thought of vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her came back to his mind
 then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him let search be made for some fair young virgins for the king
 let the king give authority to certain men in all the divisions of his kingdom to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to shushan the kings town to the womens house under the care of hegai the kings servant the keeper of the women and let the things needed for making them clean be given to them
 and let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of vashti and the king was pleased with this suggestion and he did so
 now there was a certain jew in shushan named mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite
 who had been taken away from jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with jeconiah king of judah when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had taken him away
 and he had been a father to hadassah that is esther the daughter of his fathers brother for she had no father or mother and she was very beautiful and when her father and mother were dead mordecai took her for his daughter
 so when the order made by the king was publicly given out and a number of girls had been placed in the care of hegai in the kings house in shushan esther was taken into the kings house and put in the care of hegai the keeper of the women
 and he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean and the things which were hers by right and seven servant girls who were to be hers from the kings house and he had her and her servant girls moved to the best place in the womens part of the house
 esther had not said what family or people she came from for mordecai had given her orders not to do so
 and every day mordecai took his walk before the square of the womens house to see how esther was and what would be done to her
 now every girl when her turn came had to go in to king ahasuerus after undergoing for a space of twelve months what was ordered by the law for the women  for this was the time necessary for making them clean that is six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean 
 and in this way the girl went in to the king whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her from the womens house into the house of the king
 in the evening she went and on the day after she came back to the second house of the women into the keeping of shaashgaz one of the kings unsexed servants who had the care of the kings wives only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by name did she go in to him again
 now when the time came for esther the daughter of abihail his fathers brother whom mordecai had taken as his daughter to go in to the king she made request for nothing but what hegai the kings servant and keeper of the women had given her and esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her
 so esther was taken in to king ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his rule
 and esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of vashti
 then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants even esthers feast and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work and gave wealth from his store
 and when the virgins came together in the second house of the women mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the kings house
 esther had still said nothing of her family or her people as mordecai had given her orders for esther did what mordecai said as when she was living with him
 in those days while mordecai was seated at the kings doorway two of the kings servants bigthan and teresh keepers of the door being angry were looking for a chance to make an attack on king ahasuerus
 and mordecai having knowledge of their purpose sent word of it to esther the queen and esther gave the news to the king in mordecais name
 and when the thing had been looked into it was seen to be true and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree and it was put down in the records before the king
 after these things by the order of the king haman the son of hammedatha the agagite was lifted up and given a position of honour and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him
 and all the kings servants who were in the kings house went down to the earth before haman and gave him honour for so the king had given orders but mordecai did not go down before him or give him honour
