 but because of david the lord gave him a light in jerusalem making his sons king after him so that jerusalem might be safe
 because david did what was right in the eyes of the lord and never in all his life went against his orders but only in the question of uriah the hittite
 
 now the rest of the acts of abijam and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam
 then abijam went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of david and asa his son became king in his place
 in the twentieth year that jeroboam was king of israel asa became king over judah
 and he was king for forty one years in jerusalem his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom
 asa did what was right in the eyes of the lord as david his father did
 those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country and he took away all the images which his fathers had made
 and he would not let maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for asherah and asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream kidron
 the high places however were not taken away but still the heart of asa was true to the lord all his life
 he took into the house of the lord all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
 now there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
 and baasha king of israel went up against judah building ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to asa king of judah
 then asa took all the silver and gold which was still stored in the lords house and in the kings house and sent them in the care of his servants to ben hadad son of tabrimmon son of rezon king of aram at damascus saying
 let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see i have sent you an offering of silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with baasha king of israel so that he may give up attacking me
 so ben hadad did as king asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of israel attacking ijon and dan and abel beth maacah and all chinneroth as far as all the land of naphtali
 and baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of ramah and was living in tirzah
 then king asa got all judah together making every man come and they took away the stones and the wood with which baasha was building ramah and king asa made use of them for building geba in the land of benjamin and mizpah
 now the rest of the acts of asa and his power and all he did and the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah but when he was old he had a disease of the feet
 so asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and jehoshaphat his son became king in his place
 nadab the son of jeroboam became king over israel in the second year that asa was king of judah and he was king of israel for two years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the evil ways of his father and the sin which he did and made israel do
 and baasha the son of ahijah of the family of issachar made a secret design against him attacking him at gibbethon a town of the philistines for nadab and the armies of israel were making war on gibbethon
 in the third year of the rule of asa king of judah baasha put him to death and became king in his place
 and straight away when he became king he sent destruction on all the offspring of jeroboam there was not one living person of all the family of jeroboam whom he did not put to death so the word of the lord which he said by his servant ahijah the shilonite came about
 because of the sins which jeroboam did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath
 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
 in the third year of the rule of asa king of judah baasha the son of ahijah became king over all israel in tirzah and was king for twenty four years
