 being named by god a high priest of the order of melchizedek
 of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear because you are slow of hearing
 and though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of gods revelation you have become like babies who have need of milk and not of solid food
 for everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness he is a child
 but solid food is for men of full growth even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil
 for this reason let us go on from the first things about christ to full growth not building again that on which it is based that is the turning of the heart from dead works and faith in god
 the teaching of baptisms and of the putting on of hands and of the future life of the dead and of the judging on the last day
 now we will do this if god lets us
 as for those who at one time saw the light tasting the good things from heaven and having their part in the holy spirit
 with knowledge of the good word of god and of the powers of the coming time
 and then let themselves be turned away it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time because they themselves put the son of god on the cross again openly shaming him
 for a land drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked has a blessing from god
 but if it sends up thorns and evil plants it is of no use and is ready to be cursed its only end is to be burned
 but my loved ones though we say this we are certain that you have better things in you things which go with salvation
 for god is true and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name in the help which you gave and still give to the saints
 and it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end
 so that you may not be slow in heart but may take as your example those to whom god has given their heritage because of their faith and their long waiting
 for when god made his oath to abraham because there was no greater oath he made it by himself
 saying be certain that i will give you my blessing and make your numbers very great
 and so when he had been waiting calmly for a long time gods word to him was put into effect
 for men at all times make their oaths by what is greater and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath
 so that when it was gods desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage that his purpose was fixed he made it more certain with an oath
 so that we who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things in which it is not possible for god to be false
 and this hope is like a strong band for our souls fixed and certain and going in to that which is inside the veil
 where jesus has gone before us as a high priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 for this melchizedek the king of salem a priest of the most high god who gave abraham his blessing meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death
 and to whom abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had being first named king of righteousness and then in addition king of salem that is to say king of peace
 being without father or mother or family having no birth or end to his life being made like the son of god is a priest for ever
 now see how great this man was to whom our father abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight
 and it is true that by the law those of the sons of levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the peoples goods that is to say they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of abraham
