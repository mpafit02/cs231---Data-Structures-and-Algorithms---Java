 and hannah in prayer before the lord said my heart is glad in the lord my horn is lifted up in the lord my mouth is open wide over my haters because my joy is in your salvation
 no other is holy as the lord for there is no other god but you there is no rock like our god
 say no more words of pride let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths for the lord is a god of knowledge by him acts are judged
 the bows of the men of war are broken and the feeble are clothed with strength
 those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread those who were in need are at rest truly she who had no children has become the mother of seven and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow
 the lord is the giver of death and life sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up
 the lord gives wealth and takes a mans goods from him crushing men down and again lifting them up
 lifting the poor out of the dust and him who is in need out of the lowest place to give them their place among rulers and for their heritage the seat of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he has made them the base of the world
 he will keep the feet of his holy ones but the evil doers will come to their end in the dark night for by strength no man will overcome
 those who make war against the lord will be broken against them he will send his thunder from heaven the lord will be judge of the ends of the earth he will give strength to his king lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put
 then elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child became the servant of the lord under the direction of eli the priest
 now the sons of eli were evil and good for nothing men having no knowledge of the lord
 and the priests way with the people was this when any man made an offering the priests servant came while the flesh was being cooked having in his hand a meat hook with three teeth
 this he put into the pot and everything which came up on the hook the priest took for himself this they did in shiloh to all the israelites who came there
 and more than this before the fat was burned the priests servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest he has no taste for meat cooked in water but would have you give it uncooked
 and if the man said to him first let the fat be burned then take as much as you will then the servant would say no you are to give it to me now or i will take it by force
 and the sin of these young men was very great before the lord for they gave no honour to the lords offerings
 but samuel did the work of the lords house while he was a child dressed in a linen ephod
 and his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came with her husband for the years offering
 and every year eli gave elkanah and his wife a blessing saying may the lord give you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the lord and they went back to their house
 and the lord had mercy on hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two daughters and the young samuel became older before the lord
 now eli was very old and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all israel
 and he said to them why are you doing such things for from all this people i get accounts of your evil ways
 no my sons the account which is given me which the lords people are sending about is not good
 if one man does wrong to another god will be his judge but if a mans sin is against the lord who will take up his cause but they gave no attention to the voice of their father for it was the lords purpose to send destruction on them
 and the young samuel becoming older had the approval of the lord and of men
 and a man of god came to eli and said to him the lord says did i let myself be seen by your fathers people when they were in egypt servants in pharaohs house
 did i take him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod did i give to your fathers family all the offerings made by fire by the children of israel
 why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which were ordered by my word honouring your sons before me and making yourselves fat with all the best of the offerings of israel my people
 for this reason the lord god of israel has said truly i did say that your family and your fathers people would have their place before me for ever but now the lord says let it not be so i will give honour to those by whom i am honoured and those who have no respect for me will be of small value in my eyes
