 and the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth but he would not and he would not take food with them
 and then on the seventh day the childs death took place and davids servants were in fear of giving him the news of the childs death for they said truly while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead
 but when david saw that his servants were talking together quietly he was certain that the child was dead and he said to his servants is the child dead and they said he is
 then david got up from the earth and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing he went into the house of the lord and gave worship then he went back to his house and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal
 then his servants said to him why have you been acting in this way you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living but when the child was dead you got up and had a meal
 and he said while the child was still living i went without food and gave myself up to weeping for i said who is able to say that the lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life
 but now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food am i able to make him come back to life i will go to him but he will never come back to me
 and david gave comfort to his wife bath sheba and he went in to her and had connection with her and she had a son to whom she gave the name solomon and he was dear to the lord
 and he sent word by nathan the prophet who gave him the name jedidiah by the word of the lord
 now joab was fighting against rabbah in the land of the children of ammon and he took the water town
 and joab sent men to david saying i have made war against rabbah and have taken the water town
 so now get the rest of the people together and put them in position against the town and take it for if i take it it will be named after my name
 then david got all the people together and went to rabbah and made war on it and took it
 and he took the crown of milcom from his head the weight of it was a talent of gold and in it were stones of great price and it was put on davids head and he took a great store of goods from the town
 and he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood cutting instruments and iron grain crushers and iron axes and at brick making this he did to all the towns of the children of ammon then david and all the people went back to jerusalem
 now after this it came about that absalom davids son had a beautiful sister whose name was tamar and davids son amnon was in love with her
 and he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and so it seemed hard to amnon to do anything to her
 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very wise man
 and he said to him o son of the king why are you getting thinner day by day will you not say what your trouble is and amnon said to him i am in love with tamar my brother absaloms sister
 then jonadab said to him go to your bed and let it seem that you are ill and when your father comes to see you say to him let my sister tamar come and give me bread and get the food ready before my eyes so that i may see it and take it from her hand
 so amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill and when the king came to see him amnon said to the king please let my sister tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes so that i may take food from her hand
 then david sent to the house for tamar and said go now to your brother amnons house and get a meal for him
 so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was in bed and she took paste and made cakes before his eyes cooking them over the fire
 and she took the cooking pot and put the cakes before him but he would not take them and amnon said let everyone go away from me so they all went out
 then amnon said to tamar take the food and come into my bedroom so that i may take it from your hand so tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother amnons bedroom
 and when she took them to give them to him he put his arms round her and said come to bed my sister
 and answering him she said o my brother do not put shame on me it is not right for such a thing to be done in israel do not this evil thing
 what will become of me in my shame and as for you you will be looked down on with disgust by all israel now then go and make your request to the king for he will not keep me from you
 but he would not give attention to what she said but being stronger than she he took her by force and had connection with her
 then amnon was full of hate for her hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her and he said to her get up and be gone
