 make your way about zion and go round it numbering its towers
 take note of its strong walls looking well at its fair buildings so that you may give word of it to the generation which comes after
 because this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide
 &ltalamoth to the chief music maker of the sons of korah a psalm&gt give attention to this all you peoples let your ears be open all you who are living in the world
 high and low together the poor and those who have wealth
 from my mouth will come words of wisdom and in the thoughts of my heart will be knowledge
 i will put my teaching into a story i will make my dark sayings clear with music
 what cause have i for fear in the days of evil when the evil doing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me
 even of those whose faith is in their wealth and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores
 truly no man may get back his soul for a price or give to god the payment for himself
  because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death and man is not able to give it 
 so that he might have eternal life and never see the underworld
 for he sees that wise men come to their end and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together letting their wealth go to others
 the place of the dead is their house for ever and their resting place through all generations those who come after them give their names to their lands
 but man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
 this is the way of the foolish their silver is for those who come after them and their children get the pleasure of their gold  selah 
 death will give them their food like sheep the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it their flesh is food for worms their form is wasted away the underworld is their resting place for ever
 but god will get back my soul for he will take me from the power of death  selah 
 have no fear when wealth comes to a man and the glory of his house is increased
 for at his death he will take nothing away his glory will not go down after him
 though he might have pride in his soul in his life time and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself
 he will go to the generation of his fathers he will not see the light again
 man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
 &ltto the chief music maker on wind instruments a psalm of david&gt give ear to my words o lord give thought to my heart searchings
 let the voice of my cry come to you my king and my god for to you will i make my prayer
 my voice will come to you in the morning o lord in the morning will i send my prayer to you and keep watch
 for you are not a god who takes pleasure in wrongdoing there is no evil with you
 the sons of pride have no place before you you are a hater of all workers of evil
 you will send destruction on those whose words are false the cruel man and the man of deceit are hated by the lord
 but as for me i will come into your house in the full measure of your mercy and in your fear i will give worship turning my eyes to your holy temple
