 he who is quickly angry will do what is foolish but the man of good sense will have quiet
 foolish behaviour is the heritage of the simple but men of good sense are crowned with knowledge
 the knees of the evil are bent before the good and sinners go down in the dust at the doors of the upright
 the poor man is hated even by his neighbour but the man of wealth has numbers of friends
 he who has no respect for his neighbour is a sinner but he who has pity for the poor is happy
 will not the designers of evil come into error but mercy and good faith are for the designers of good
 in all hard work there is profit but talk only makes a man poor
 their wisdom is a crown to the wise but their foolish behaviour is round the head of the unwise
 a true witness is the saviour of lives but he who says false things is a cause of deceit
 for him in whose heart is the fear of the lord there is strong hope and his children will have a safe place
 the fear of the lord is a fountain of life by which one may be turned from the nets of death
 a kings glory is in the number of his people and for need of people a ruler may come to destruction
 he who is slow to be angry has great good sense but he whose spirit is over quick gives support to what is foolish
 a quiet mind is the life of the body but envy is a disease in the bones
 he who is hard on the poor puts shame on his maker but he who has mercy on those who are in need gives him honour
 the sinner is overturned in his evil doing but the upright man has hope in his righteousness
 wisdom has her resting place in the mind of the wise but she is not seen among the foolish
 by righteousness a nation is lifted up but sin is a cause of shame to the peoples
 the king has pleasure in a servant who does wisely but his wrath is against him who is a cause of shame
 by a soft answer wrath is turned away but a bitter word is a cause of angry feelings
 knowledge is dropping from the tongue of the wise but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words
 the eyes of the lord are in every place keeping watch on the evil and the good
 a comforting tongue is a tree of life but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit
 a foolish man puts no value on his fathers training but he who has respect for teaching has good sense
 in the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble
 the lips of the wise keep knowledge but the heart of the foolish man is not right
 the offering of the evil doer is disgusting to the lord but the prayer of the upright man is his delight
 the way of the evil doer is disgusting to the lord but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him
 there is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching
 before the lord are the underworld and destruction how much more then the hearts of the children of men
