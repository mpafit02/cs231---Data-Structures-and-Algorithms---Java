 a mans pride will be the cause of his fall but he who has a gentle spirit will get honour
 a man who takes part with a thief has hate for his soul he is put under oath but says nothing
 the fear of man is a cause of danger but whoever puts his faith in the lord will have a safe place on high
 the approval of a ruler is desired by great numbers but the decision in a mans cause comes from the lord
 an evil man is disgusting to the upright and he who is upright is disgusting to evil doers
 my son keep my teaching in your memory and my rules in your heart
 for they will give you increase of days years of life and peace
 let not mercy and good faith go from you let them be hanging round your neck recorded on your heart
 so you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of god and men
 put all your hope in god not looking to your reason for support
 in all your ways give ear to him and he will make straight your footsteps
 put no high value on your wisdom let the fear of the lord be before you and keep yourself from evil
 this will give strength to your flesh and new life to your bones
 give honour to the lord with your wealth and with the first fruits of all your increase
 so your store houses will be full of grain and your vessels overflowing with new wine
 my son do not make your heart hard against the lords teaching do not be made angry by his training
 for to those who are dear to him the lord says sharp words and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain
 happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom and he who gets knowledge
 for trading in it is better than trading in silver and its profit greater than bright gold
 she is of more value than jewels and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her
 long life is in her right hand and in her left are wealth and honour
 her ways are ways of delight and all her goings are peace
 she is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands and happy is everyone who keeps her
 the lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth by reason he put the heavens in their place
 by his knowledge the deep was parted and dew came dropping from the skies
 my son keep good sense and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes
 so they will be life for your soul and grace for your neck
 then you will go safely on your way and your feet will have no cause for slipping
 when you take your rest you will have no fear and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you
 have no fear of sudden danger or of the storm which will come on evil doers
