 and the servant said if by chance the woman will not come with me into this land am i to take your son back again to the land from which you came
 and abraham said take care that you do not let my son go back to that land
 the lord god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth and made an oath to me saying to your seed i will give this land he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land
 and if the woman will not come with you then you are free from this oath only do not take my son back there
 and the servant put his hand under abrahams leg and gave him his oath about this thing
 and the servant took ten of his masters camels and all sorts of good things of his masters and went to mesopotamia to the town of nahor
 and he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water spring in the evening at the time when the women came to get water
 and he said o lord the god of my master abraham let me do well in what i have undertaken this day and give your mercy to my master abraham
 see i am waiting here by the water spring and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water
 now may the girl to whom i say let down your vessel and give me a drink and who says in answer here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels may she be the one marked out by you for your servant isaac so may i be certain that you have been good to my master abraham
 and even before his words were ended rebekah the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah who was the wife of nahor abrahams brother came out with her water vessel on her arm
 she was a very beautiful girl a virgin who had never been touched by a man and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel
 and the servant came running to her and said give me a little water from your vessel
 and she said take a drink my lord and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand she gave him a drink
 and having done so she said i will get water for your camels till they have had enough
 and after putting the water from her vessel into the animals drinking place she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels
 and the man looking at her said nothing waiting to see if the lord had given his journey a good outcome
 and when the camels had had enough the man took a gold nose ring half a shekel in weight and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold
 and said to her whose daughter are you is there room in your fathers house for us
 and she said to him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah nahors wife
 and she said we have a great store of dry grass and cattle food and there is room for you
 and with bent head the man gave worship to the lord
 and said praise be to the lord the god of my master abraham who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master by guiding me straight to the house of my masters family
 so the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mothers house
 now rebekah had a brother named laban and he came out quickly to the man at the water spring
 and when he saw the nose ring and the ornaments on his sisters hands and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water spring
 and he said to him come in you on whom is the blessing of the lord why are you waiting outside for i have made the house ready for you and a place for the camels
 then the man came into the house and laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet
 and meat was put before him but he said i will not take food till i have made my business clear to you and they said do so
 and he said i am abrahams servant
