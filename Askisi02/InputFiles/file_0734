 he does not get wealth for himself and is unable to keep what he has got the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth
 he does not come out of the dark his branches are burned by the flame and the wind takes away his bud
 let him not put his hope in what is false falling into error for he will get deceit as his reward
 his branch is cut off before its time and his leaf is no longer green
 he is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth or an olive tree dropping its flowers
 for the band of the evil doers gives no fruit and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire
 evil has made them with child and they give birth to trouble and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves
 and job made answer and said
 such things have frequently come to my ears you are comforters who only give trouble
 may words which are like the wind be stopped or what is troubling you to make answer to them
 it would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my souls place joining words together against you and shaking my head at you
 i might give you strength with my mouth and not keep back the comfort of my lips
 if i say what is in my mind my pain becomes no less and if i keep quiet how much of it goes from me
 but now he has overcome me with weariness and fear and i am in the grip of all my trouble
 it has come up as a witness against me and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face
 i am broken by his wrath and his hate has gone after me he has made his teeth sharp against me my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes
 their mouths are open wide against me the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face all of them come together in a mass against me
 god gives me over to the power of sinners sending me violently into the hands of evil doers
 i was in comfort but i have been broken up by his hands he has taken me by the neck shaking me to bits he has put me up as a mark for his arrows
 his bowmen come round about me their arrows go through my body without mercy my life is drained out on the earth
 i am broken with wound after wound he comes rushing on me like a man of war
 i have made haircloth the clothing of my skin and my horn is rolled in the dust
 my face is red with weeping and my eyes are becoming dark
 though my hands have done no violent acts and my prayer is clean
 o earth let not my blood be covered and let my cry have no resting place 
 even now my witness is in heaven and the supporter of my cause is on high
 my friends make sport of me to god my eyes are weeping
 so that he may give decision for a man in his cause with god and between a son of man and his neighbour
 for in a short time i will take the journey from which i will not come back
 my spirit is broken my days are ended the last resting place is ready for me
