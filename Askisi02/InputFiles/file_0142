 but be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
 so be ready for the son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him
 and peter said to him lord are these words said to us only or to all men
 and the lord said who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family to give them their food at the right time
 happy is that servant who when his lord comes is doing so
 truly i say to you he will put him in control of all his goods
 but if that servant says to himself my lord is a long time coming and goes about giving blows to the men servants and the women servants feasting and taking overmuch wine
 the lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him and at an hour when he is not ready for him and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith
 and the servant who had knowledge of his lords desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered will be given a great number of blows
 but he who without knowledge did things for which punishment is given will get only a small number of blows the man to whom much is given will have to give much if much is given into his care of him more will be requested

 o false ones  the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you
 and why are you in your hearts unable to be judges of what is right
 for if anyone has a cause at law against you and you are going with him before the ruler make an attempt on the way to come to an agreement with him for if you do not he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police and they will put you in prison
 i say to you you will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing
 now some people who were there at that time gave him an account of how the blood of some galilaeans had been mixed by pilate with their offerings
 and he in answer said to them are you of the opinion that these galilaeans were worse than all other galilaeans because these things were done to them
 i say to you it is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to the same end
 or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of siloam were they worse than all the other men living in jerusalem
 i say to you it is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to an end in the same way
 and he made up this story for them a certain man had a fig tree in his garden and he came to get fruit from it and there was no fruit
