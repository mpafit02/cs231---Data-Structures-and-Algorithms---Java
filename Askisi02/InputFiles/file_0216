 let not him who is on the house top go down to take anything out of his house
 and let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat
 but it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days
 and say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter or on a sabbath
 because in those days there will be great sorrow such as there has not been from the start of the world till now or ever will be
 and if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any but because of the saints those days will be made short
 then if any man says to you see here is the christ or here do not put faith in him
 for there will come up false christs and false prophets who will do great signs and wonders so that if possible even the saints might be tricked
 see i have made it clear to you before it comes about
 if then they say to you see he is in the waste land go not out see he is in the inner rooms put no faith in it
 because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west so will be the coming of the son of man
 wherever the dead body is there will the eagles come together
 but straight away after the trouble of those days the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved
 and then the sign of the son of man will be seen in heaven and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
 and he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn and they will get his saints together from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
 now take an example from the fig tree when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves you are certain that the summer is near
 even so when you see all these things you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
 truly i say to you this generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
 heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
 but of that day and hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the son but the father only
 and as were the days of noah so will be the coming of the son of man
 because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters they were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day when noah went into the ark
 and they had no care till the waters came and took them all away so will be the coming of the son of man
 then two men will be in the field one is taken and one let go
 two women will be crushing grain one is taken and one let go
 be watching then  for you have no knowledge on what day your lord will come
 but be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
 be ready then for at a time which you have no thought of the son of man will come
 who is the true and wise servant whom his lord has put over those in his house to give them their food at the right time
 a blessing on that servant who will be doing so when his lord comes
