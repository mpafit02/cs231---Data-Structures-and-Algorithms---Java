 the god of this people israel made selection of our fathers lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of egypt and with a strong arm took them out of it
 and for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land
 and having put to destruction seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years
 and after these things he gave them judges till the time of samuel the prophet
 then at their request for a king god gave them saul the son of kish a man of the family of benjamin who was their king for forty years
 and having put him on one side he made david their king to whom he gave witness saying i have taken david the son of jesse a man dear to my heart who will do all my pleasure
 from this mans seed has god given to israel a saviour even jesus as he gave his word
 for whose coming john made ready the way by preaching to all the people of israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart
 and when john was completing his work he said what do i seem to you to be i am not he but one is coming after me whose shoes i am not good enough to undo
 my brothers children of the family of abraham and those among you who have the fear of god to us the word of this salvation is sent
 for the men of jerusalem and their rulers having no knowledge of him or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every sabbath day gave effect to them by judging him
 and though no cause of death was seen in him they made a request to pilate that he might be put to death
 and when they had done all the things said in the writings about him they took him down from the tree and put him in the place of the dead
 but god gave him back from the dead
 and for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from galilee to jerusalem who are now his witnesses before the people
 and we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers
 which god has now put into effect for our children by sending jesus as it says in the second psalm you are my son this day i have given you being
 and about his coming back from the dead never again to go to destruction he has said these words i will give you the holy and certain mercies of david
 because he says in another psalm you will not let your holy one see destruction
 now david having done gods work for his generation went to sleep and was put with his fathers and his body came to destruction
 but he who was lifted up by god did not see destruction
 and so let it be clear to you my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you
 and through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things from which the law of moses was not able to make you free
 so take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you
 see you doubters have wonder and come to your end for i will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief even if it is made clear to you
 and when they went out they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the sabbath after
 now when the meeting was ended a number of the jews and of the god fearing gentiles who had become jews went after paul and barnabas who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of god
 and on the sabbath after almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of god
 but when the jews saw such a great number of people they were full of envy and said evil words against pauls preaching
 then paul and barnabas without fear said it was necessary for the word of god to be given to you first but because you will have nothing to do with it and have no desire for eternal life it will now be offered to the gentiles
