 but the lord was kind to them and had pity on them caring for them because of his agreement with abraham isaac and jacob he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now
 then hazael king of aram came to his end and ben hadad his son became king in his place
 and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again from ben hadad the son of hazael the towns which he had taken from jehoahaz his father in war three times jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of israel
 in the second year of joash son of joahaz king of israel amaziah the son of joash became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was jehoaddin of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord though not like david his father he did as joash his father had done
 but still the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 now when he became strong in the kingdom straight away he put to death those servants who had taken the life of the king his father
 but he did not put their children to death for the orders of the lord recorded in the book of the law of moses say the fathers are not to be put to death for the children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
 he put to the sword twelve thousand men of edom in the valley of salt and took sela in war naming it joktheel as it is to this day
 then amaziah sent representatives to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us have a meeting face to face
 and jehoash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thorn tree in lebanon sent to the cedar in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
 it is true that you have overcome edom and your heart is uplifted let that glory be enough for you and keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and judah with you in danger of downfall
 but amaziah gave no attention so jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah came face to face at beth shemesh which is in judah
 and judah was overcome before israel so that they went in flight every man to his tent
 and jehoash king of israel made amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash son of ahaziah prisoner at beth shemesh and came to jerusalem and had the wall of jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of ephraim to the door in the angle four hundred cubits
 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the lord and in the store house of the king together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to samaria
 now the rest of the acts of jehoash and his power and how he went to war with amaziah king of judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehoash went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son became king in his place
 amaziah the son of joash king of judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel
 and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 now they made a secret design against him in jerusalem and he went in flight to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and put him to death there
 and they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in jerusalem the town of david
 then all the people of judah took azariah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father amaziah
 he was the builder of elath which he got back for judah after the death of the king
 in the fifteenth year of the rule of amaziah son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel became king in samaria ruling for forty one years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning away from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 he got back the old limits of israel from the way into hamath to the sea of the arabah as the lord had said by his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet of gath hepher
 for the lord saw how bitter was the trouble of israel and that everyone was cut off he who was shut up and he who went free and that israel had no helper
 and the lord had not said that the name of israel was to be taken away from the earth but he gave them a saviour in jeroboam the son of joash
