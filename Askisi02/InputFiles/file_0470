 give honour to your father and your mother as you have been ordered by the lord your god so that your life may be long and all may be well for you in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 do not put anyone to death without cause
 do not be false to the married relation
 do not take the property of another
 do not give false witness against your neighbour
 or let your desire be turned to your neighbours wife or his house or his field or his man servant or his woman servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is your neighbours
 these words the lord said to all of you together on the mountain out of the heart of the fire out of the cloud and the dark with a great voice and he said no more he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me
 and after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me
 and said the lord has let us see his glory and his power and his voice has come to us out of the fire today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of god
 why then is death to be our fate for if the voice of the lord our god comes to us any more death will overtake us and we will be burned up in this great fire
 for what man is there in all the earth who hearing the voice of the living god as we have out of the heart of the fire has been kept from death
 do you go near and after hearing everything which the lord our god has to say give us an account of all he has said to you and we will give ear and do it
 then the lord hearing your words to me said to me the words which this people have said to you have come to my ears what they have said is well said
 if only they had such a heart in them at all times so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever 
 now say to them go back to your tents
 but as for you keep your place here by me and i will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them so that they may do them in the land which i am giving them for their heritage
 take care then to do whatever the lord your god has given you orders to do let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left
 go on walking in the way ordered for you by the lord your god so that life may be yours and it may be well for you and your days may be long in the land of your heritage
 now these are the orders and the laws and the decisions which the lord your god gave me for your teaching so that you might do them in the land of your heritage to which you are going
 so that living in the fear of the lord your god you may keep all his laws and his orders which i give you you and your son and your sons son all the days of your life and so that your life may be long
 so give ear o israel and take care to do this so that it may be well for you and you may be greatly increased as the lord the god of your fathers has given you his word in a land flowing with milk and honey
 give ear o israel the lord our god is one lord
 and the lord your god is to be loved with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength
 keep these words which i say to you this day deep in your hearts
 teaching them to your children with all care talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
 let them be fixed as a sign on your hand and marked on your brow
 have them lettered on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
 and when the lord your god has taken you into the land which he gave his oath to your fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob that he would give you with great and fair towns which were not of your building
 and houses full of good things not stored up by you and places for storing water which you did not make and vine gardens and olive trees not of your planting and you have taken food and are full
 then take care that you keep your hearts true to the lord who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
