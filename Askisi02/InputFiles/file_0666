 with part of it he makes a fire and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal he makes himself warm and says aha  i am warm i have seen the fire
 and the rest of it he makes into a god even his pictured image he goes down on his face before it giving worship to it and making prayer to it saying be my saviour for you are my god
 they have no knowledge or wisdom for he has put a veil over their eyes so that they may not see and on their hearts so that they may not give attention
 and no one takes note no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say i have put part of it in the fire and made bread on it i have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it and am i now to make the rest of it into a false god am i to go down on my face before a bit of wood
 as for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying what i have here in my hand is false
 keep these things in mind o jacob and you israel for you are my servant i have made you you are my servant o israel i will not let you go out of my memory
 i have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud and your sins like a mist come back to me for i have taken up your cause
 make a song o heavens for the lord has done it give a loud cry you deep parts of the earth let your voices be loud in song you mountains and you woods with all your trees for the lord has taken up the cause of jacob and will let his glory be seen in israel
 the lord who has taken up your cause and who gave you life in your mothers body says i am the lord who makes all things stretching out the heavens by myself and giving the earth its limits who was with me
 who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads turning the wise men back and making their knowledge foolish
 who makes the word of his servants certain and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives who says of jerusalem her people will come back to her and of the towns of judah i will give orders for their building and will make her waste places fertile again
 who says to the deep be dry and i will make your rivers dry
 who says of cyrus he will take care of my sheep and will do all my pleasure who says of jerusalem i will give the word for your building and of the temple your bases will be put in place
 the lord says to the man of his selection to cyrus whom i have taken by the right hand putting down nations before him and taking away the arms of kings making the doors open before him so that the ways into the towns may not be shut
 i will go before you and make the rough places level the doors of brass will be broken and the iron rods cut in two
 and i will give you the stores of the dark and the wealth of secret places so that you may be certain that i am the lord who gave you your name even the god of israel
 because of jacob my servant and israel whom i have taken for myself i have sent for you by name giving you a name of honour though you had no knowledge of me
 i am the lord and there is no other there is no god but me i will make you ready for war though you had no knowledge of me
 so that they may see from the east and from the west that there is no god but me i am the lord and there is no other
 i am the giver of light and the maker of the dark causing blessing and sending troubles i am the lord who does all these things
 let righteousness come down o heavens from on high and let the sky send it down like rain let the earth be open to give the fruit of salvation causing righteousness to come up with it i the lord have made it come about
 cursed is he who has an argument with his maker the pot which has an argument with the potter  will the wet earth say to him who is working with it what are you doing that your work has nothing by which it may be gripped
 cursed is he who says to a father to what are you giving life or to a woman what are you in birth pains with
 the lord the holy one of israel and his maker says will you put a question to me about the things which are to come or will you give me orders about my sons and the work of my hands
 i have made the earth forming man on it by my hands the heavens have been stretched out and all the stars put in their ordered places
 i have sent him out to overcome the nations and i will make all his ways straight i will give him the work of building my town and he will let my prisoners go free without price or reward says the lord of armies
 the lord says the workmen of egypt and the traders of ethiopia and the tall sabaeans will come over the sea to you and they will be yours they will go after you in chains they will come over and they will go down on their faces before you and will make prayer to you saying truly god is among you and there is no other god
 truly you have a secret god the god of israel is a saviour 
 all those who have gone against him will be put to shame the makers of images will be made low
 but the lord will make israel free with an eternal salvation you will not be put to shame or made low for ever and ever
