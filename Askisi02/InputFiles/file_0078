 for this reason we from the day when we had word of it keep on in prayer for you that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose with all wisdom and experience of the spirit
 living uprightly in the approval of the lord giving fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
 full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory so that you may undergo all troubles with joy
 giving praise to the father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light
 who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the son of his love
 in whom we have our salvation the forgiveness of sins
 who is the image of the unseen god coming into existence before all living things
 for by him all things were made in heaven and on earth things seen and things unseen authorities lords rulers and powers all things were made by him and for him
 he is before all things and in him all things have being
 and he is the head of the body the church the starting point of all things the first to come again from the dead so that in all things he might have the chief place
 for god in full measure was pleased to be in him
 through him uniting all things with himself having made peace through the blood of his cross through him i say uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven
 and you who in the past were cut off and at war with god in your minds through evil works he has now made one
 in the body of his flesh through death so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him
 if you keep yourselves safely based in the faith not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you and which was given to every living being under heaven of which i paul was made a servant
 now i have joy in my pain because of you and in my flesh i undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of christ complete for the salvation of his body the church
 of which i became a servant by the purpose of god which was given to me for you to give effect to the word of god
 the secret which has been kept from all times and generations but has now been made clear to his saints
 to whom god was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
 whom we are preaching guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom so that every man may be complete in christ
 and for this purpose i am working using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly
 for it is my desire to give you news of the great fight i am making for you and for those at laodicea and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh
 so that their hearts may be comforted and that being joined together in love they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of god even christ
 in whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge
 i say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words
 for though i am not present in the flesh still i am with you in the spirit seeing with joy your order and your unchanging faith in christ
 as then you took christ jesus the lord so go on in him
 rooted and based together in him strong in the faith which the teaching gave you giving praise to god at all times
 take care that no one takes you away by force through mans wisdom and deceit going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world and not after christ
 for in him all the wealth of gods being has a living form
