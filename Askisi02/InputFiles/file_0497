 and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the girl went and got the childs mother
 and pharaohs daughter said to her take the child away and give it milk for me and i will give you payment and the woman took the child and gave it milk at her breast
 and when the child was older she took him to pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she gave him the name moses because she said i took him out of the water
 now when moses had become a man one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was and he saw an egyptian giving blows to a hebrew one of his people
 and turning this way and that and seeing no one he put the egyptian to death covering his body with sand
 and he went out the day after and saw two of the hebrews fighting and he said to him who was in the wrong why are you fighting your brother
 and he said who made you a ruler and a judge over us are you going to put me to death as you did the egyptian and moses was in fear and said it is clear that the thing has come to light
 now when pharaoh had news of this he would have put moses to death but moses went in flight from pharaoh into the land of midian and he took his seat by a water spring
 now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came to get water for their fathers flock
 and the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away but moses got up and came to their help watering their flock for them
 and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that you have come back so quickly today
 and they said an egyptian came to our help against the keepers of sheep and got water for us and gave it to the flock
 and he said to his daughters where is he why have you let the man go make him come in and give him a meal
 and moses was happy to go on living with the man and he gave his daughter zipporah to moses
 and she gave birth to a son to whom he gave the name gershom for he said i have been living in a strange land
 now after a long time the king of egypt came to his end and the children of israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work and their cry for help came to the ears of god
 and at the sound of their weeping the agreement which god had made with abraham and isaac and jacob came to his mind
 and gods eyes were turned to the children of israel and he gave them the knowledge of himself
 and god said all these words
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 you are to have no other gods but me
 you are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth
 you may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for i the lord your god am a god who will not give his honour to another and i will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
 and i will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
 you are not to make use of the name of the lord your god for an evil purpose whoever takes the lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the lord
 keep in memory the sabbath and let it be a holy day
 on six days do all your work
 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on that day you are to do no work you or your son or your daughter your man servant or your woman servant your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you
 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and the sea and everything in them and he took his rest on the seventh day for this reason the lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy
 give honour to your father and to your mother so that your life may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you
