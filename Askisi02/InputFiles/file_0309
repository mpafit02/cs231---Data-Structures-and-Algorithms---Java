 and on jehu son of nimshi making him king over israel and on elisha the son of shaphat of abel meholah to be prophet in your place
 and it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of hazael jehu will put to death and whoever gets away safe from the sword of jehu elisha will put to death
 but i will keep safe seven thousand in israel all those whose knees have not been bent to baal and whose mouths have given him no kisses
 so he went away from there and came across elisha the son of shaphat ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen he himself walking with the twelfth and elijah went up to him and put his robe on him
 and letting the oxen be where they were he came running after elijah and said only let me give a kiss to my father and mother and then i will come after you but he said to him go back again for what have i done to you
 and he went back and took the oxen and put them to death and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen he gave the people a feast then he got up and went after elijah and became his servant
 now the time of davids death came near and he gave orders to solomon his son saying
 i am going the way of all the earth so be strong and be a man
 and keep the orders of the lord your god walking in his ways keeping his laws and his orders and his rules and his words as they are recorded in the law of moses so that you may do well in all you do and wherever you go
 so that the lord may give effect to what he said of me if your children give attention to their ways living uprightly before me with all their heart and their soul you will never be without a man to be king in israel
 now you have knowledge of what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and to the two captains of the army of israel abner the son of ner and amasa the son of jether whom he put to death taking payment for the blood of war in time of peace and making the band of my clothing and the shoes on my feet red with the blood of one put to death without cause
 so be guided by your wisdom and let not his white head go down to the underworld in peace
 but be good to the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be guests at your table for so they came to me when i went in flight from absalom your brother
 now you have with you shimei the son of gera the benjamite of bahurim who put a bitter curse on me on the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to see me at jordan and i gave him my oath by the lord saying i will not put you to death by the sword
 but do not let him be free from punishment for you are a wise man and it will be clear to you what you have to do with him see that his white head goes down to the underworld in blood
 then david went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david
 david was king over israel for forty years for seven years he was king in hebron and for thirty three years in jerusalem
 and solomon took his place on the seat of david his father and his kingdom was made safe and strong
 then adonijah the son of haggith came to bath sheba the mother of solomon and she said come you in peace and he said yes in peace
 then he said i have something to say to you and she said say on
 and he said you saw how the kingdom was mine and all israel had the idea that i would be their king but now the kingdom is turned about and has become my brothers for it was given to him by the lord
 now i have one request to make to you and do not say no to me and she said to him say on
 then he said will you go to solomon the king  for he will not say no to you  and put before him my request that he will give me abishag the shunammite for a wife
 and bath sheba said good  i will make your request to the king
 so bath sheba went to king solomon to have talk with him on adonijahs account and the king got up to come to her and went down low to the earth before her then he took his place on the kings seat and had a seat made ready for the kings mother and she took her place at his right hand
 then she said i have one small request to make to you do not say no to me and the king said say on my mother for i will not say no to you
 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah your brother for a wife
 then king solomon made answer and said to his mother why are you requesting me to give abishag the shunammite to adonijah take the kingdom for him in addition for he is my older brother and abiathar the priest and joab the son of zeruiah are on his side
 then king solomon took an oath by the lord saying may gods punishment be on me if adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life
 now by the living lord who has given me my place on the seat of david my father and made me one of a line of kings as he gave me his word truly adonijah will be put to death this day
