 but i say to you that even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
 but if god gives such clothing to the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven will he not much more give you clothing o you of little faith
 then do not be full of care saying what are we to have for food or drink or with what may we be clothed
 because the gentiles go in search of all these things for your father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things
 but let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be given to you in addition
 then have no care for tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself take the trouble of the day as it comes
 be not judges of others and you will not be judged
 for as you have been judging so you will be judged and with your measure will it be measured to you
 and why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
 or how will you say to your brother let me take out the grain of dust from your eye when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye
 you false one first take out the bit of wood from your eye then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brothers eye
 do not give that which is holy to the dogs or put your jewels before pigs for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you
 make a request and it will be answered what you are searching for you will get give the sign and the door will be open to you
 because to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
 or which of you if his son makes a request for bread will give him a stone
 or if he makes a request for a fish will give him a snake
 if you then being evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him
 all those things then which you would have men do to you even so do you to them because this is the law and the prophets
 go in by the narrow door for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction and great numbers go in by it
 for narrow is the door and hard the road to life and only a small number make discovery of it
 be on the watch for false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inside they are cruel wolves
 by their fruits you will get knowledge of them do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles
 even so every good tree gives good fruit but the bad tree gives evil fruit
 it is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit and a bad tree will not give good fruit
 every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire
 so by their fruits you will get knowledge of them
 not everyone who says to me lord lord will go into the kingdom of heaven but he who does the pleasure of my father in heaven
 a great number will say to me on that day lord lord were we not prophets in your name and did we not by your name send out evil spirits and by your name do works of power
 and then will i say to them i never had knowledge of you go from me you workers of evil
 everyone then to whom my words come and who does them will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock
