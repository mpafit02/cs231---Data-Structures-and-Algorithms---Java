 the sailors go up to heaven and down into the deep their souls are wasted because of their trouble
 they are turned here and there rolling like a man who is full of wine and all their wisdom comes to nothing
 then they send up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
 he makes the storm into a calm so that the waves are at peace
 then they are glad because the sea is quiet and he takes them to the harbour of their desire
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people and praise among the chiefs
 he makes rivers into waste places and springs of water into a dry land
 he makes a fertile country into a salt waste because of the sins of those who are living there
 he makes a waste land into a place of water and a dry land into water springs
 and there he gives the poor a resting place so that they may make themselves a town
 and put seed in the fields and make vine gardens to give them fruit
 he gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly and their cattle do not become less
 and when they are made low and crushed by trouble and sorrow
 he puts an end to the pride of kings and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way
 but he puts the poor man on high from his troubles and gives him families like a flock
 the upright see it and are glad the mouth of the sinner is stopped
 let the wise give thought to these things and see the mercies of the lord
 &lta song a psalm of david&gt o god my heart is fixed i will make songs and melody even with my glory
 give out your sounds o corded instruments the dawn will be awaking with my song
 i will give you praise o lord among the peoples i will make melody to you among the nations
 for your mercy is higher than the heavens and your unchanging faith than the clouds
 be lifted up o god higher than the heavens let your glory be over all the earth
 let your right hand be stretched out for salvation and give me an answer so that your loved ones may be safe from danger
 this is the word of the holy god i will be glad i will make shechem a heritage measuring out the valley of succoth
 gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim is the strength of my head judah is my law giver
 moab is my washpot on edom is the resting place of my shoe over philistia will i send out a glad cry
 who will take me into the strong town who will be my guide into edom
 have you not sent us away from you o god and you go not out with our armies
 give us help in our trouble for there is no help in man
