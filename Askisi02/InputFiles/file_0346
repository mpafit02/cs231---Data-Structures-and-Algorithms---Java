 and when david came to ziklag he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of judah and to his friends saying here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the lord
 he sent to those who were in beth el and in ramah of the south and in jattir
 and to those in arara and eshtemoa
 and carmel and in the towns of the jerahmeelites and in the towns of the kenites
 and to those who were in hormah and in bor ashan and in athach
 and in hebron and to all the places where david and his men had been living
 now the philistines were fighting against israel and the men of israel went in flight before the philistines falling down wounded in mount gilboa
 and the philistines overtook saul and his sons and they put to death jonathan and abinadab and malchi shua the sons of saul
 and the fight was going badly for saul and the archers came across him and he was wounded by the archers
 then saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms take out your sword and put it through me before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me but his servant full of fear would not do so then saul took out his sword and falling on it put an end to himself
 and when his servant saw that saul was dead he did the same and was united with him in death
 so death overtook saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day
 and when the men of israel across the valley and on the other side of jordan saw that the army of israel was in flight and that saul and his sons were dead they came out of their towns and went in flight and the philistines came and took them for themselves
 now on the day after when the philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw saul and his three sons dead on the earth in mount gilboa
 and cutting off his head and taking away his war dress they sent word into the land of the philistines round about to take the news to their gods and to the people
 his war dress they put in the house of astarte and his body was fixed on the wall of beth shan
 and when the people of jabesh gilead had news of what the philistines had done to saul
 all the fighting men got up and travelling all night took sauls body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of beth shan and they came to jabesh and had them burned there
 and their bones they put in the earth under a tree in jabesh and for seven days they took no food
 now at that time the philistines came together to make war against israel and the men of israel went out to war against the philistines and took up their position at the side of eben ezer and the philistines put their forces in position in aphek
 and the philistines put their forces in order against israel and the fighting was hard and israel was overcome by the philistines who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field
 and when the people came back to their tents the responsible men of israel said why has the lord let the philistines overcome us today let us get the ark of the lords agreement here from shiloh so that it may be with us and give us salvation from the hands of those who are against us
 so the people sent to shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the lord of armies whose resting place is between the winged ones and hophni and phinehas the two sons of eli were there with the ark of gods agreement
 and when the ark of the lords agreement came into the tent circle all israel gave a great cry so that the earth was sounding with it
 and the philistines hearing the noise of their cry said what is this great cry among the tents of the hebrews then it became clear to them that the ark of the lord had come to the tent circle
 and the philistines full of fear said god has come into their tents and they said trouble is ours  for never before has such a thing been seen
 trouble is ours  who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods these are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the egyptians in the waste land
 be strong o philistines be men  do not be servants to the hebrews as they have been to you go forward to the fight without fear
 so the philistines went to the fight and israel was overcome and every man went in flight to his tent and great was the destruction for thirty thousand footmen of israel were put to the sword
 and the ark of god was taken and hophni and phinehas the sons of eli were put to the sword
