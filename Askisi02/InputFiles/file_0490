 and the egyptians were forcing the people on to get them out of the land quickly for they said we are all dead men
 and the people took their bread paste before it was leavened putting their basins in their clothing on their backs
 and the children of israel had done as moses had said and they got from the egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold and clothing
 and the lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested so they took away all their goods from the egyptians
 and the children of israel made the journey from rameses to succoth there were about six hundred thousand men on foot as well as children
 and a mixed band of people went with them and flocks and herds in great numbers
 and they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of egypt it was not leavened for they had been sent out of egypt so quickly that they had no time to make any food ready
 now the children of israel had been living in egypt for four hundred and thirty years
 and at the end of four hundred and thirty years to the very day all the armies of the lord went out of the land of egypt
 it is a watch night before the lord who took them out of the land of egypt this same night is a watch night to the lord for all the children of israel through all their generations
 and the lord said to moses and aaron this is the law of the passover no man who is not an israelite is to take of it
 but every mans servant whom he has got for money may take of it when he has had circumcision
 a man from a strange country living among you and a servant working for payment may not take part in it
 it is to be taken in one house not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house and no bone of it may be broken
 all israel is to keep the feast
 and if a man from another country is living with you and has a desire to keep the passover to the lord let all the males of his family undergo circumcision and then let him come near and keep it for he will then be as one of your people but no one without circumcision may keep it
 the law is the same for him who is an israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you
 so the children of israel did as the lord gave orders to moses and aaron
 and on that very day the lord took the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
 and the lord said to moses
 let the first male child of every mother among the children of israel be kept holy for me even the first male birth among man or beast for it is mine
 and moses said to the people let this day on which you came out of egypt out of your prison house be kept for ever in memory for by the strength of his hand the lord has taken you out from this place let no leavened bread be used
 on this day in the month abib you are going out
 and it will be that when the lord takes you into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite the land which he made an oath to your fathers that he would give you a land flowing with milk and honey you will do this act of worship in this month
 for seven days let your food be unleavened cakes and on the seventh day there is to be a feast to the lord
 unleavened cakes are to be your food through all the seven days let no leavened bread be seen among you or any leaven in any part of your land
 and you will say to your son in that day it is because of what the lord did for me when i came out of egypt
 and this will be for a sign to you on your hand and for a mark on your brow so that the law of the lord may be in your mouth for with a strong hand the lord took you out of egypt
 so let this order be kept at the right time from year to year
 and when the lord takes you into the land of canaan as he made his oath to you and to your fathers and gives it to you
