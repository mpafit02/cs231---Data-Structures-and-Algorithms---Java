 and when he was purposing to put shame on israel jonathan the son of shimei davids brother put him to death
 these four were of the offspring of the rephaim in gath and they came to their end by the hands of david and his servants
 and david made a song to the lord in these words on the day when the lord made him free from the hands of all his haters and from the hand of saul
 and he said the lord is my rock my walled town and my saviour even mine
 my god my rock in him will i put my faith my breastplate and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my safe place my saviour who keeps me safe from the violent man
 i will send up my cry to the lord who is to be praised so will i be made safe from those who are against me
 for the waves of death came round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
 the cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
 in my trouble my voice went up to the lord and my cry to my god my voice came to his hearing in his holy temple and my prayer came to his ears
 then the earth was moved with a violent shock the bases of heaven were moved and shaking because he was angry
 there went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth coals were lighted by it
 the heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
 and he went through the air seated on a storm cloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
 and he made the dark his tent round him a mass of waters thick clouds of the skies
 before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and coals of fire
 the lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the highest was sounding out
 and he sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
 then the deep beds of the sea were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of the lords wrath because of the breath of his mouth
 he sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
 he made me free from my strong hater from those who were against me because they were stronger than i
 they came on me in the day of my trouble but the lord was my support
 he took me out into a wide place he was my saviour because he had delight in me
 the lord gives me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean before him
 for i have kept the ways of the lord i have not been turned away in sin from my god
 for all his decisions were before me and i did not put away his laws from me
 and i was upright before him and i kept myself from sin
 because of this the lord has given me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean in his eyes
 on him who has mercy you will have mercy to the upright you will be upright
 he who is holy will see that you are holy but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge
 for you are the saviour of those who are in trouble but your eyes are on men of pride to make them low
