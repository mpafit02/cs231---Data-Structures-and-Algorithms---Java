 if i send them away to their houses with no food they will be overcome by weariness on the way and some of them have come from far
 and his disciples said in answer how will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place
 and he put the question how much bread have you and they said seven cakes
 and he made the people be seated on the earth and he took the seven cakes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to his disciples to put before them and they put it before the people
 and they had some small fishes and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way
 and they took the food and had enough and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits
 and there were about four thousand people and he sent them away
 and he got into the boat with his disciples straight away and came into the country of dalmanutha
 and the pharisees came out and put questions to him requesting from him a sign from heaven testing him
 and he was very sad in spirit and said why is this generation looking for a sign truly i say to you no sign will be given to this generation
 and he went away from them and again got into the boat and went across to the other side
 and they had taken no thought to get bread and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat
 and he said to them take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod
 and they said to one another we have no bread
 and jesus hearing it said to them why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread do you still not see and is it still not clear to you are your hearts so hard
 having eyes do you not see and having ears have you no hearing and have you no memory
 when i made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up they said to him twelve
 and when the seven among the four thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up and they said to him seven
 and he said to them is it still not clear to you
 and they came to beth saida and they took a blind man to him requesting him to put his hands on him
 and he took the blind man by the hand and went with him out of the town and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes and put his hands on him he said do you see anything
 and looking up he said i see men i see them like trees walking
 then again he put his hands on his eyes and looking hard he was able to see and saw all things clearly
 and he sent him away to his house saying do not even go into the town
 and jesus went out with his disciples into the little towns round caesarea philippi and on the way he put a question to his disciples saying who do men say that i am
 and they made answer john the baptist and others elijah but others one of the prophets
 and he said to them but who do you say i am peter said in answer you are the christ
 and he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone
 and teaching them he said that the son of man would have to undergo much and be hated by those in authority and the chief priests and the scribes and be put to death and after three days come back from the dead
 and he said this openly and peter took him and was protesting
