 those who make them are like them and so is everyone who puts his faith in them
 o israel have faith in the lord he is their help and their breastplate
 o house of aaron have faith in the lord he is their help and their breastplate
 you worshippers of the lord have faith in the lord he is their help and their breastplate
 the lord has kept us in mind and will give us his blessing he will send blessings on the house of israel and on the house of aaron
 he will send blessings on the worshippers of the lord on the small and on the great
 may the lord give you and your children still greater increase
 may you have the blessing of the lord who made heaven and earth
 the heavens are the lords but the earth he has given to the children of men
 the dead do not give praise to the lord or those who go down to the underworld
 but we will give praise to the lord now and for ever praise be to the lord
 i have given my love to the lord because he has given ear to the voice of my cry and my prayer
 he has let my request come before him and i will make my prayer to him all my days
 the nets of death were round me and the pains of the underworld had me in their grip i was full of trouble and sorrow
 then i made my prayer to the lord saying o lord take my soul out of trouble
 the lord is full of grace and righteousness truly he is a god of mercy
 the lord keeps the simple i was made low and he was my saviour
 come back to your rest o my soul for the lord has given you your reward
 you have taken my soul from the power of death keeping my eyes from weeping and my feet from falling
 i will go before the lord in the land of the living
 i still had faith though i said i am in great trouble
 though i said in my fear all men are false
 what may i give to the lord for all the good things which he has done for me
 i will take the cup of salvation and give praise to the name of the lord
 i will make the offering of my oath to the lord even before all his people
 dear in the eyes of the lord is the death of his saints
 o lord truly i am your servant i am your servant the son of her who is your servant by you have my cords been broken
 i will give an offering of praise to you and make my prayer in the name of the lord
 i will make the offerings of my oath even before all his people
 in the lords house even in jerusalem praise be to the lord
