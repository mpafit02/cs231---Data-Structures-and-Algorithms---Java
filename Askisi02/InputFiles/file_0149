 and jesus said to him why do you say that i am good no one is good but only god
 you have knowledge of what the law says do not be untrue to your wife do not put anyone to death do not take what is not yours do not give false witness give honour to your father and mother
 and he said all these things i have done from the time when i was a boy
 and jesus hearing it said to him one thing you still have need of get money for your goods and give it away to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
 but at these words he became very sad for he had great wealth
 and jesus looking at him said how hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of god 
 it is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of god
 and those who were present said then who may have salvation
 but he said things which are not possible with man are possible with god
 and peter said see we have given up what is ours to come after you
 and he said to them truly i say to you there is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children because of the kingdom of god
 who will not get much more in this time and in the world to come eternal life
 and he took with him the twelve and said to them now we are going up to jerusalem and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the son of man
 for he will be given up to the gentiles and will be made sport of and put to shame
 and he will be given cruel blows and put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
 but they did not take in the sense of any of these words and what he said was not clear to them and their minds were not able to see it
 and it came about that when he got near jericho a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road making requests for money from those who went by
 and hearing the sound of a great number of people going by he said what is this
 and they said to him jesus of nazareth is going by
 and he said in a loud voice jesus son of david have mercy on me
 and those who were in front made protests and said to him be quiet but he said all the more o son of david have mercy on me
 and jesus stopping gave orders that he was to come to him and when he came near he said to him
 what would you have me do for you and he said lord that i may be able to see again
 and jesus said see again your faith has made you well
 and straight away he was able to see and he went after him giving glory to god and all the people when they saw it gave praise to god
 and he went into jericho and when he was going through it
 a man named zacchaeus who was the chief tax farmer and a man of wealth
 made an attempt to get a view of jesus and was not able to do so because of the people for he was a small man
 and he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him for he was going that way
 and when jesus came to the place looking up he said to him zacchaeus be quick and come down for i am coming to your house today
