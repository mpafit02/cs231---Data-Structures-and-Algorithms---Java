 and their fate will be used as a curse by all the prisoners of judah who are in babylon who will say may the lord make you like zedekiah and like ahab who were burned in the fire by the king of babylon
 because they have done shame in israel and have taken their neighbours wives and in my name have said false words which i did not give them orders to say and i myself am the witness says the lord
 about shemaiah the nehelamite
 shemaiah the nehelamite sent a letter in his name to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
 the lord has made you priest in place of jehoiada the priest to be an overseer in the house of the lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet to put such men in prison and in chains
 so why have you made no protest against jeremiah of anathoth who is acting as a prophet to you
 for he has sent to us in babylon saying the time will be long go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
 and zephaniah the priest made clear to jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter reading it to him
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet saying
 send to all those who have been taken away saying this is what the lord has said about shemaiah the nehelamite because shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you and i did not send him and has made you put your faith in what is false
 for this cause the lord has said truly i will send punishment on shemaiah and on his seed not a man of his family will have a place among this people and he will not see the good which i am going to do to my people says the lord because he has said words against the lord
 they say if a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another mans will he go back to her again will not that land have been made unclean but though you have been acting like a loose woman with a number of lovers will you now come back to me says the lord
 let your eyes be lifted up to the open hilltops and see where have you not been taken by your lovers you have been seated waiting for them by the wayside like an arabian in the waste land you have made the land unclean with your loose ways and your evil doing
 so the showers have been kept back and there has been no spring rain still your brow is the brow of a loose woman you will not let yourself be shamed
 will you not from this time make your prayer to me crying my father you are the friend of my early years
 will he be angry for ever will he keep his wrath to the end these things you have said and have done evil and have had your way
 and the lord said to me in the days of josiah the king have you seen what israel turning away from me has done she has gone up on every high mountain and under every branching tree acting like a loose woman there
 and i said after she has done all these things she will come back to me but she did not and her false sister judah saw it
 and though she saw that because israel turning away from me had been untrue to me i had put her away and given her a statement in writing ending the relation between us still judah her false sister had no fear but went and did the same
 so that through all her loose behaviour the land became unclean and she was untrue giving herself to stones and trees
 but for all this her false sister judah has not come back to me with all her heart but with deceit says the lord
 and the lord said to me israel in her turning away is seen to be more upright than false judah
 go and give out these words to the north and say come back o israel though you have been turned away from me says the lord my face will not be against you in wrath for i am full of mercy says the lord i will not be angry for ever
 only be conscious of your sin the evil you have done against the lord your god you have gone with strange men under every branching tree giving no attention to my voice says the lord
 come back o children who are turned away says the lord for i am a husband to you and i will take you one from a town and two from a family and will make you come to zion
 and i will give you keepers pleasing to my heart who will give you your food with knowledge and wisdom
 and it will come about when your numbers are increased in the land in those days says the lord that they will no longer say the ark of the agreement of the lord it will not come into their minds they will not have any memory of it or be conscious of the loss of it and it will not be made again
 at that time jerusalem will be named the seat of the lords kingdom and all the nations will come together to it to the name of the lord to jerusalem and no longer will their steps be guided by the purposes of their evil hearts
 in those days the family of judah will go with the family of israel and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which i gave for a heritage to your fathers
 but i said how am i to put you among the children and give you a desired land a heritage of glory among the armies of the nations and i said you are to say to me my father and not be turned away from me
