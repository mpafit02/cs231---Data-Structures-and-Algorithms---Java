 and do not keep the rules of the nations which i am driving out before you for they did all these things and for that reason my soul was turned against them
 but i have said to you you will take their land and i will give it to you for your heritage a land flowing with milk and honey i am the lord your god who have made you separate from all other peoples
 so then make division between the clean beast and the unclean and between the clean bird and the unclean do not make yourselves disgusting by any beast or bird or anything which goes flat on the earth which has been marked by me as unclean for you
 and you are to be holy to me for i the lord am holy and have made you separate from the nations so that you may be my people
 any man or woman who makes use of spirits or who is a wonder worker is to be put to death they are to be stoned with stones their blood will be on them
 and the lord said to moses say to the priests the sons of aaron let no man make himself unclean for the dead among his people
 but only for his near relations for his mother or his father his son or his daughter and his brother
 and for his sister a virgin for she is his near relation and has had no husband he may make himself unclean
 but let him being a chief among his people not make himself unclean in such a way as to put shame on himself
 they are not to have their hair cut off for the dead or the hair on their chins cut short or make cuts in their flesh
 let them be holy to their god and not make the name of their god common for the fire offerings of the lord and the bread of their god are offered by them and they are to be holy
 they may not take as wife a loose or common woman or one who has been put away by her husband for the priest is holy to his god
 and he is to be holy in your eyes for by him the bread of your god is offered he is to be holy in your eyes for i the lord who make you holy am holy
 and if the daughter of a priest makes herself common and by her loose behaviour puts shame on her father let her be burned with fire
 and he who is the chief priest among his brothers on whose head the holy oil has been put who is marked out to put on the holy robes may not let his hair go loose or have his clothing out of order as a sign of sorrow
 he may not go near any dead body or make himself unclean for his father or his mother
 he may not go out of the holy place or make the holy place of his god common for the crown of the holy oil of his god is on him i am the lord
 and let him take as his wife one who has not had relations with a man
 a widow or one whose husband has put her away or a common woman of loose behaviour may not be the wife of a priest but let him take a virgin from among his people
 and he may not make his seed unclean among his people for i the lord have made him holy
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron if a man of your family in any generation is damaged in body let him not come near to make the offering of the bread of his god
 for any man whose body is damaged may not come near one who is blind or has not the use of his legs or one who has a broken nose or any unnatural growth
 or a man with broken feet or hands
 or one whose back is bent or one who is unnaturally small or one who has a damaged eye or whose skin is diseased or whose sex parts are damaged
 no man of the offspring of aaron whose body is damaged in any way may come near to give the fire offerings of the lord he is damaged he may not come near to make the offerings
 he may take of the bread of god the holy and the most holy
 but he may not go inside the veil or come near the altar because he is damaged and he may not make my holy places common for i the lord have made them holy
 these are the words which moses said to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel
 and the lord said to moses
