 the lord has given my master every blessing and he has become great he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men servants and women servants and camels and asses
 and when sarah my masters wife was old she gave birth to a son to whom he has given all he has
 and my master made me take an oath saying do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i am living
 but go to my fathers house and to my relations for a wife for my son
 and i said to my master what if the woman will not come with me
 and he said the lord whom i have ever kept before me will send his angel with you who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my fathers house
 and you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people and if they will not give her to you you will be free from your oath
 and i came today to the water spring and i said o lord the god of my master abraham if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey
 let it come about that while i am waiting here by the water spring if a girl comes to get water and i say to her give me a little water from your vessel and she says
 take a drink and i will get water for your camels let her be the woman marked out by the lord for my masters son
 and even while i was saying this to myself rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm and she went down to the spring to get water and i said to her give me a drink
 and straight away she took down her vessel from her arm and said take a drink and i will get water for your camels
 and questioning her i said whose daughter are you and she said the daughter of bethuel the son of nahor and milcah his wife then i put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands
 and with bent head i gave worship and praise to the lord the god of my master abraham by whom i had been guided in the right way to get the daughter of my masters brother for his son
 and now say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not in order that it may be clear to me what i have to do
 then laban and bethuel said in answer this is the lords doing it is not for us to say yes or no to you
 see here is rebekah take her and go and let her be your masters sons wife as the lord has said
 and at these words abrahams servant went down on his face and gave praise to the lord
 then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to rebekah and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother
 then he and the men who were with him had food and drink and took their rest there that night and in the morning he got up and said let me now go back to my master
 but her brother and her mother said let the girl be with us a week or ten days and then she may go
 and he said do not keep me the lord has given a good outcome to my journey let me now go back to my master
 and they said we will send for the girl and let her make the decision
 and they sent for rebekah and said to her are you ready to go with this man and she said i am ready
 so they sent their sister rebekah and her servant with abrahams servant and his men
 and they gave rebekah their blessing saying o sister may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them
 so rebekah and her servant women went with the man seated on the camels and so the servant took rebekah and went on his way
 now isaac had come through the waste land to beer lahai roi for he was living in the south
 and when the evening was near he went wandering out into the fields and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming
 and when rebekah looking up saw isaac she got down from her camel
