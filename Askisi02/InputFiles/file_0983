 your righteousness is like the mountains of god your judging is like the great deep o lord you give life to man and beast
 how good is your loving mercy o god  the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings
 the delights of your house will be showered on them you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures
 for with you is the fountain of life in your light we will see light
 o let there be no end to your loving mercy to those who have knowledge of you or of your righteousness to the upright in heart
 let not the foot of pride come against me or the hand of the evil doers put me out of my place
 there the workers of evil have come down they have been made low and will not be lifted up
 &ltof david&gt do not be angry because of the wrongdoers or have envy of the workers of evil
 for they will quickly be cut down like grass and become dry like the green plants
 have faith in the lord and do good be at rest in the land and go after righteousness
 so will your delight be in the lord and he will give you your hearts desires
 put your life in the hands of the lord have faith in him and he will do it
 and he will make your righteousness be seen like the light and your cause like the shining of the sun
 take your rest in the lord waiting quietly for him do not be angry because of the man who does well in his evil ways and gives effect to his bad designs
 put an end to your wrath and be no longer bitter do not give way to angry feeling which is a cause of sin
 for the evil doers will be cut off but those who have faith in the lord will have the earth for their heritage
 for in a short time the evil doer will be gone you will go searching for his place and it will not be there
 but the gentle will have the earth for their heritage they will take their delight in peace without measure
 the sinner has evil designs against the upright lifting up the voice of wrath against him
 he will be laughed at by the lord who sees that his day is coming
 the evil doers have taken out their swords their bows are bent for crushing the poor and to put to death those who are upright in their ways
 but their swords will be turned into their hearts and their bows will be broken
 the little which the good man has is better than the wealth of evil doers
 for the arms of the evil doers will be broken but the lord is the support of the good
 the days of the upright are numbered by the lord and their heritage will be for ever
 they will not be shamed in the evil time and in the days when all are in need of food they will have enough
 but the wrongdoers will come to destruction and the haters of the lord will be like the fat of lambs they will be burned up they will go up in smoke and never again be seen
 the sinner takes money and does not give it back but the upright man has mercy and gives to others
 those who have his blessing will have the earth for their heritage but those who are cursed by him will be cut off
 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he takes delight in his way
