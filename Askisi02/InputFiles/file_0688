 for this cause the lord has said if you will come back then i will again let you take your place before me and if you give out what is of value and not that which has no value you will be as my mouth let them come back to you but do not go back to them
 and i will make you a strong wall of brass to this people they will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for i am with you to keep you safe says the lord
 i will keep you safe from the hands of the evil doers and i will give you salvation from the hands of the cruel ones
 then again the word of the lord came to me saying
 you are not to take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place
 for this is what the lord has said about the sons and daughters who come to birth in this place and about their mothers who have given them birth and about their fathers who have given life to them in this land
 death from evil diseases will overtake them there will be no weeping for them and their bodies will not be put to rest they will be like waste on the face of the earth the sword and need of food will put an end to them their dead bodies will be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth
 for this is what the lord has said do not go into the house of sorrow do not go to make weeping or songs of grief for them for i have taken away my peace from this people says the lord even mercy and pity
 death will overtake great as well as small in the land their bodies will not be put in a resting place and no one will be weeping for them or wounding themselves or cutting off their hair for them
 no one will make a feast for them in sorrow to give them comfort for the dead or put to their lips the cup of comfort on account of their father or their mother
 and you are not to go into the house of feasting or be seated with them to take food or drink
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said see before your eyes and in your days i will put an end in this place to the laughing voices and the voice of joy to the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride
 and it will be that when you say all these words to the people then they will say to you why has the lord done all this evil against us what is our wrongdoing and what is our sin which we have done against the lord our god
 then you will say to them because your fathers have given me up says the lord and have gone after other gods and become their servants and their worshippers and have given me up and have not kept my law
 and you have done worse evil than your fathers for see every one of you is guided by the pride of his evil heart so as not to give ear to me
 for this reason i will send you away out of this land into a land which is strange to you to you and to your fathers there you will be the servants of other gods day and night and you will have no mercy from me
 for this cause see the days are coming says the lord when it will no longer be said by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of egypt
 but by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of the north and from all the countries where he had sent them and i will take them back again to their land which i gave to their fathers
 see i will send for great numbers of fishermen says the lord and they will take them like fish in a net and after that i will send for numbers of bowmen and they will go after them driving them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks
 for my eyes are on all their ways there is no cover for them from my face and their evil doing is not kept secret from my eyes
 and i will give them the reward of their evil doing and their sin twice over because they have made my land unclean and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things
 o lord my strength and my strong tower my safe place in the day of trouble the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say the heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit even false things in which there is no profit
 will a man make for himself gods which are no gods
 for this reason truly i will make them see this once i will give them knowledge of my hand and my power and they will be certain that my name is the lord
 the sin of judah is recorded with a pen of iron and with the sharp point of a jewel it is cut on their hearts of stone and on the horns of their altars for a sign to them
 their altars and their wood pillars under every branching tree on the high hills and the mountains in the field
 i will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price because of your sins in every part of your land
 and your hand will have to let go your heritage which i gave you and i will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning for ever
 this is what the lord has said cursed is the man who puts his faith in man and makes flesh his arm and whose heart is turned away from the lord
 for he will be like the brushwood in the upland and will not see when good comes but his living place will be in the dry places in the waste land in a salt and unpeopled land
