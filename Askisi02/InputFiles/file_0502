 and he took the book of the agreement reading it in the hearing of the people and they said everything which the lord has said we will do and we will keep his laws
 then moses took the blood and let it come on the people and said this blood is the sign of the agreement which the lord has made with you in these words
 then moses and aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the chiefs of israel went up
 and they saw the god of israel and under his feet there was as it seemed a jewelled floor clear as the heavens
 and he put not his hand on the chiefs of the children of israel they saw god and took food and drink
 and the lord said to moses come up to me on the mountain and take your place there and i will give you the stones on which i have put in writing the law and the orders so that you may give the people knowledge of them
 then moses and joshua his servant got up and moses went up into the mountain of god
 and he said to the chiefs keep your places here till we come back to you aaron and hur are with you if anyone has any cause let him go to them
 and moses went up into the mountain and it was covered by the cloud
 and the glory of the lord was resting on mount sinai and the cloud was over it for six days and on the seventh day he said moses name out of the cloud
 and the glory of the lord was like a flame on the top of the mountain before the eyes of the children of israel
 and moses went up the mountain into the cloud and was there for forty days and forty nights
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that they are to make me an offering from every man who has the impulse in his heart take an offering for me
 and this is the offering you are to take from them gold and silver and brass
 and blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair
 and sheepskins coloured red and leather and hard wood
