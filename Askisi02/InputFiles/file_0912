 an upright man has thought for the life of his beast but the hearts of evil doers are cruel
 he who does work on his land will not be short of bread but he who goes after foolish men is without sense
 the resting place of the sinner will come to destruction but the root of upright men is for ever
 in the sin of the lips is a net which takes the sinner but the upright man will come out of trouble
 from the fruit of his mouth will a man have good food in full measure and the work of a mans hands will be rewarded
 the way of the foolish man seems right to him but the wise man gives ear to suggestions
 a foolish man lets his trouble be openly seen but a sharp man keeps shame secret
 the breathing out of true words gives knowledge of righteousness but a false witness gives out deceit
 there are some whose uncontrolled talk is like the wounds of a sword but the tongue of the wise makes one well again
 true lips are certain for ever but a false tongue is only for a minute
 deceit is in the heart of those whose designs are evil but for those purposing peace there is joy
 no trouble will come to upright men but sinners will be full of evil
 false lips are hated by the lord but those whose acts are true are his delight
 a sharp man keeps back his knowledge but the heart of foolish men makes clear their foolish thoughts
 the hand of the ready worker will have authority but he who is slow in his work will be put to forced work
 care in the heart of a man makes it weighted down but a good word makes it glad
 the upright man is a guide to his neighbour but the way of evil doers is a cause of error to them
 he who is slow in his work does not go in search of food but the ready worker gets much wealth
 in the road of righteousness is life but the way of the evil doer goes to death
 a wise son is a lover of teaching but the ears of the haters of authority are shut to sharp words
 a man will get good from the fruit of his lips but the desire of the false is for violent acts
 he who keeps a watch on his mouth keeps his life but he whose lips are open wide will have destruction
 the hater of work does not get his desires but the soul of the hard workers will be made fat
 the upright man is a hater of false words the evil doer gets a bad name and is put to shame
 righteousness keeps safe him whose way is without error but evil doers are overturned by sin
 a man may be acting as if he had wealth but have nothing another may seem poor but have great wealth
 a man will give his wealth in exchange for his life but the poor will not give ear to sharp words
 there is a glad dawn for the upright man but the light of the sinner will be put out
 the only effect of pride is fighting but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit
 wealth quickly got will become less but he who gets a store by the work of his hands will have it increased
