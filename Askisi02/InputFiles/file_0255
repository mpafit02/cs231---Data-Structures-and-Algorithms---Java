 for the outcome of the law is wrath but where there is no law it will not be broken
 for this reason it is of faith so that it may be through grace and so that the word of god may be certain to all the seed not only to that which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all
  as it is said in the holy writings i have made you a father of a number of nations  before him in whom he had faith that is god who gives life to the dead and to whom the things which are not are as if they were
 who without reason for hope in faith went on hoping so that he became the father of a number of nations as it had been said so will your seed be
 and not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead  he being about a hundred years old  and sarah was no longer able to have children
 still he did not give up faith in the undertaking of god but was made strong by faith giving glory to god
 and being certain that god was able to keep his word
 for which reason it was put to his account as righteousness
 now it was not because of him only that this was said
 but for us in addition to whose account it will be put if we have faith in him who made jesus our lord come back again from the dead
 who was put to death for our evil doing and came to life again so that we might have righteousness
 for which reason because we have righteousness through faith let us be at peace with god through our lord jesus christ
 through whom in the same way we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are and let us have joy in hope of the glory of god
 and not only so but let us have joy in our troubles in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting
 and waiting gives experience and experience hope
 and hope does not put to shame because our hearts are full of the love of god through the holy spirit which is given to us
 for when we were still without strength at the right time christ gave his life for evil doers
 now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life
 but god has made clear his love to us in that when we were still sinners christ gave his life for us
 much more if we now have righteousness by his blood will salvation from the wrath of god come to us through him
 for if when we were haters of god the death of his son made us at peace with him much more now that we are his friends will we have salvation through his life
 and not only so but we have joy in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we are now at peace with god
 for this reason as through one man sin came into the world and death because of sin and so death came to all men because all have done evil
 because till the law came sin was in existence but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken
 but still death had power from adam till moses even over those who had not done wrong like adam who is a picture of him who was to come
 but the free giving of god is not like the wrongdoing of man for if by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men much more did the grace of god and the free giving by the grace of one man jesus christ come to men
 and the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one for the effect of one mans sin was punishment by the decision of god but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number
 for if by the wrongdoing of one death was ruling through the one much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness be ruling in life through the one even jesus christ
 so then as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men
 because as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of god by one man
