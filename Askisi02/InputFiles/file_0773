 then the children of judah went to joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite said to him you have knowledge of what the lord said to moses the man of god about me and about you in kadesh barnea
 i was forty years old when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to make a search through the land and the account which i gave him was in keeping with his desire
 my brothers however who went up with me made the heart of the people like water but i was true to the lord with all my heart
 and on that day moses took an oath saying truly the land where your feet have been placed will become a heritage for you and your children for ever because you have been true to the lord your god with all your heart
 and now as you see the lord has kept me safe these forty five years from the time when the lord said this to moses while israel was wandering in the waste land and now i am eighty five years old
 and still i am as strong today as i was when moses sent me out as my strength was then so is it now for war and for all the business of life
 so now give me this hill country named by the lord at that time for you had an account of it then how the anakim were there and great walled towns it may be that the lord will be with me and i will be able to take their land as the lord said
 and joshua gave him his blessing and he gave hebron to caleb the son of jephunneh for his heritage
 so hebron became the heritage of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite to this day because with all his heart he was true to the lord the god of israel
 in earlier times the name of hebron had been kiriath arba named after arba the greatest of the anakim and the land had rest from war
 now the part of the land marked out for the children of judah by families went up to the edge of edom as far as the waste land of zin to the south to the farthest point of it on the south
 their south limit was from the farthest part of the salt sea from the inlet looking to the south
 from there it goes south of the slope up to akrabbim and on to zin then south past kadesh barnea and on by hezron and up to addar turning in the direction of karka
 then on to azmon ending at the stream of egypt and the end of the limit is at the sea this will be your limit on the south
 and the east limit is the salt sea as far as the end of jordan and the limit of the north part of the land is from the inlet of the sea at the end of jordan
 then the line goes up to beth hoglah past the north of beth arabah and up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben
 then the line goes up to debir from the valley of achor and so to the north in the direction of gilgal which is opposite the slope up to adummim on the south side of the river and the line goes on to the waters of en shemesh ending at en rogel
 then the line goes up by the valley of the son of hinnom to the south side of the jebusite  which is jerusalem  then up to the top of the mountain in front of the valley of hinnom to the west which is at the farthest point of the valley of rephaim on the north
 and the limit is marked out from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the waters of nephtoah and out to the towns of mount ephron as far as baalah  which is kiriath jearim 
 then turning west the line goes from baalah to mount seir and on to the side of mount jearim  which is chesalon  on the north then down to beth shemesh and on past timnah
 and out to the side of ekron to the north then it is marked out to shikkeron and on to mount baalah ending at jabneel the end of the line is at the sea
 and the limit on the west is the edge of the great sea this is the line going round the land marked out for the children of judah by their families
 and to caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah as the lord had given orders to joshua that is kiriath arba named after arba the father of anak which is hebron
 and the three sons of anak sheshai and ahiman and talmai the children of anak were forced out from there by caleb
 from there he went up against the people of debir  now the name of debir before that was kiriath sepher 
 and caleb said i will give achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes kiriath sepher and takes it
 and othniel the son of kenaz calebs brother took it so he gave him his daughter achsah for his wife
 now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and caleb said to her what is it
 and she said give me a blessing because you have put me in dry south land now give me springs of water so he gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
 this is the heritage of the tribe of judah by their families
