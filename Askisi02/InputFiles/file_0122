 and jesus did such a number of other things that if every one was recorded it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be
 now there was among the pharisees a man named nicodemus who was one of the rulers of the jews
 he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we are certain that you have come from god as a teacher because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if god was not with him
 jesus said to him truly i say to you without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of god
 nicodemus said to him how is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old is he able to go into his mothers body a second time and come to birth again
 jesus said in answer truly i say to you if a mans birth is not from water and from the spirit it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of god
 that which has birth from the flesh is flesh and that which has birth from the spirit is spirit
 do not be surprised that i say to you it is necessary for you to have a second birth
 the wind goes where its pleasure takes it and the sound of it comes to your ears but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes so it is with everyone whose birth is from the spirit
 and nicodemus said to him how is it possible for these things to be
 and jesus answering said are you the teacher of israel and have no knowledge of these things
 truly i say to you we say that of which we have knowledge we give witness of what we have seen and you do not take our witness to be true
 if you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven
 and no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven the son of man
 as the snake was lifted up by moses in the waste land even so it is necessary for the son of man to be lifted up
 so that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life
 for god had such love for the world that he gave his only son so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life
 god did not send his son into the world to be judge of the world he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him
 the man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now because he has no faith in the name of the only son of god
 and this is the test by which men are judged the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light because their acts are evil
 the light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen
 but he whose life is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of god
 after these things jesus and his disciples went into the land of judaea and there he was with them for some time giving baptism
 now john was then giving baptism at aenon near salim because there was much water there and people came and were given baptism
 for at this time john had not been put into prison
 then a question came up between johns disciples and a jew about washing
 and they went to john and said to him rabbi the man who was with you on the other side of the jordan the man to whom you gave witness is now giving baptism and everyone is going to him
 and this was johns answer a man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven
 you yourselves give witness that i said i am not the christ what i said was i am sent before the christ
 he who has the bride is the husband but the husbands friend whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him is full of joy because of the husbands voice such is my joy and it is complete
