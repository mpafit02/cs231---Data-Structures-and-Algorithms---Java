 from kibroth hattaavah the people went on to hazeroth and there they put up their tents
 now miriam and aaron said evil against moses because of the cushite woman to whom he was married for he had taken a cushite woman as his wife
 and they said have the words of the lord been given to moses only have they not come to us and the lord took note of it
 now the man moses was more gentle than any other man on earth
 and suddenly the lord said to moses and aaron and miriam come out you three to the tent of meeting and the three of them went out
 and the lord came down in a pillar of cloud taking his place at the door of the tent and made aaron and miriam come before him
 and he said now give ear to my words if there is a prophet among you i will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream
 my servant moses is not so he is true to me in all my house
 with him i will have talk mouth to mouth openly and not in dark sayings and with his eyes he will see the form of the lord why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant moses
 and burning with wrath against them the lord went away
 and the cloud was moved from over the tent and straight away miriam became a leper as white as snow and aaron looking at miriam saw that she was a leper
 then aaron said to moses o my lord let not our sin be on our heads for we have done foolishly and are sinners
 let her not be as one dead whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother
 and moses crying to the lord said let my prayer come before you o god and make her well
 and the lord said to moses if her father had put a mark of shame on her would she not be shamed for seven days let her be shut up outside the tent circle for seven days and after that she may come in again
 so miriam was shut up outside the tent circle for seven days and the people did not go forward on their journey till miriam had come in again
 after that the people went on from hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of paran
 and the lord said to moses
 send men to get knowledge about the land of canaan which i am giving to the children of israel from every tribe of their fathers you are to send a man every one a chief among them
 and moses sent them from the waste land of paran as the lord gave orders all of them men who were heads of the children of israel
 and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur
 of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
 of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
 of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
