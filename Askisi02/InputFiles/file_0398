 and he said to him did not my heart go with you when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you is this a time for getting money and clothing and olive gardens and vine gardens and sheep and oxen and men servants and women servants
 because of what you have done the disease of naaman the leper will take you in its grip and your seed after you for ever and he went out from before him a leper as white as snow
 now the sons of the prophets said to elisha there is not room enough for us in the place where we are living under your care
 so let us go to jordan and let everyone get to work cutting boards and we will make a living place for ourselves there and he said to them go then
 and one of them said be pleased to go with your servants and he said i will go
 so he went with them and when they came to jordan they got to work cutting down trees
 but one of them while cutting a board let the head of his axe go into the water and he gave a cry and said this is a bad business my master for it is anothers
 and the man of god said where did it go in and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water cutting a stick he put it into the water and the iron came up to the top of the water
 then he said take it up so he put out his hand and took it
 at that time the king of aram was making war against israel and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said i will be waiting in secret in some named place
 and the man of god sent to the king of israel saying take care to keep away from that place for the aramaeans are waiting there in secret
 so the king of israel sent to the place where the man of god had said there was danger and kept clear of it more than once
 and at this the mind of the king of aram was greatly troubled and he sent for his servants and said to them will you not make clear to me which of us is helping the king of israel
 and one of them said not one of us my lord king but elisha the prophet in israel gives the king of israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom
 then he said go and see where he is so that i may send and get him and news came to him that he was in dothan
 so he sent there horses and carriages and a great army and they came by night circling the town
 now the servant of the man of god having got up early and gone out saw an army with horses and carriages of war all round the town and the servant said to him o my master what are we to do
 and he said in answer have no fear those who are with us are more than those who are with them
 then elisha made a prayer to the lord saying lord let his eyes be open so that he may see and the lord made the young mans eyes open and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of fire round elisha
 now when the aramaeans came down to elisha he made a prayer to the lord saying lord make this people blind and he made them blind at elishas request
 and elisha said to them this is not the way and this is not the town come after me so that i may take you to the man you are searching for and he took them to samaria
 and when they had come into samaria elisha said lord let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see and the lord made their eyes open and they saw that they were in the middle of samaria
 and the king of israel when he saw them said to elisha my father am i to put them to the sword
 but he said in answer you are not to put them to death have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow put bread and water before them so that they may have food and drink and go to their master
 so he made ready a great feast for them and when they had had food and drink he sent them away and they went back to their master and no more bands of aramaeans came into the land of israel
 now after this ben hadad king of aram got together all his army and went up to make an attack on samaria shutting the town in on all sides with his forces
 and they became very short of food in samaria for they kept it shut in till the price of an asss head was eighty shekels of silver and a small measure of doves droppings was five shekels of silver
 and when the king of israel was going by on the wall a woman came crying out to him and said help  my lord king
 and he said if the lord does not give you help where am i to get help for you from the grain floor or the grape crusher
 and the king said to her what is troubling you and she said in answer this woman said to me give your son to be our food today and we will have my son tomorrow
