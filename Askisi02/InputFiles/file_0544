 the lord has said my hand will be stretched out against edom cutting off from it man and beast and i will make it waste from teman even as far as dedan they will be put to the sword
 i will take payment from edom because of my people israel and i will take edom in hand in my wrath and in my passion and they will have experience of my reward says the lord
 this is what the lord has said because the philistines have taken payment with the purpose of causing shame and destruction with unending hate
 the lord has said see my hand will be stretched out against the philistines cutting off the cherethites and sending destruction on the rest of the sea land
 and i will take great payment from them with acts of wrath and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send my punishment on them
 now in the eleventh year on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man because tyre has said against jerusalem aha she who was the doorway of the peoples is broken she is turned over to them she who was full is made waste
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against you o tyre and will send up a number of nations against you as the sea sends up its waves
 and they will give the walls of tyre to destruction and have its towers broken and i will take even her dust away from her and make her an uncovered rock
 she will be a place for the stretching out of nets in the middle of the sea for i have said it says the lord and her goods will be given over to the nations
 and her daughters in the open country will be put to the sword and they will be certain that i am the lord
 for this is what the lord has said see i will send up from the north nebuchadrezzar king of babylon king of kings against tyre with horses and war carriages and with an army and great numbers of people
 he will put to the sword your daughters in the open country he will make strong walls against you and put up an earthwork against you arming himself for war against you
 he will put up his engines of war against your walls and your towers will be broken down by his axes
 because of the number of his horses you will be covered with their dust your walls will be shaking at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the war carriages when he comes through your doorways as into a town which has been broken open
 your streets will be stamped down by the feet of his horses he will put your people to the sword and will send down the pillars of your strength to the earth
 they will take by force all your wealth and go off with the goods with which you do trade they will have your walls broken down and all the houses of your desire given up to destruction they will put your stones and your wood and your dust deep in the water
 i will put an end to the noise of your songs and the sound of your instruments of music will be gone for ever
 i will make you an uncovered rock you will be a place for the stretching out of nets there will be no building you up again for i the lord have said it says the lord
 this is what the lord has said to tyre will not the sea lands be shaking at the sound of your fall when the wounded give cries of pain when men are put to the sword in you
 then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their high seats and put away their robes and take off their clothing of needlework they will put on the clothing of grief they will take their seats on the earth shaking with fear every minute and overcome with wonder at you
 and they will send up a song of grief for you and say to you what destruction has come on you how are you cut off from the sea the noted town which was strong in the sea she and her people causing the fear of them to come on all the dry land 
 now the sea lands will be shaking in the day of your fall and all the ships on the sea will be overcome with fear at your going
 for this is what the lord has said i will make you a waste town like the towns which are unpeopled when i make the deep come upon you covering you with great waters
 then i will make you go down with those who go down into the underworld to the people of the past causing your living place to be in the deepest parts of the earth in places long unpeopled with those who go down into the deep so that there will be no one living in you and you will have no glory in the land of the living
 i will make you a thing of fear and you will come to an end even if you are looked for you will not be seen again for ever says the lord
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 and you son of man make a song of grief for tyre
 and say to tyre o you who are seated at the doorway of the sea trading for the peoples with the great sea lands these are the words of the lord you o tyre have said i am a ship completely beautiful
 your builders have made your outlines in the heart of the seas they have made you completely beautiful
