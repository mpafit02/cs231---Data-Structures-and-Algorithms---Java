 so let us make a little room on the wall and put a bed there for him and a table and a seat and a light so that when he comes to us he will be able to go in there
 now one day when he had gone there he went into the little room and took his rest there
 and he said to gehazi his servant send for this shunammite so in answer to his voice she came before him
 and he said to him now say to her see you have taken all this trouble for us what is to be done for you will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army but she said i am living among my people
 so he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi made answer still there is this she has no son and her husband is old
 then he said send for her and in answer to his voice she took her place at the door
 and elisha said at this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms and she said no my lord o man of god do not say what is false to your servant
 then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named in the year after as elisha had said to her
 now one day when the child was older he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut
 and he said to his father my head my head  and the father said to a servant take him in to his mother
 and he took him in to his mother and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day when his life went from him
 then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of god shutting the door on him and went out
 and she said to her husband send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that i may go quickly to the man of god and come back again
 and he said why are you going to him today it is not a new moon or a sabbath but she said it is well
 then she made the ass ready and said to her servant keep driving on do not make a stop without orders from me
 so she went and came to mount carmel to the man of god and when the man of god saw her coming in his direction he said to gehazi his servant see there is the shunammite
 go quickly to her and on meeting her say to her are you well and your husband and the child are they well and she said in answer all is well
 and when she came to where the man of god was on the hill she put her hands round his feet and gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away but the man of god said let her be for her soul is bitter in her and the lord has kept it secret from me and has not given me word of it
 then she said did i make a request to my lord for a son did i not say do not give me false words
 then he said to gehazi make yourself ready and take my stick in your hand and go if you come across anyone on the way give him no blessing and if anyone gives you a blessing give him no answer and put my stick on the childs face
 but the mother of the child said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not go back without you so he got up and went with her
 and gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the childs face but there was no voice and no one gave attention so he went back and meeting him gave him the news saying the child is not awake
 and when elisha came into the house he saw the child dead stretched on his bed
 so he went in and shutting the door on the two of them made prayer to the lord
 then he got up on the bed stretching himself out on the child and put his mouth on the childs mouth his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands and the childs body became warm
 then he came back and after walking once through the house and back he went up stretching himself out on the child seven times and the childs eyes became open
 and he gave orders to gehazi and said send for the shunammite and she came in answer to his voice and he said take up your son
 and she came in and went down on her face to the earth at his feet then she took her son in her arms and went out
 and elisha went back to gilgal now there was very little food in the land and the sons of the prophets were seated before him and he said to his servant put the great pot on the fire and make soup for the sons of the prophets
 and one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full he came back and put the fruit cut up small into the pot of soup having no idea what it was
