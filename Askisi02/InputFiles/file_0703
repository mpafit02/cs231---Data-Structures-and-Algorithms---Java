 see the days are coming says the lord when i will make a new agreement with the people of israel and with the people of judah
 not like the agreement which i made with their fathers on the day when i took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of egypt which agreement was broken by them and i gave them up says the lord
 but this is the agreement which i will make with the people of israel after those days says the lord i will put my law in their inner parts writing it in their hearts and i will be their god and they will be my people
 and no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying get knowledge of the lord for they will all have knowledge of me from the least of them to the greatest of them says the lord for they will have my forgiveness for their evil doing and their sin will go from my memory for ever
 these are the words of the lord who has given the sun for a light by day ordering the moon and stars for a light by night who puts the sea in motion causing the thunder of its waves the lord of armies is his name
 if the order of these things before me is ever broken says the lord then will the seed of israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever
 this is what the lord has said if the heavens on high may be measured and the bases of the earth searched out then i will give up the seed of israel because of all they have done says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord for the building of the lords town from the tower of hananel to the doorway of the angle
 and the measuring line will go out in front of it as far as the hill gareb going round to goah
 and all the valley of the dead bodies and all the field of death as far as the stream kidron up to the angle of the horses doorway to the east will be holy to the lord it will not again be uprooted or overturned for ever
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar
 now at that time the king of babylons army was round jerusalem shutting it in and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen in the house of the king of judah
 for zedekiah king of judah had had him shut up saying why have you as a prophet been saying the lord has said see i will give this town into the hands of the king of babylon and he will take it
 and zedekiah king of judah will not get away from the hands of the chaldaeans but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of babylon and will have talk with him mouth to mouth and see him eye to eye
 and he will take zedekiah away to babylon where he will be till i have pity on him says the lord though you are fighting with the chaldaeans things will not go well for you
 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came to me saying
 see hanamel the son of shallum your fathers brother will come to you and say give the price and get for yourself my property in anathoth for you have the right of the nearest relation
 so hanamel the son of my fathers brother came to me as the lord had said to the place of the armed watchmen and said to me give the price and get my property which is in anathoth in the land of benjamin for you have the nearest relations right to the heritage so get it for yourself then it was clear to me that this was the word of the lord
 so i got for a price the property in anathoth from hanamel the son of my fathers brother and gave him the money seventeen shekels of silver
 and i put it in writing stamping it with my stamp and i took witnesses and put the money into the scales
 so i took the paper witnessing the business one copy rolled up and stamped and one copy open
 and i gave the paper to baruch the son of neriah the son of mahseiah before the eyes of hanamel the son of my fathers brother and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper and before all the jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen
 and i gave orders to baruch in front of them saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said take these papers the witness of this business the one which is rolled up and stamped and the one which is open and put them in a vessel of earth so that they may be kept for a long time
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said there will again be trading in houses and fields and vine gardens in this land
 now after i had given the paper to baruch the son of neriah i made my prayer to the lord saying
 ah lord god  see you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm and there is nothing you are not able to do
 you have mercy on thousands and send punishment for the evil doing of the fathers on their children after them the great the strong god the lord of armies is his name
 great in wisdom and strong in act whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings
 you have done signs and wonders in the land of egypt and even to this day in israel and among other men and have made a name for yourself as at this day
