 be my guide o lord in the ways of your righteousness because of those who are against me make your way straight before my face
 for no faith may be put in their words their inner part is nothing but evil their throat is like an open place for the dead smooth are the words of their tongues
 send them to destruction o lord let their evil designs be the cause of their fall let them be forced out by all their sins because they have gone against your authority
 but let all those who put their faith in you be glad with cries of joy at all times and let all the lovers of your name be glad in you
 for you lord will send a blessing on the upright man your grace will be round him and you will be his strength
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt the god of gods even the lord has sent out his voice and the earth is full of fear from the coming up of the sun to its going down
 from zion most beautiful of places god has sent out his light
 our god will come and will not keep quiet with fire burning before him and storm winds round him
 his voice will go out to the heavens and to the earth for the judging of his people
 let my saints come together to me those who have made an agreement with me by offerings
 and let the heavens make clear his righteousness for god himself is the judge  selah 
 give ear o my people to my words o israel i will be a witness against you i am god even your god
 i will not take up a cause against you because of your offerings or because of your burned offerings which are ever before me
 i will take no ox out of your house or he goats from your flocks
 for every beast of the woodland is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills
 i see all the birds of the mountains and the beasts of the field are mine
 if i had need of food i would not give you word of it for the earth is mine and all its wealth
 am i to take the flesh of the ox for my food or the blood of goats for my drink
 make an offering of praise to god keep the agreements which you have made with the most high
 let your voice come up to me in the day of trouble i will be your saviour so that you may give glory to me
 but to the sinner god says what are you doing talking of my laws or taking the words of my agreement in your mouth
 seeing that you have no desire for my teaching turning your back on my words
 when you saw a thief you were in agreement with him and you were joined with those who took other mens wives
 you have given your mouth to evil your tongue to words of deceit
 you say evil of your brother you make false statements against your mothers son
 these things have you done and i said nothing it seemed to you that i was such a one as yourself but i will make a protest against you and put them in order before your eyes
 now keep this in mind you who have no memory of god for fear that you may be crushed under my hand with no one to give you help
 whoever makes an offering of praise gives glory to me and to him who is upright in his ways i will make clear the salvation of god
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david when nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to bath sheba&gt have pity on me o god in your mercy out of a full heart take away my sin
 let all my wrongdoing be washed away and make me clean from evil
