 and huram said praise be to the lord the god of israel maker of heaven and earth who has given to david the king a wise son full of wisdom and good sense to be the builder of a house for the lord and a house for himself as king
 and now i am sending you a wise and expert man huram who is as my father
 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan whose father was a man of tyre an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in stone and wood in purple and blue and fair linen and red trained in the cutting of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord your father david
 so now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said
 and we will have wood cut from lebanon as much as you have need of and will send it to you on flat boats by sea to joppa and from there you may take it up to jerusalem
 then solomon took the number of all the men from strange lands who were living in israel as his father david had done there were a hundred and fifty three thousand six hundred
 seventy thousand he put to the work of transport eighty thousand to cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers to put the people to work
 now after this the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them some of the meunim made war against jehoshaphat
 and they came to jehoshaphat with the news saying a great army is moving against you from edom across the sea and now they are in hazazon tamar  which is en gedi 
 then jehoshaphat in his fear went to the lord for directions and gave orders all through judah for the people to go without food
 and judah came together to make prayer for help from the lord from every town of judah they came to give worship to the lord
 and jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord in front of the new open space
 and said o lord the god of our fathers are you not god in heaven are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against you
 did you not o lord our god after driving out the people of this land before your people israel give it to the seed of abraham your friend for ever
 and they made it their living place building there a holy house for your name and saying
 if evil comes on us the sword or punishment or disease or need of food we will come to this house and to you  for your name is in this house  crying to you in our trouble and you will give us salvation in answer to our cry
 and now see the children of ammon and moab and the people of mount seir whom you kept israel from attacking when they came out of egypt so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them
 see now how as our reward they have come to send us out of your land which you have given us as our heritage
 o our god will you not be their judge for our strength is not equal to this great army which is coming against us and we are at a loss what to do but our eyes are on you
 and all judah were waiting before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children
 then before all the meeting the spirit of the lord came on jahaziel the son of zechariah son of benaiah son of jeiel son of mattaniah a levite and one of the family of asaph
 and he said give ear o judah and you people of jerusalem and you king jehoshaphat the lord says to you have no fear and do not be troubled on account of this great army for the fight is not yours but gods
 go down against them tomorrow see they are coming up by the slope of ziz at the end of the valley before the waste land of jeruel you will come face to face with them
 there will be no need for you to take up arms in this fight put yourselves in position and keep where you are and you will see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem have no fear and do not be troubled go out against them tomorrow for the lord is with you
 then jehoshaphat went down with his face to the earth and all judah and the people of jerusalem gave worship to the lord falling down before him
 and the levites the children of the kohathites and the korahites got to their feet and gave praise to the lord the god of israel with a loud voice
 and early in the morning they got up and went out to the waste land of tekoa and when they were going out jehoshaphat took his station and said to them give ear to me o judah and you people of jerusalem have faith in the lord your god and you will be safe have faith in his prophets and all will go well for you
 and after discussion with the people he put in their places those who were to make melody to the lord praising him in holy robes while they went at the head of the army and saying may the lord be praised for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and at the first notes of song and praise the lord sent a surprise attack against the children of ammon and moab and the people of mount seir who had come against judah and they were overcome
 and the children of ammon and moab made an attack on the people of mount seir with a view to their complete destruction and when they had put an end to the people of seir everymans hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction
