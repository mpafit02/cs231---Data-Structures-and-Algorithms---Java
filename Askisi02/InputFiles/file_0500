 if he takes his oath before the lord that he has not put his hand to his neighbours goods the owner is to take his word for it and he will not have to make payment for it
 but if it is taken from him by a thief he is to make up for the loss of it to its owner
 but if it has been damaged by a beast and he is able to make this clear he will not have to make payment for what was damaged
 if a man gets from his neighbour the use of one of his beasts and it is damaged or put to death when the owner is not with it he will certainly have to make payment for the loss
 if the owner is with it he will not have to make payment if he gave money for the use of it the loss is covered by the payment
 if a man takes a virgin who has not given her word to another man and has connection with her he will have to give a bride price for her to be his wife
 if her father will not give her to him on any account he will have to give the regular payment for virgins
 any woman using unnatural powers or secret arts is to be put to death
 any man who has sex connection with a beast is to be put to death
 complete destruction will come on any man who makes offerings to any other god but the lord
 do no wrong to a man from a strange country and do not be hard on him for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of egypt
 do no wrong to a widow or to a child whose father is dead
 if you are cruel to them in any way and their cry comes up to me i will certainly give ear
 and in the heat of my wrath i will put you to death with the sword so that your wives will be widows and your children without fathers
 if you let any of the poor among my people have the use of your money do not be a hard creditor to him and do not take interest
 if ever you take your neighbours clothing in exchange for the use of your money let him have it back before the sun goes down
 for it is the only thing he has for covering his skin what is he to go to sleep in and when his cry comes up to me i will give ear for my mercy is great
 you may not say evil of the judges or put a curse on the ruler of your people
 do not keep back your offerings from the wealth of your grain and your vines the first of your sons you are to give to me
 in the same way with your oxen and your sheep for seven days let the young one be with its mother on the eighth day give it to me
 you are to be holy men to me the flesh of no animal whose death has been caused by the beasts of the field may be used for your food it is to be given to the dogs
 do not let a false statement go further do not make an agreement with evil doers to be a false witness
 do not be moved to do wrong by the general opinion or give the support of your words to a wrong decision
 but on the other hand do not be turned from what is right in order to give support to a poor mans cause
 if you come across the ox or the ass of one who is no friend to you wandering from its way you are to take it back to him
 if you see the ass of one who has no love for you bent down to the earth under the weight which is put on it you are to come to its help even against your desire
 let no wrong decisions be given in the poor mans cause
 keep yourselves far from any false business never let the upright or him who has done no wrong be put to death for i will make the evil doer responsible for his sin
 take no rewards in a cause for rewards make blind those who have eyes to see and make the decisions of the upright false
 do not be hard on the man from a strange country who is living among you for you have had experience of the feelings of one who is far from the land of his birth because you yourselves were living in egypt in a strange land
