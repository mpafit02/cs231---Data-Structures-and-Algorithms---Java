 he has made ready for him the instruments of death he makes his arrows flames of fire
 that man is a worker of evil the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit
 he has made a hole deep in the earth and is falling into the hole which he has made
 his wrongdoing will come back to him and his violent behaviour will come down on his head
 i will give praise to the lord for his righteousness i will make a song to the name of the lord most high
 &ltto the chief music maker of david to keep in memory&gt let your salvation come quickly o god come quickly to my help o lord
 let those who go after my soul have shame and trouble let those who have evil designs against me be turned back and made foolish
 let those who say aha aha  be turned back as a reward of their shame
 let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you let the lovers of your salvation ever say may god be great
 but i am poor and in need come to me quickly o god you are my help and my saviour let there be no waiting o lord
 in you o lord have i put my hope let me never be shamed
 keep me safe in your righteousness and come to my help give ear to my voice and be my saviour
 be my strong rock the strong place of my salvation for you are my rock and my safe place
 o my god take me out of the hand of the sinner out of the hand of the evil and cruel man
 for you are my hope o lord god i have had faith in you from the time when i was young
 you have been my support from the day of my birth you took me out of my mothers body my praise will be ever of you
 i am a wonder to all but you are my strong tower
 my mouth will be full of your praise and glory all the day
 do not give me up when i am old be my help even when my strength is gone
 for my haters are waiting secretly for me and those who are watching for my soul are banded together in their evil designs
 saying god has given him up go after him and take him for he has no helper
 o god be not far from me o my god come quickly to my help
 let those who say evil against my soul be overcome and put to shame let my haters be made low and have no honour
 but i will go on ever hoping and increasing in all your praise
 my mouth will make clear your righteousness and your salvation all the day for they are more than may be measured
 i will give news of the great acts of the lord god my words will be of your righteousness and of yours only
 o god you have been my teacher from the time when i was young and i have been talking of your works of wonder even till now
 now when i am old and grey headed o god give me not up till i have made clear your strength to this generation and your power to all those to come
 your righteousness o god is very high you have done great things o god who is like you
 you who have sent great and bitter troubles on me will give me life again lifting me up from the deep waters of the underworld
