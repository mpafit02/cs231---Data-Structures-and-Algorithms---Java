 so he said to the representatives of ben hadad say to my lord the king all the orders you sent the first time i will do but this thing i may not do and the representatives went back with this answer
 then ben hadad sent to him saying may the gods punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands
 and the king of israel said in answer say to him the time for loud talk is not when a man is putting on his arms but when he is taking them off
 now when this answer was given to ben hadad he was drinking with the kings in the tents and he said to his men take up your positions so they put themselves in position for attacking the town
 then a prophet came up to ahab king of israel and said the lord says have you seen all this great army see i will give it into your hands today and you will see that i am the lord
 and ahab said by whom and he said the lord says by the servants of the chiefs who are over the divisions of the land then he said by whom is the fighting to be started and he made answer by you
 then he got together the servants of all the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land two hundred and thirty two of them and after them he got together all the people all the children of israel seven thousand
 and in the middle of the day they went out but ben hadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty two kings who were helping him
 and the servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first and when ben hadad sent out they gave him the news saying men have come out from samaria
 and he said if they have come out for peace take them living and if they have come out for war take them living
 so the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town with the army coming after them
 and every one of them put his man to death and the aramaeans went in flight with israel after them and ben hadad king of aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen
 and the king of israel went out and took the horses and the war carriages and made great destruction among the aramaeans
 then the prophet came up to the king of israel and said to him now make yourself strong and take care what you do or a year from now the king of aram will come up against you again
 then the king of arams servants said to him their god is a god of the hills that is why they were stronger than we but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands we will certainly be stronger than they
 this is what you have to do take away the kings from their positions and put captains in their places
 and get together another army like the one which came to destruction horse for horse and carriage for carriage and let us make war on them in the lowlands and certainly we will be stronger than they and he gave ear to what they said and did so
 so a year later ben hadad got the aramaeans together and went up to aphek to make war on israel
 and the children of israel got themselves together and food was made ready and they went against them the tents of the children of israel were like two little flocks of goats before them but all the country was full of the aramaeans
 and a man of god came up and said to the king of israel the lord says because the aramaeans have said the lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys i will give all this great army into your hands and you will see that i am the lord
 now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days and on the seventh day the fight was started and the children of israel put to the sword a hundred thousand aramaean footmen in one day
 but the rest went in flight to aphek into the town where a wall came down on the twenty seven thousand who were still living and ben hadad went in flight into the town into an inner room
 then his servants said to him it is said that the kings of israel are full of mercy let us then put on haircloth and cords on our heads and go to the king of israel it may be that he will give you your life
 so they put on haircloth and cords on their heads and came to the king of israel and said your servant ben hadad says let me now keep my life and he said is he still living he is my brother
 now the men took it as a sign and quickly took up his words and they said ben hadad is your brother then he said go and get him so ben hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage
 and ben hadad said to him the towns my father took from your father i will give back and you may make streets for yourself in damascus as my father did in samaria and as for me at the price of this agreement you will let me go so he made an agreement with him and let him go
 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the lord give me a wound but the man would not
 then he said to him because you have not given ear to the voice of the lord straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death and when he had gone straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death
 then he came across another man and said give me a wound and the man gave him a blow wounding him
 so the prophet went away and pulling his head band over his eyes to keep his face covered took his place by the road waiting for the king
