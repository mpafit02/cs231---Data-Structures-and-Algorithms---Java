 and david took more women and wives in jerusalem after he had come from hebron and he had more sons and daughters
 these are the names of those whose birth took place in jerusalem shammua and shobab and nathan and solomon
 and ibhar and elishua and nepheg and japhia
 and elishama and eliada and eliphelet
 and when the philistines had news that david had been made king over israel they all went up in search of david and david hearing of it went down to the strong place
 and when the philistines came they went in every direction in the valley of rephaim
 and david desiring directions from the lord said am i to go up against the philistines will you give them up into my hands and the lord said go up for i will certainly give up the philistines into your hands
 and david went to baal perazim and overcame them there and he said the lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters so that place was named baal perazim
 and the philistines when they went in flight did not take their images with them and david and his men took them away
 and the philistines came up again and went in every direction in the valley of rephaim
 and when david went for directions to the lord he said you are not to go up against them in front but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice trees
 then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go forward quickly for the lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the philistines
 and david did as the lord had said and he overcame the philistines attacking them from gibeon to near gezer
 and david got together all the fighting men of israel to the number of thirty thousand
 and david and all the people who were with him went to baal of judah to get the ark of god over which the holy name is named the name of the lord of armies whose place is between the winged ones
 and they put the ark of god on a new cart and took it out of the house of abinadab which was on the hill and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab were the drivers of the cart
 and uzzah went by the side of the ark while ahio went before it
 and david and all the men of israel made melody before the lord with all their power with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass
 and when they came to nacons grain floor uzzah put his hand on the ark of god to keep it safe in its place for the oxen were out of control
 and the wrath of the lord burning against uzzah sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there by the ark of god
 and david was angry because of the lords outburst of wrath against uzzah and he gave that place the name perez uzzah which is its name to this day
 and such was davids fear of the lord that day that he said how may i let the ark of god come to me
 so david did not let the ark of the lord come back to him to the town of david but had it turned away and put into the house of obed edom the gittite
 and the ark of the lord was in the house of obed edom the gittite for three months and the lord sent a blessing on obed edom and all his family
 and they said to king david the blessing of the lord is on the family of obed edom and on all he has because of the ark of god and david went and took the ark of god from the house of obed edom into the town of david with joy
 and when those who were lifting the ark of the lord had gone six steps he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast
 and david clothed in a linen ephod was dancing before the lord with all his strength
 so david and all the men of israel took up the ark of the lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns
 and when the ark of the lord came into the town of david michal sauls daughter looking out of the window saw king david dancing and jumping before the lord and to her mind he seemed foolish
 and they took in the ark of the lord and put it in its place inside the tent which david had put up for it and david made burned offerings and peace offerings to the lord
