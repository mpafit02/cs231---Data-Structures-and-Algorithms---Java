 o you who are living in lebanon making your living place in the cedars how greatly to be pitied will you be when pains come on you as on a woman in childbirth 
 by my life says the lord even if coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah was the ring on my right hand even from there i would have you pulled off
 and i will give you into the hands of those desiring your death and into the hands of those whom you are fearing even into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of the chaldaeans
 i will send you out and your mother who gave you birth into another country not the land of your birth and there death will come to you
 but to the land on which their souls desire is fixed they will never come back
 is this man coniah a broken vessel of no value is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure why are they violently sent out he and his seed into a land which is strange to them
 o earth earth earth give ear to the word of the lord 
 the lord has said let this man be recorded as having no children a man who will not do well in all his life for no man of his seed will do well seated on the seat of the kingdom of david and ruling again in judah
 a curse is on the keepers who are causing the destruction and loss of the sheep of my field says the lord
 so this is what the lord the god of israel has said against the keepers who have the care of my people you have let my flock be broken up driving them away and not caring for them see i will send on you the punishment for the evil of your doings says the lord
 and i will get the rest of my flock together from all the countries where i have sent them and will make them come back again to their resting place and they will have offspring and be increased
 and i will put over them keepers who will take care of them never again will they be overcome with fear or be troubled and there will not be the loss of one of them says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will give to david a true branch and he will be ruling as king acting wisely doing what is right and judging uprightly in the land
 in his days judah will have salvation and israel will be living without fear and this is the name by which he will be named the lord is our righteousness
 and so truly the days are coming when they will say no longer by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of egypt
 but by the living lord who took up the seed of israel and made them come out of the north country and from all the countries where i had sent them and they will be living in the land which is theirs
 about the prophets my heart is broken in me all my bones are shaking i am like a man full of strong drink like a man overcome by wine because of the lord and because of his holy words
 for the land is full of men who are untrue to their wives because of the curse the land is full of grief the green fields of the waste land have become dry and they are quick to do evil their strength is for what is not right
 for the prophet as well as the priest is unclean even in my house i have seen their evil doing says the lord
 for this cause their steps will be slipping on their way they will be forced on into the dark and have a fall there for i will send evil on them in the year of their punishment says the lord
 and i have seen ways without sense in the prophets of samaria they became prophets of the baal causing my people israel to go wrong
 and in the prophets of jerusalem i have seen a shocking thing they are untrue to their wives walking in deceit and they make strong the hands of evil doers so that a man may not be turned back from his evil doing they have all become like sodom to me and its people like gomorrah
 so this is what the lord of armies has said about the prophets see i will give them a bitter plant for their food and bitter water for their drink for from the prophets of jerusalem unclean behaviour has gone out into all the land
 this is what the lord of armies has said do not give ear to the words which the prophets say to you they give you teaching of no value it is from themselves that their vision comes and not out of the mouth of the lord
 they keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the lord you will have peace and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart they say no evil will come to you
 for which of them has knowledge of the secret of the lord and has seen him and given ear to his word which of them has taken note of his word and given attention to it
 see the storm wind of the lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evil doers
 the wrath of the lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
 i did not send these prophets but they went running i said nothing to them but they gave out the prophets word
 but if they had been in my secret then they would have made my people give ear to my words turning them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings
