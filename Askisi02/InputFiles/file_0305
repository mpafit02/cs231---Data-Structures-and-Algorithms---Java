 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the evil ways of jeroboam and the sin which he made israel do
 and the word of the lord came to jehu son of hanani protesting against baasha and saying
 because i took you up out of the dust and made you ruler over my people israel and you have gone in the ways of jeroboam and made my people israel do evil moving me to wrath by their sins
 truly i will see that baasha and all his family are completely brushed away i will make your family like the family of jeroboam the son of nebat
 anyone of the family of baasha who comes to death in the town will become food for the dogs and he to whom death comes in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and baasha went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth at tirzah and elah his son became king in his place
 and the lord sent his word against baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet jehu the son of hanani because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath by the work of his hands because he was like the family of jeroboam and because he put it to death
 in the twenty sixth year that asa was king of judah elah the son of baasha became king of israel in tirzah and he was king for two years
 and his servant zimri captain of half his war carriages made secret designs against him now he was in tirzah drinking hard in the house of arza controller of the kings house in tirzah
 and zimri went in and made an attack on him and put him to death in the twenty seventh year that asa was king of judah and made himself king in his place
 and straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom he put to death all the family of baasha not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life
 so zimri put to death all the family of baasha so that the word which the lord said against him by the mouth of jehu the prophet came about
 because of all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son which they did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath by their foolish acts
 now the rest of the acts of elah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah zimri was king for seven days in tirzah now the people were attacking gibbethon in the land of the philistines
 and news came to the people in the tents that zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death so all israel made omri the captain of the army king that day in the tents
 then omri went up from gibbethon with all the army of israel and they made an attack on tirzah shutting in the town on every side
 and when zimri saw that the town was taken he went into the inner room of the kings house and burning the house over his head came to his end
 because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the lord in going in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he made israel do
 now the rest of the acts of zimri and the secret design he made are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 then there was a division among the people of israel half the people were for making tibni son of ginath king and half were supporting omri
 but the supporters of omri overcame those who were on the side of tibni the son of ginath and death came to tibni and to his brother joram at that time and omri became king in the place of tibni
 in the thirty first year of asa king of judah omri became king over israel and he was king for twelve years for six years he was ruling in tirzah
 he got the hill samaria from shemer for the price of two talents of silver and he made a town there building it on the hill and naming it samaria after shemer the owner of the hill
 and omri did evil in the eyes of the lord even worse than all those before him
 copying all the evil ways of jeroboam the son of nebat and all the sins he did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath by their foolish ways
 now the rest of the acts which omri did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 so omri went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and ahab his son became king in his place
 in the thirty eighth year that asa was king of judah ahab the son of omri became king over israel and ahab was king in samaria for twenty two years
