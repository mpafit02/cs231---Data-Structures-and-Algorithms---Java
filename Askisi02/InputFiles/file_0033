 why because i have no love for you let god be judge
 but what i do that i will go on doing so that i may give no chance to those who are looking for one so that in the cause of their pride they may be seen to be the same as we are
 for such men are false apostles workers of deceit making themselves seem like apostles of christ
 and it is no wonder for even satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light
 so it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness whose end will be the reward of their works
 i say again let me not seem foolish to anyone but if i do put up with me as such so that i may take a little glory to myself
 what i am now saying is not by the order of the lord but as a foolish person taking credit to myself as it seems
 seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh i will do the same
 for you put up with the foolish gladly being wise yourselves
 you put up with a man if he makes servants of you if he makes profit out of you if he makes you prisoners if he puts himself in a high place if he gives you blows on the face
 i say this by way of shaming ourselves as if we had been feeble but if anyone puts himself forward  i am talking like a foolish person  i will do the same
 are they hebrews so am i are they of israel so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i
 are they servants of christ  i am talking foolishly  i am more so i have had more experience of hard work of prisons of blows more than measure of death
 five times the jews gave me forty blows but one
 three times i was whipped with rods once i was stoned three times the ship i was in came to destruction at sea a night and a day i have been in the water
 in frequent travels in dangers on rivers in dangers from outlaws in dangers from my countrymen in dangers from the gentiles in dangers in the town in dangers in the waste land in dangers at sea in dangers among false brothers
 in hard work and weariness in frequent watchings going without food and drink cold and in need of clothing
 in addition to all the other things there is that which comes on me every day the care of all the churches
 who is feeble and i am not feeble who is in danger of falling and i am not angry
 if i have to take credit to myself i will do so in the things in which i am feeble
 the god and father of our lord jesus christ to whom be praise for ever is witness that the things which i say are true
 in damascus the ruler under aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of damascus in order to take me
 and being let down in a basket from the wall through a window i got free from his hands
 as it is necessary for me to take glory to myself though it is not a good thing i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
 i have knowledge of a man in christ fourteen years back  if he was in the body or out of the body i am not able to say but god only  who was taken up to the third heaven
 and i have knowledge of such a man  if he was in the body or out of the body i am not able to say but god only 
 how he was taken up into paradise and words came to his ears which may not be said and which man is not able to say
 on account of such a one i will have glory for myself i will take no glory but only in my feeble body
 for if i had a desire to take credit to myself it would not be foolish for i would be saying what is true but i will not for fear that i might seem to any man more than he sees me to be or has word from me that i am
 and because the revelations were so very great in order that i might not be overmuch lifted up there was given to me a thorn in the flesh one sent from satan to give me pain
