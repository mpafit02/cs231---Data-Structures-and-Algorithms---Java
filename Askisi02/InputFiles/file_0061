 crying out men of israel come to our help this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place and in addition he has taken greeks into the temple and made this holy place unclean
 for they had seen him before in the town with trophimus of ephesus and had the idea that paul had taken him with him into the temple
 and all the town was moved and the people came running together and put their hands on paul pulling him out of the temple and then the doors were shut
 and while they were attempting to put him to death news came to the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was out of control
 and straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them and the jews seeing them gave no more blows to paul
 then the chief captain came near and took him and gave orders for him to be put in chains questioning them as to who he was and what he had done
 and some said one thing and some another among the people and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise he gave orders for paul to be taken into the army building
 and when he came on to the steps he was lifted up by the armed men because of the force of the people
 for a great mass of people came after them crying out away with him 
 and when paul was about to be taken into the building he said to the chief captain may i say something to you and he said have you a knowledge of greek
 are you by chance the egyptian who before this got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the assassins out into the waste land
 but paul said i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia which is not an unimportant town i make a request to you to let me say a word to the people
 and when he let him do so paul from the steps made a sign with his hand to the people and when they were all quiet he said to them in the hebrew language
 my brothers and fathers give ear to the story of my life which i now put before you
 and hearing him talking in the hebrew language they became the more quiet and he said
 i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia by birth but i had my education in this town at the feet of gamaliel being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers given up to the cause of god with all my heart as you are today
 and i made attacks on this way even to death taking men and women and putting them in prison
 of which the high priest will be a witness and all the rulers from whom i had letters to the brothers and i went into damascus to take those who were there as prisoners to jerusalem for punishment
 and it came about that while i was on my journey coming near to damascus about the middle of the day suddenly i saw a great light from heaven shining round me
 and when i went down on the earth a voice came to my ears saying to me saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
 and i answering said who are you lord and he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are attacking
 and those who were with me saw the light but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears
 and i said what have i to do lord and the lord said to me get up and go into damascus and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
 and because i was unable to see because of the glory of that light those who were with me took me by the hand and so i came to damascus
 and one ananias a god fearing man who kept the law and of whom all the jews in that place had a high opinion
 came to my side and said brother saul let your eyes be open and in that very hour i was able to see him
 and he said you have been marked out by the god of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose and to see the upright one and to give ear to the words of his mouth
 for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears
 and now why are you waiting get up and have baptism for the washing away of your sins giving worship to his name
 and it came about that when i had come back to jerusalem while i was at prayer in the temple my senses became more than naturally clear
