 which are dark because of the ice and the snow falling into them
 under the burning sun they are cut off and come to nothing because of the heat
 the camel trains go out of their way they go up into the waste and come to destruction
 the camel trains of tema were searching with care the bands of sheba were waiting for them
 they were put to shame because of their hope they came and their hope was gone
 so have you now become to me you see my sad condition and are in fear
 did i say give me something or make a payment for me out of your wealth
 or get me out of the power of my hater or give money so that i may be free from the power of the cruel ones
 give me teaching and i will be quiet and make me see my error
 how pleasing are upright words  but what force is there in your arguments
 my words may seem wrong to you but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind
 truly you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors and would make a profit out of your friend
 now then let your eyes be turned to me for truly i will not say what is false to your face
 let your minds be changed and do not have an evil opinion of me yes be changed for my righteousness is still in me
 is there evil in my tongue is not the cause of my trouble clear to me
 has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment
 as a servant desiring the shades of evening and a workman looking for his payment
 so i have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose and nights of weariness are given to me
 when i go to my bed i say when will it be time to get up but the night is long and i am turning from side to side till morning light
 my flesh is covered with worms and dust my skin gets hard and then is cracked again
 my days go quicker than the cloth workers thread and come to an end without hope
 o keep in mind that my life is wind my eye will never again see good
 the eye of him who sees me will see me no longer your eyes will be looking for me but i will be gone
 a cloud comes to an end and is gone so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again
 he will not come back to his house and his place will have no more knowledge of him
 so i will not keep my mouth shut i will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit my soul will make a bitter outcry
 am i a sea or a sea beast that you put a watch over me
 when i say in my bed i will have comfort there i will get rest from my disease
 then you send dreams to me and visions of fear
 so that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains
