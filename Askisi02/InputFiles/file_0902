 and the priest will put these curses in a book washing out the writing with the bitter water
 and he will give to the woman the bitter water for drink and the bitter water causing the curse will go into her
 and the priest will take from her hand the meal offering of doubt waving it before the lord and will take it to the altar
 and he will take some of it in his hand burning it on the altar as a sign and then he will give the woman the bitter water
 and it will be that if the woman has become unclean sinning against her husband when she has taken the bitter water it will go into her body causing disease of the stomach and wasting of the legs and she will be a curse among her people
 but if she is clean she will be free and will have offspring
 this is the law for testing a wife who goes with another in place of her husband and becomes unclean
 or for a husband who in a bitter spirit has doubts in his heart about his wife let him take her to the priest who will put in force this law
 then the man will be free from all wrong and the womans sin will be on her
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a man or a woman takes an oath to keep himself separate and give himself to the lord
 he is to keep himself from wine and strong drink and take no mixed wine or strong drink or any drink made from grapes or any grapes green or dry
 all the time he is separate he may take nothing made from the grape vine from its seeds to its skin
 all the time he is under his oath let no blade come near his head till the days while he is separate are ended he is holy and his hair may not be cut
 all the time he is separate he may not come near any dead body
 he may not make himself unclean for his father or his mother his sister or his brother if death comes to them because he is under an oath to keep himself separate for god
 all the time he is separate he is holy to the lord
 if death comes suddenly to a man at his side so that he becomes unclean let his hair be cut off on the day when he is made clean on the seventh day
 and on the eighth day let him take to the priest at the door of the tent of meeting two doves or two young pigeons
 and the priest will give one for a sin offering and the other for a burned offering to take away the sin which came on him on account of the dead and he will make his head holy that same day
 and he will give to the lord his days of being separate offering a he lamb of the first year as an offering for error but the earlier days will be a loss because he became unclean
 and this is the law for him who is separate when the necessary days are ended he is to come to the door of the tent of meeting
 and make his offering to the lord one he lamb of the first year without a mark for a burned offering and one female lamb of the first year without a mark for a sin offering and one male sheep without a mark for peace offerings
 and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of the best meal mixed with oil and thin unleavened cakes covered with oil with their meal offering and drink offerings
 and the priest will take them before the lord and make his sin offering and his burned offering
 giving the sheep of the peace offerings with the basket of unleavened bread and at the same time the priest will make his meal offering and his drink offering
 then let his long hair the sign of his oath be cut off at the door of the tent of meeting and let him put it on the fire on which the peace offerings are burning
 and the priest will take the cooked leg of the sheep and one unleavened cake and one thin cake out of the basket and put them on the hands of the separate one after his hair has been cut
 waving them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest together with the waved breast and the leg which is lifted up after that the man may take wine
 this is the law for him who takes an oath to keep himself separate and for his offering to the lord on that account in addition to what he may be able to get this is the law of his oath which he will have to keep
