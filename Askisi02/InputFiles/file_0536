 who has kept his hand from evil doing and has not taken interest or great profits who has done my orders and been guided by my rules he will certainly not be put to death for the evil doing of his father life will certainly be his
 as for his father because he was cruel took goods by force and did what is not good among his people truly death will overtake him in his evil doing
 but you say why does not the son undergo punishment for the evil doing of the father when the son has done what is ordered and right and has kept my rules and done them life will certainly be his
 the soul which does sin will be put to death the son will not be made responsible for the evil doing of the father or the father for the evil doing of the son the righteousness of the upright will be on himself and the evil doing of the evil doer on himself
 but if the evil doer turning away from all the sins which he has done keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
 not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him in the righteousness which he has done he will have life
 have i any pleasure in the death of the evil doer says the lord am i not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life
 but when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil like all the disgusting things which the evil man does will he have life not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him
 but you say the way of the lord is not equal give ear now o children of israel is my way not equal are not your ways unequal
 when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in the evil which he has done death will overtake him
 again when the evil doer turning away from the evil he has done does what is ordered and right he will have life for his soul
 because he had fear and was turned away from all the wrong which he had done life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
 but still the children of israel say the way of the lord is not equal o children of israel are my ways not equal are not your ways unequal
 for this cause i will be your judge o children of israel judging every man by his ways says the lord come back and be turned from all your sins so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil
 put away all your evil doing in which you have done sin and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit why are you desiring death o children of israel
 for i have no pleasure in the death of him on whom death comes says the lord be turned back then and have life
 take up now a song of grief for the ruler of israel and say
 what was your mother like a she lion among lions stretched out among the young lions she gave food to her little ones
 and one of her little ones came to growth under her care and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
 and the nations had news of him he was taken in the hole they had made and pulling him with hooks they took him into the land of egypt
 now when she saw that her hope was made foolish and gone she took another of her little ones and made him into a young lion
 and he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
 and he sent destruction on their widows and made waste their towns and the land and everything in it became waste because of the loud sound of his voice
 then the nations came against him from the kingdoms round about their net was stretched over him and he was taken in the hole they had made
 they made him a prisoner with hooks and took him to the king of babylon they put him in the strong place so that his voice might be sounding no longer on the mountains of israel
 your mother was in comparison like a vine planted by the waters she was fertile and full of branches because of the great waters
 and she had a strong rod for a rod of authority for the rulers and it became tall among the clouds and it was seen lifted up among the number of its branches
 but she was uprooted in burning wrath and made low on the earth the east wind came drying her up and her branches were broken off her strong rod became dry the fire made a meal of it
 and now she is planted in the waste land in a dry and unwatered country
 and fire has gone out from her rod causing the destruction of her branches so that there is no strong rod in her to be the rulers rod of authority this is a song of grief and it was for a song of grief
