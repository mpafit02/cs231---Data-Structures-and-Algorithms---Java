 now there was a man named joseph a man of authority and a good and upright man
  he had not given his approval to their decision or their acts  of arimathaea a town of the jews who was waiting for the kingdom of god
 this man went to pilate and made a request for the body of jesus
 and he took it down and folding it in a linen cloth he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body and no one had ever been put in it
 now it was the day of making ready and the sabbath was coming on
 and the women who had come with him from galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest
 and they went back and got ready spices and perfumes and on the sabbath they took their rest in agreement with the law
 but on the first day of the week at dawn they came to the place where his body had been put taking the spices which they had got ready
 and they saw that the stone had been rolled away
 and they went in but the body of the lord jesus was not there
 and while they were in doubt about it they saw two men in shining clothing by them
 and while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear these said to them why are you looking for the living among the dead
 he is not here he has come back to life have in mind what he said to you when he was still in galilee saying
 the son of man will be given up into the hands of evil doers and be put to death on the cross and on the third day he will come back to life
 and his words came back into their minds
 and they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others
 now they were mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and the other women with them said these things to the apostles
 but these words seemed foolish to them and they had no belief in them
 but peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place
 and then two of them on that very day were going to a little town named emmaus which was about seven miles from jerusalem
 and they were talking together about all those things which had taken place
 and while they were talking and questioning together jesus himself came near and went with them
 but their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him
 and he said to them what are you talking about together while you go
 then stopping and looking sadly at him one of them named cleopas said to him are you the only man living in jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time
 and he said to them what things and they said the things to do with jesus of nazareth who was a prophet great in his acts and his words before god and all the people
 and how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross
 but we were hoping that he would be the saviour of israel in addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place
 and certain women among us gave us cause for wonder for they went early to the place where his body had been put
 and it was not there then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living
