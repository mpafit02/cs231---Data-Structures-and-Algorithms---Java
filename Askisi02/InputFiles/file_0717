 for this cause i will give cries of grief for moab crying out for moab even for all of it i will be sorrowing for the men of kir heres
 my weeping for you o vine of sibmah will be more than the weeping of jazer your branches have gone over the sea stretching even to jazer destruction has come down on your summer fruits and your cut grapes
 all joy is gone no longer are they glad for the fertile field and for the land of moab i have made the wine come to an end from the crushing vessels no longer will the grapes be crushed with the sound of glad voices
 the cry of heshbon comes even to elealeh to jahaz their voice is sounding from zoar even to horonaim and to eglath shelishiyah for the waters of nimrim will become dry
 and i will put an end in moab says the lord to him who is making offerings in the high place and burning perfumes to his gods
 so my heart is sounding for moab like the sound of pipes and my heart is sounding like pipes for the men of kir heres for the wealth he has got for himself has come to an end
 for everywhere the hair of the head and the hair of the face is cut off on every hand there are wounds and haircloth on every body
 on all the house tops of moab and in its streets there is weeping everywhere for moab has been broken like a vessel in which there is no pleasure says the lord
 how is it broken down  how is moabs back turned in shame  so moab will be a cause of sport and of fear to everyone round about him
 for the lord has said see he will come like an eagle in flight stretching out his wings against moab
 kerioth is taken and the strong places have been forced and the hearts of moabs men of war in that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth pains
 and moab will come to an end as a people because he has been lifting himself up against the lord
 fear and death and the net have come on you o people of moab says the lord
 he who goes in flight from the fear will be overtaken by death and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net for i will make this come on moab even the year of their punishment says the lord
 those who went in flight from the fear are waiting under the shade of heshbon for a fire has gone out from heshbon and a flame from the house of sihon burning up the pride of moab and the crown of the head of the violent ones
 sorrow is yours o moab  the people of chemosh are overcome for your sons have been taken away as prisoners and your daughters made servants
 but still i will let the fate of moab be changed in the last days says the lord
 about the children of ammon these are the words of the lord has israel no sons has he no one to take the heritage why then has milcom taken gad for himself putting his people in its towns
 because of this see the days are coming when i will have a cry of war sounded against rabbah the town of the children of ammon it will become a waste of broken walls and her daughter towns will be burned with fire then israel will take the heritage of those who took his heritage says the lord
 make sounds of grief o heshbon for ai is wasted give loud cries o daughters of rabbah and put haircloth round you give yourselves to weeping running here and there and wounding yourselves for milcom will be taken prisoner together with his rulers and his priests
 why are you lifted up in pride on account of your valleys your flowing valley o daughter ever turning away who puts her faith in her wealth saying who will come against me
 see i will send fear on you says the lord the lord of armies from those who are round you on every side you will be forced out every man straight before him and there will be no one to get together the wanderers
 but after these things i will let the fate of the children of ammon be changed says the lord
 about edom this is what the lord of armies has said is there no more wisdom in teman have wise suggestions come to an end among men of good sense has their wisdom completely gone
 go in flight go back take cover in deep places you who are living in dedan for i will send the fate of edom on him even the time of his punishment
 if men came to get your grapes would they not let some be uncut on the vines if thieves came by night would they not make waste till they had enough
 i have had esau searched out uncovering his secret places so that he may not keep himself covered his seed is wasted and has come to an end and there is no help from his neighbours
 put in my care your children who have no father and i will keep them safe and let your widows put their faith in me
 for the lord has said those for whom the cup was not made ready will certainly be forced to take of it and are you to go without punishment you will not be without punishment but will certainly be forced to take from the cup
 for i have taken an oath by myself says the lord that bozrah will become a cause of wonder a name of shame a waste and a curse and all its towns will be waste places for ever
