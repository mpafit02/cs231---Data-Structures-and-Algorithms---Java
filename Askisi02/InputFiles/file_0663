 but as for you israel my servant and you jacob whom i have taken for myself the seed of abraham my friend
 you whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and sent for from its farthest parts saying to you you are my servant whom i have taken for myself and whom i have not given up
 have no fear for i am with you do not be looking about in trouble for i am your god i will give you strength yes i will be your helper yes my true right hand will be your support
 truly all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen
 you will make search for your haters but they will not be there those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction
 for i the lord your god have taken your right hand in mine saying to you have no fear i will be your helper
 have no fear you worm jacob and you men of israel i will be your helper says the lord even he who takes up your cause the holy one of israel
 see i will make you like a new grain crushing instrument with teeth crushing the mountains small and making the hills like dry stems
 you will send the wind over them and it will take them away they will go in all directions before the storm wind you will have joy in the lord and be glad in the holy one of israel
 the poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is and their tongue is dry for need of it i the lord will give ear to their prayer i the god of israel will not give them up
 i will make rivers on the dry mountain tops and fountains in the valleys i will make the waste land a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
 i will put in the waste land the cedar the acacia the myrtle and the olive tree and in the lowland will be planted the fir tree the plane and the cypress together
 so that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the lord has done this and that the holy one of israel has made it
 put forward your cause says the lord let your strong argument come out says the king of jacob
 let the future be made clear to us give us news of the past things so that we may give thought to them or of the things to come so that we may see if they are true
 give us word of what will be after this so that we may be certain that you are gods yes do good or do evil so that we may all see it and be surprised
 but you are nothing and your work is of no value foolish is he who takes you for his gods
 i have sent for one from the north and from the dawn he has come in my name he will get rulers together and go against them they will be like dust even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter
 who has given knowledge of it from the first so that we may be certain of it and from the start so that we may say his word is true there is no one who gives news or says anything or who gives ear to your words
 i was the first to give word of it to zion and i gave the good news to jerusalem
 and i saw that there was no man even no wise man among them who might give an answer to my questions
 truly they are all nothing their works are nothing and of no value their metal images are of no more use than wind
 see my servant whom i am supporting my loved one in whom i take delight i have put my spirit on him he will give the knowledge of the true god to the nations
 he will make no cry his voice will not be loud his words will not come to mens ears in the streets
 he will not let a crushed stem be quite broken and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples
 his light will not be put out and he will not be crushed till he has given the knowledge of the true god to the earth and the sea lands will be waiting for his teaching
 god the lord even he who made the heavens measuring them out on high stretching out the earth and giving its produce he who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who go about on it says
 i the lord have made you the vessel of my purpose i have taken you by the hand and kept you safe and i have given you to be an agreement to the people and a light to the nations
 to give eyes to the blind to make free the prisoners from the prison to let out those who are shut up in the dark
 i am the lord that is my name i will not give my glory to another or my praise to pictured images
