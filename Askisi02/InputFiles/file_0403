 but the chiefs of the children of ammon said to hanun their lord does it seem to you that david is honouring your father by sending comforters to you has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it and overcome it
 so hanun took davids servants and after cutting off half the hair on their chins and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle he sent them away
 when david had news of it he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way for the men were greatly shamed and the king said go to jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by david they sent to the aramaeans of beth rehob and zobah and got for payment twenty thousand footmen and they got from the king of maacah a thousand men and from tob twelve thousand
 and hearing of this david sent joab and all the army and the best fighting men
 and the children of ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town and the aramaeans of zobah and of rehob with the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the field
 now when joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took the best of the men of israel and put them in line against the aramaeans
 and the rest of the people he put in position against the children of ammon with abishai his brother at their head
 and he said if the aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then you are to come to my help but if the children of ammon get the better of you i will come to your help
 take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our god and may the lord do what seems good to him
 then joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the aramaeans and they went in flight before him
 and when the children of ammon saw the flight of the aramaeans they themselves went in flight from abishai and came into the town so joab went back from fighting the children of ammon and came to jerusalem
 and when the aramaeans saw that israel had overcome them they got themselves together
 and hadadezer sent for the aramaeans who were on the other side of the river and they came to helam with shobach the captain of hadadezers army at their head
 and word of this was given to david and he got all israel together and went over jordan and came to helam and the aramaeans put their forces in position against david and made an attack on him
 and the aramaeans went in flight before israel and david put to the sword the men of seven hundred aramaean war carriages and forty thousand footmen and shobach the captain of the army was wounded and came to his death there
 and when all the kings who were servants of hadadezer saw that they were overcome by israel they made peace with israel and became their servants so the aramaeans in fear gave no more help to the children of ammon
 now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war david sent joab and his servants and all israel with him and they made waste the land of the children of ammon and took up their position before rabbah shutting it in but david was still at jerusalem
 now one evening david got up from his bed and while he was walking on the roof of the kings house he saw from there a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful
 and david sent to get knowledge who the woman was and one said is this not bath sheba the daughter of eliam and wife of uriah the hittite
 and david sent and took her and she came to him and he took her to his bed  for she had been made clean  then she went back to her house
 and the woman became with child and she sent word to david that she was with child
 and david sent to joab saying send uriah the hittite to me and joab sent uriah to david
 and when uriah came to him david put questions to him about how joab and the people were and how the war was going
 and david said to uriah go down to your house and let your feet be washed and uriah went away from the kings house and an offering from the king was sent after him
 but uriah took his rest at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house
 and when word was given to david that uriah had not gone down to his house david said to uriah have you not come from a journey why did you not go down to your house
 and uriah said to david israel and judah with the ark are living in tents and my lord joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field and am i to go to my house and take food and drink and go to bed with my wife by the living lord and by the life of your soul i will not do such a thing
 and david said to uriah be here today and after that i will let you go so uriah was in jerusalem that day and the day after
 and when david sent for him he took meat and drink with him and david made him the worse for drink and when evening came he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord but he did not go down to his house
