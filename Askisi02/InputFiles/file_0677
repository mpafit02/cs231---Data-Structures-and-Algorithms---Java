 and though you were turned away from and hated and had no helper i will make you a pride for ever a joy from generation to generation
 and you will take the milk of the nations flowing from the breast of kings and you will see that i the lord am your saviour and he who takes up your cause the strong one of jacob
 in place of brass i will give gold and for iron silver and for wood brass and for stones iron and i will make peace your judge and righteousness your overseer
 violent acts will no longer be seen in your land wasting or destruction in your limits but your walls will be named salvation and your doors praise
 the sun will not be your light by day and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night but the lord will be to you an eternal light and your god your glory
 your sun will never again go down or your moon keep back her light for the lord will be your eternal light and the days of your sorrow will be ended
 your people will all be upright the land will be their heritage for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands to be for my glory
 the smallest of their families will become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will make it come quickly in its time
 the spirit of the lord is on me because i am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make the broken hearted well to say that the prisoners will be made free and that those in chains will see the light again
 to give knowledge that the year of the lords good pleasure has come and the day of punishment from our god to give comfort to all who are sad
 to give them a fair head dress in place of dust the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief praise in place of sorrow so that they may be named trees of righteousness the planting of the lord and so that he may have glory
 and they will be building again the old broken walls and will make new the old waste places and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations
 and men from strange countries will be your herdsmen and those who are not israelites will be your ploughmen and vine keepers
 but you will be named the priests of the lord the servants of our god you will have the wealth of the nations for your food and you will be clothed with their glory
 as they had twice as much grief and marks of shame were their heritage so in their land they will be rewarded twice over and will have eternal joy
 for i the lord take pleasure in upright judging i will not put up with the violent taking away of right and i will certainly give them their reward and i will make an eternal agreement with them
 and their seed will be noted among the nations and their offspring among the peoples it will be clear to all who see them that they are the seed to which the lord has given his blessing
 i will be full of joy in the lord my soul will be glad in my god for he has put on me the clothing of salvation covering me with the robe of righteousness as the husband puts on a fair head dress and the bride makes herself beautiful with jewels
 for as the earth puts out buds and as the garden gives growth to the seeds which are planted in it so the lord will make righteousness and praise to be flowering before all the nations
 because of zion i will not keep quiet and because of jerusalem i will take no rest till her righteousness goes out like the shining of the sun and her salvation like a burning light
 and the nations will see your righteousness and all kings your glory and you will have a new name given by the mouth of the lord
 and you will be a fair crown in the hand of the lord and a kings head dress in the hand of your god
 you will not now be named she who is given up and your land will no longer be named the waste land but you will have the name my pleasure is in her and your land will be named married for the lord has pleasure in you and your land will be married
 for as a young man takes a virgin for his wife so will your maker be married to you and as a husband has joy in his bride so will the lord your god be glad over you
 i have put watchmen on your walls o jerusalem they will not keep quiet day or night you who are the lords recorders take no rest
 and give him no rest till he puts jerusalem in her place to be praised in the earth
 the lord has taken an oath by his right hand and by the arm of his strength truly i will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has been done
 but those who have got in the grain will have it for their food and will give praise to the lord and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house
 go through go through the doors make ready the way of the people let the highway be lifted up let the stones be taken away let a flag be lifted up over the peoples
 the lord has sent out word to the end of the earth say to the daughter of zion see your saviour comes those whom he has made free are with him and those to whom he has given salvation go before him
