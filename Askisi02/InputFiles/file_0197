 take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick for the workman has a right to his food
 and into whatever town or small place you go make search there for someone who is respected and make his house your resting place till you go away
 and when you go in say may peace be on this house
 and if the house is good enough let your peace come on it but if not let your peace come back to you
 and whoever will not take you in or give ear to your words when you go out from that house or that town put off its dust from your feet
 truly i say to you it will be better for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of gods judging than for that town
 see i send you out as sheep among wolves be then as wise as snakes and as gentle as doves
 but be on the watch against men for they will give you up to the sanhedrins and in their synagogues they will give you blows
 and you will come before rulers and kings because of me for a witness to them and to the gentiles
 but when you are given up into their hands do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you
 because it is not you who say the words but the spirit of your father in you
 and brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
 and you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who is strong to the end will have salvation
 but when they are cruel to you in one town go in flight to another for truly i say to you you will not have gone through the towns of israel before the son of man comes
 a disciple is not greater than his master or a servant than his lord
 it is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have given the name beelzebub to the master of the house how much more to those of his house 
 have then no fear of them because nothing is covered which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
 what i say to you in the dark say in the light and what comes to your ear secretly say publicly from the house tops
 and have no fear of those who put to death the body but are not able to put to death the soul but have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell
 are not sparrows two a farthing and not one of them comes to an end without your father
 but the hairs of your head are all numbered
 then have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
 to everyone then who gives witness to me before men i will give witness before my father in heaven
 but if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me i will say that i have no knowledge of him before my father in heaven
 do not have the thought that i have come to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword
 for i have come to put a man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
 and a man will be hated by those of his house
 he who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me
 and he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me
 he who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
