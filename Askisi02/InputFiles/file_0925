 for fear that the lord may see it and it may be evil in his eyes and his wrath may be turned away from him
 do not be troubled because of evil doers or have envy of sinners
 for there will be no future for the evil man the light of sinners will be put out
 my son go in fear of the lord and the king have nothing to do with those who are in high positions
 for their downfall will come suddenly and who has knowledge of the destruction of those in high positions
 these are more sayings of the wise to have respect for a persons position when judging is not good
 he who says to the evil doer you are upright will be cursed by peoples and hated by nations
 but those who say sharp words to him will have delight and a blessing of good will come on them
 he gives a kiss with his lips who gives a right answer
 put your work in order outside and make it ready in the field and after that see to the building of your house
 do not be a violent witness against your neighbour or let your lips say what is false
 say not i will do to him as he has done to me i will give the man the reward of his work
 i went by the field of the hater of work and by the vine garden of the man without sense
 and it was all full of thorns and covered with waste plants and its stone wall was broken down
 then looking at it i gave thought i saw and i got teaching from it
 a little sleep a little rest a little folding of the hands in sleep
 so loss will come on you like an outlaw and your need like an armed man
 these are more wise sayings of solomon copied out by the men of hezekiah king of judah
 it is the glory of god to keep a thing secret but the glory of kings is to have it searched out
 the heaven is high and the earth is deep and the hearts of kings may not be searched out
 take away the waste from silver and a vessel will come out for the silver worker
 take away evil doers from before the king and the seat of his power will be made strong in righteousness
 do not take glory for yourself before the king and do not put yourself in the place of the great
 for it is better to have it said to you come up here than for you to be put down in a lower place before the ruler
 do not be quick to go to law about what you have seen for what will you do in the end when your neighbour has put you to shame
 have a talk with your neighbour himself about your cause but do not give away the secret of another
 or your hearer may say evil of you and your shame will not be turned away
 a word at the right time is like apples of gold in a network of silver
 like a nose ring of gold and an ornament of the best gold is a wise man who says sharp words to an ear ready to give attention
 as the cold of snow in the time of grain cutting so is a true servant to those who send him for he gives new life to the soul of his master
