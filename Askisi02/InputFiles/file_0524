 and aaron took as his wife elisheba the daughter of amminadab the sister of nahshon and she gave birth to nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
 and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korahites
 and eleazar aarons son took as his wife one of the daughters of putiel and she gave birth to phinehas these are the heads of the families of the levites in the order of their families
 these are the same aaron and moses to whom the lord said take the children of israel out of the land of egypt in their armies
 these are the men who gave orders to pharaoh to let the children of israel go out of egypt these are the same moses and aaron
 and on the day when the word of the lord came to moses in the land of egypt
 the lord said to moses i am the lord say to pharaoh king of egypt everything i am saying to you
 and moses said to the lord my lips are unclean how is it possible that pharaoh will give me a hearing
 and the lord said to moses see i have made you a god to pharaoh and aaron your brother will be your prophet
 say whatever i give you orders to say and aaron your brother will give word to pharaoh to let the children of israel go out of his land
 and i will make pharaohs heart hard and my signs and wonders will be increased in the land of egypt
 but pharaoh will not give ear to you and i will put my hand on egypt and take my armies my people the children of israel out of egypt after great punishments
 and the egyptians will see that i am the lord when my hand is stretched out over egypt and i take the children of israel out from among them
 and moses and aaron did so as the lord gave them orders so they did
 and moses was eighty years old and aaron eighty three years old when they gave the lords word to pharaoh
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 if pharaoh says to you let me see a wonder then say to aaron take your rod and put it down on the earth before pharaoh so that it may become a snake
 then moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and they did as the lord had said and aaron put his rod down on the earth before pharaoh and his servants and it became a snake
 then pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonder workers and they the wonder workers of egypt did the same with their secret arts
 for every one of them put down his rod on the earth and they became snakes but aarons rod made a meal of their rods
 but pharaohs heart was made hard and he did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses and aaron pharaohs heart is unchanged he will not let the people go
 go to pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water you will be waiting for him by the edge of the nile with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand
 and say to him the lord the god of the hebrews has sent me to you saying let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land but up to now you have not given ear to his words
 so the lord says by this you may be certain that i am the lord see by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the nile will be turned to blood
 and the fish in the nile will come to destruction and the river will send up a bad smell and the egyptians will not be able for disgust to make use of the water of the nile for drinking
 and the lord said say to aaron let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of egypt and over the rivers and the streams and the pools and over every stretch of water so that they may be turned to blood and there will be blood through all the land of egypt in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
 and moses and aaron did as the lord had said and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the nile before the eyes of pharaoh and his servants all the water in the nile was turned to blood
 and the fish in the nile came to destruction and a bad smell went up from the river and the egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the nile for drinking and there was blood through all the land of egypt
 and the wonder workers of egypt did the same with their secret arts but pharaohs heart was made hard and he would not give ear to them as the lord had said
