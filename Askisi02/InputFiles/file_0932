 for three things the earth is moved and there are four which it will not put up with
 a servant when he becomes a king a man without sense when his wealth is increased
 a hated woman when she is married and a servant girl who takes the place of her masters wife
 there are four things which are little on the earth but they are very wise
 the ants are a people not strong but they put by a store of food in the summer
 the conies are only a feeble people but they make their houses in the rocks
 the locusts have no king but they all go out in bands
 you may take the lizard in your hands but it is in kings houses
 there are three things whose steps are good to see even four whose goings are fair
 the lion which is strongest among beasts not turning from his way for any
 the war horse and the he goat and the king when his army is with him
 if you have done foolishly in lifting yourself up or if you have had evil designs put your hand over your mouth
 the shaking of milk makes butter and the twisting of the nose makes blood come so the forcing of wrath is a cause of fighting
 the words of lemuel king of massa the teaching which he had from his mother
 what am i to say to you o lemuel my oldest son and what o son of my body and what o son of my oaths
 do not give your strength to women or your ways to that which is the destruction of kings
 it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to take wine or for rulers to say where is strong drink
 for fear that through drinking they may come to have no respect for the law wrongly judging the cause of those who are in trouble
 give strong drink to him who is near to destruction and wine to him whose soul is bitter
 let him have drink and his need will go from his mind and the memory of his trouble will be gone
 let your mouth be open for those who have no voice in the cause of those who are ready for death
 let your mouth be open judging rightly and give right decisions in the cause of the poor and those in need
 who may make discovery of a woman of virtue for her price is much higher than jewels
 the heart of her husband has faith in her and he will have profit in full measure
 she does him good and not evil all the days of her life
 she gets wool and linen working at the business of her hands
 she is like the trading ships getting food from far away
 she gets up while it is still night and gives meat to her family and their food to her servant girls
 after looking at a field with care she gets it for a price planting a vine garden with the profit of her work
 she puts a band of strength round her and makes her arms strong
