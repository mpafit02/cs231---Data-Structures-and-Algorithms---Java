 you were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations you were completely beautiful because of my glory which i had put on you says the lord
 but you put your faith in the fact that you were beautiful acting like a loose woman because you were widely talked of and offering your cheap love to everyone who went by whoever it might be
 and you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour acting like a loose woman on them without shame or fear
 and you took the fair jewels my silver and gold which i had given to you and made for yourself male images acting like a loose woman with them
 and you took your robes of needlework for their clothing and put my oil and my perfume before them
 and my bread which i gave you the best meal and oil and honey which i gave you for your food you put it before them for a sweet smell says the lord
 and you took your sons and your daughters whom i had by you offering even these to them to be their food was your loose behaviour so small a thing
 that you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them
 and in all your disgusting and false behaviour you had no memory of your early days when you were uncovered and without clothing stretched out in your blood
 and it came about after all your evil doing says the lord
 that you made for yourself an arched room in every open place
 you put up your high places at the top of every street and made the grace of your form a disgusting thing opening your feet to everyone who went by increasing your loose ways
 and you went with the egyptians your neighbours great of flesh increasing your loose ways moving me to wrath
 now then my hand is stretched out against you cutting down your fixed amount and i have given you up to the desire of your haters the daughters of the philistines who are shamed by your loose ways
 and you went with the assyrians because of your desire which was without measure you were acting like a loose woman with them and still you had not enough
 and you went on in your loose ways even as far as the land of chaldaea and still you had not enough
 how feeble is your heart says the lord seeing that you do all these things the work of a loose and overruling woman
 for you have made your arched room at the top of every street and your high place in every open place though you were not like a loose woman in getting together your payment
 the untrue wife who takes strange lovers in place of her husband 
 they give payment to all loose women but you give rewards to your lovers offering them payment so that they may come to you on every side for your cheap love
 and in your loose behaviour you are different from other women for no one goes after you to make love to you and because you give payment and no payment is given to you in this you are different from them
 for this cause o loose woman give ear to the voice of the lord
 this is what the lord has said because your unclean behaviour was let loose and your body uncovered in your loose ways with your lovers and with your disgusting images and for the blood of your children which you gave to them
 for this cause i will get together all your lovers with whom you have taken your pleasure and all those to whom you have given your love with all those who were hated by you i will even make them come together against you on every side and i will have you uncovered before them so that they may see your shame
 and you will be judged by me as women are judged who have been untrue to their husbands and have taken life and i will let loose against you passion and bitter feeling
 i will give you into their hands and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels and when they have done you will be uncovered and shamed
 and they will get together a meeting against you stoning you with stones and wounding you with their swords
 and they will have you burned with fire sending punishments on you before the eyes of great numbers of women and i will put an end to your loose ways and you will no longer give payment
 and the heat of my wrath against you will have an end and my bitter feeling will be turned away from you and i will be quiet and will be angry no longer
 because you have not kept in mind the days when you were young but have been troubling me with all these things for this reason i will make the punishment of your ways come on your head says the lord because you have done this evil thing in addition to all your disgusting acts
