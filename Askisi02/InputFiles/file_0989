 for this cause we will have no fear even though the earth is changed and though the mountains are moved in the heart of the sea
 though its waters are sounding and troubled and though the mountains are shaking with their violent motion  selah 
 there is a river whose streams make glad the resting place of god the holy place of the tents of the most high
 god has taken his place in her she will not be moved he will come to her help at the dawn of morning
 the nations were angry the kingdoms were moved at the sound of his voice the earth became like wax
 the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our high tower  selah 
 come see the works of the lord the destruction which he has made in the earth
 he puts an end to wars over all the earth by him the bow is broken and the spear cut in two and the carriage burned in the fire
 be at peace in the knowledge that i am god i will be lifted up among the nations i will be honoured through all the earth
 the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our high tower  selah 
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of the sons of korah&gt o make a glad noise with your hands all you peoples letting your voices go up to god with joy
 for the lord most high is to be feared he is a great king over all the earth
 he will put down the peoples under us and the nations under our feet
 he will give us our heritage the glory of jacob who is dear to him  selah 
 god has gone up with a glad cry the lord with the sound of the horn
 give praises to god make songs of praise give praises to our king make songs of praise
 for god is the king of all the earth make songs of praise with knowledge
 god is the ruler over the nations god is on the high seat of his holy rule
 the rulers of the peoples have come together with the people of the god of abraham because the powers of the earth are gods he is lifted up on high
 &lta song a psalm of the sons of korah&gt great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the town of our god in his holy mountain
 beautiful in its high position the joy of all the earth is the mountain of zion the mountain of god the town of the great king
 in its buildings god is seen to be a high tower
 for see  the kings came together by agreement they were joined together
 they saw it and so were full of wonder they were troubled and went quickly away in fear
 shaking came on them and pain as on a woman in childbirth
 by you the ships of tarshish are broken as by an east wind
 as it came to our ears so have we seen it in the town of the lord of armies in the town of our god god will keep it fixed for ever  selah 
 our thoughts were of your mercy o god while we were in your temple
 as your name is o god so is your praise to the ends of the earth your right hand is full of righteousness
 let there be joy in the mountain of zion and let the daughters of judah be glad because of your wise decisions
