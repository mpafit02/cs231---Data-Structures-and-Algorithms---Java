 but they have been walking in the pride of their hearts going after the baals as their fathers gave them teaching
 so the lord of armies the god of israel has said i will give them even this people bitter plants for food and bitter water for drink
 and i will send them wandering among the nations among people strange to them and to their fathers and i will send the sword after them till i have put an end to them
 this is what the lord of armies has said take thought and send for the weeping women so that they may come and send for the wise women so that they may come
 let them quickly make cries of sorrow for us so that drops may be flowing from our eyes till they are streaming with water
 for a sound of weeping goes up from zion a cry how has destruction come on us we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land he has sent us out from our house
 but even now give ear to the word of the lord o you women let your ears be open to the word of his mouth training your daughters to give cries of sorrow everyone teaching her neighbour a song of grief
 for death has come up into our windows forcing its way into our great houses cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places
 the bodies of men will be falling like waste on the open fields and like grain dropped by the grain cutter and no one will take them up
 this is the word of the lord let not the wise man take pride in his wisdom or the strong man in his strength or the man of wealth in his wealth
 but if any man has pride let it be in this that he has the wisdom to have knowledge of me that i am the lord working mercy giving true decisions and doing righteousness in the earth for in these things i have delight says the lord
 see the day is coming says the lord when i will send punishment on all those who have circumcision in the flesh
 on egypt and on judah and on edom and on the children of ammon and on moab and on all who have the ends of their hair cut who are living in the waste land for all these nations and all the people of israel are without circumcision in their hearts
 there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job he was without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil
 and he had seven sons and three daughters
 and of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and a thousand oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great number of servants and the man was greater than any of the sons of the east
 his sons regularly went to one anothers houses and every one on his day gave a feast and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them
 and at the end of their days of feasting job sent and made them clean getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all for job said it may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of god in their hearts and job did this whenever the feasts came round
 and there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the lord and the satan came with them
 and the lord said to the satan where do you come from and the satan said in answer from wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
 and the lord said to the satan have you taken note of my servant job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil
 and the satan said in answer to the lord is it for nothing that job is a god fearing man
 have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side blessing the work of his hands and increasing his cattle in the land
 but now put out your hand against all he has and he will be cursing you to your face
 and the lord said to the satan see i give all he has into your hands only do not put a finger on the man himself and the satan went out from before the lord
 and there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother
 and a man came to job and said the oxen were ploughing and the asses were taking their food by their side
 and the men of sheba came against them and took them away putting the young men to the sword and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 and this one was still talking when another came and said the fire of god came down from heaven burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 and this one was still talking when another came and said the chaldaeans made themselves into three bands and came down on the camels and took them away putting the young men to the sword and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
