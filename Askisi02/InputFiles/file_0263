 for it is god who is the cause of your desires and of your acts for his good pleasure
 do all things without protests and arguments
 so that you may be holy and gentle children of god without sin in a twisted and foolish generation among whom you are seen as lights in the world
 offering the word of life so that i may have glory in you in the day of christ because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect
 and even if i am offered like a drink offering giving myself for the cause and work of your faith i am glad and have joy with you all
 and in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy
 but i am hoping in the lord jesus to send timothy to you before long so that i may be comforted when i have news of you
 for i have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you
 for they all go after what is theirs not after the things of christ
 but his quality is clear to you how as a child is to its father so he was a help to me in the work of the good news
 him then i am hoping to send as quickly as possible when i am able to see how things will go for me
 but i have faith in the lord that i myself will come before long
 but it seemed to me necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight and your servant sent by you for help in my need
 because his heart was with you all and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill
 for in fact he was ill almost to death but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me so that i might not have grief on grief
 i have sent him then the more gladly so that when you see him again you may be happy and i may have the less sorrow
 so take him to your hearts in the lord with all joy and give honour to such as he is
 because for the work of christ he was near to death putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete
 for the rest my brothers be glad in the lord writing the same things to you is no trouble to me and for you it is safe
 be on the watch against dogs against the workers of evil against those of the circumcision
 for we are the circumcision who give worship to god and have glory in jesus christ and have no faith in the flesh
 even though i myself might have faith in the flesh if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh i have more
 being given circumcision on the eighth day of the nation of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews in relation to the law a pharisee
 in bitter hate i was cruel to the church i kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail
 but those things which were profit to me i gave up for christ
 yes truly and i am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of christ jesus my lord which is more than all for whom i have undergone the loss of all things and to me they are less than nothing so that i may have christ as my reward
 and be seen in him not having my righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
 that i may have knowledge of him and of the power of his coming back from the dead and a part with him in his pains becoming like him in his death
 if in any way i may have the reward of life from the dead
 not as if i had even now got the reward or been made complete but i go on in the hope that i may come to the knowledge of that for which i was made the servant of christ jesus
