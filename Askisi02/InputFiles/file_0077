 but saul went on increasing in power and the jews in damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that jesus was the christ
 then after some days the jews made an agreement together to put him to death
 but saul got knowledge of their design and they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town so that they might put him to death
 but his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket
 and when he came to jerusalem he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples but they were all in fear of him not taking him for a disciple
 but barnabas took him to the apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the lord on the road and had given hearing to his words and how at damascus he had been preaching in the name of jesus without fear
 and he was with them going in and out at jerusalem
 preaching in the name of the lord without fear and he had discussions with the greek jews but they were working for his death
 and when the brothers had knowledge of it they took him to caesarea and sent him to tarsus
 and so the church through all judaea and galilee and samaria had peace and was made strong and living in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit was increased greatly
 and it came about that while peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at lydda
 and there was a certain man there named aeneas who for eight years had been in bed without power of moving
 and peter said to him aeneas jesus christ makes you well get up and make your bed and straight away he got up
 and all those living in lydda and sharon saw him and were turned to the lord
 now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha that is dorcas this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times
 and it came about in those days that she got ill and came to her death and when she had been washed they put her in a room which was high up
 and because lydda was near joppa the disciples having knowledge that peter was there sent two men to him requesting him to come to them straight away
 and peter went with them and when he had come they took him into the room and all the widows were there weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which dorcas had made while she was with them
 but peter made them all go outside and went down on his knees in prayer and turning to the body he said tabitha get up and opening her eyes she saw peter and got up
 and he took her hand lifting her up and sending for the saints and widows he gave her to them living
 and news of it went all through joppa and a number of people had faith in the lord
 and he was living in joppa for some time with simon a leather worker
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and timothy our brother
