 for you yourselves are used to taking us as your example because our life among you was ruled by order
 and we did not take food from any man for nothing but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you
 not because we have not the right but to make ourselves an example to you so that you might do the same
 for even when we were with you we gave you orders saying if any man does no work let him not have food
 for it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled who do no work at all but are over interested in the business of others
 now to such we give orders and make request in the lord jesus that working quietly they get their living
 and you my brothers do not get tired of well doing
 and if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter take note of that man and keep away from him so that he may be shamed
 have no feeling of hate for him but take him in hand seriously as a brother
 now the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way may the lord be with you all
 these words of love to you at the end are in my writing pauls writing and this is the mark of every letter from me
 may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god in the hope of the life which is in christ jesus
 to timothy my well loved child grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
 i give praise to god whose servant i have been with a heart free from sin from the time of my fathers because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me night and day
 desiring to see you keeping in my memory your weeping so that i may be full of joy
 having in mind your true faith which first was in your mothers mother lois and in your mother eunice and i am certain is now in you
 for this reason i say to you let that grace of god which is in you given to you by my hands have living power
 for god did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of self control
 have no feeling of shame then for the witness of our lord or for me his prisoner but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of god
 who gave us salvation marking us out for his purpose not on account of our works but in the measure of his purpose and his grace which was given to us in christ jesus before times eternal
 but has now been made clear by the revelation of our saviour christ jesus who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news
 of which i was made a preacher and an apostle and a teacher
 and for which i undergo these things but i have no feeling of shame for i have knowledge of him in whom i have faith and i am certain that he is able to keep that which i have given into his care till that day
 keep the form of those true words which you had from me in faith and love which is in christ jesus
 that good thing which was given to you keep safe through the holy spirit which is in us
 you have had news that all those in asia went away from me among whom are phygelus and hermogenes
 may the lord give mercy to the house of onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help and had no feeling of shame because i was in chains
 but when he was in rome he went in search of me everywhere and came to me
  may he have the lords mercy in that day  and of all he did for me at ephesus you have full knowledge
