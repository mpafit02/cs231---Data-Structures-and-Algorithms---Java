 and a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs was taken there every day and put down at the door of the temple which is named beautiful requesting money from those who went into the temple
 he then seeing peter and john going into the temple made a request to them
 and peter looking at him with john said keep your eyes on us
 and he gave attention to them hoping to get something from them
 but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have that i give to you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth get up on your feet
 and he took him by his right hand lifting him up and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong
 and jumping up he got on to his feet and went into the temple with them walking and jumping and giving praise to god
 and all the people saw him walking and praising god
 and they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the temple and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place
 and while he kept his hands on peter and john all the people came running together to the covered way which is named solomons full of wonder
 and when peter saw it he said to the people you men of israel why are you so greatly surprised at this man or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs
 the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers has given glory to his servant jesus whom you gave up turning your backs on him when pilate had made the decision to let him go free
 but you would have nothing to do with the holy and upright one and made request for a man of blood to be given to you
 and put to death the lord of life whom god gave back from the dead of which fact we are witnesses
 and his name through faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and have knowledge of yes the faith which is through him has made him well before you all
 and now my brothers i am conscious that you did this as did your rulers without knowledge
 but the things which god had made clear before by the mouth of all the prophets that the christ would have to undergo he has put into effect in this way
 so then let your hearts be changed and be turned to god so that your sins may be completely taken away and times of blessing may come from the lord
 and that he may send the christ who was marked out for you from the first even jesus
 who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right of which god has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from the earliest times
 for moses said the lord will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to everything which he will say to you
 and every soul who does not give attention to that prophet will be cut off from among the people
 and all the prophets from samuel and those who came after every one of them gave word of these days
 you are the sons of the prophets and of the agreement which god made with your fathers saying to abraham through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth
 to you first god sent his servant blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins
 and while they were talking to the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came up to them
 being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead
 and they took them and put them in prison till the morning for it was now evening
 but a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith and they were now about five thousand
 and on the day after the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in jerusalem
