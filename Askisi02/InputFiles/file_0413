 now barzillai was a very old man as much as eighty years old and he had given the king everything he had need of while he was at mahanaim for he was a very great man
 and the king said to barzillai come over with me and i will take care of you in jerusalem
 and barzillai said to the king how much of my life is still before me for me to go up to jerusalem with the king
 i am now eighty years old good and bad are the same to me have meat and drink any taste for me now am i able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song why then am i to be a trouble to my lord the king
 your servants desire was only to take the king over jordan why is the king to give me such a reward
 let your servant now go back again so that when death comes to me it may be in my town and by the resting place of my father and mother but here is your servant chimham let him go with my lord the king and do for him what seems good to you
 and the king said in answer let chimham go over with me and i will do for him whatever seems good to you and whatever your desire is i will do it for you
 then all the people went over jordan and the king went over and the king gave barzillai a kiss with his blessing and he went back to his place
 so the king went over to gilgal and chimham went with him and all the people of judah as well as half the people of israel took the king on his way
 then the men of israel came to the king and said why have our countrymen of judah taken you away in secret and come over jordan with the king and all his family because all his people are davids men
 and all the men of judah gave this answer to the men of israel because the king is our near relation why then are you angry about this have we taken any of the kings food or has he given us any offering
 and in answer to the men of judah the men of israel said we have ten parts in the king and we are the first in order of birth why did you make nothing of us and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back and the words of the men of judah were more violent than the words of the men of israel
 now after this david questioning the lord said am i to go up into any of the towns of judah and the lord said to him go up and david said where am i to go and he said to hebron
 so david went there taking with him his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail the wife of nabal of carmel
 and david took all his men with him every man with his family and they were living in the towns round hebron
 and the men of judah came there and with the holy oil made david king over the people of judah and word came to david that it was the men of jabesh gilead who put sauls body in its last resting place
 and david sent to the men of jabesh gilead and said to them may the lord give you his blessing because you have done this kind act to saul your lord and have put his body to rest 
 may the lord be good and true to you and i myself will see that your kind act is rewarded because you have done this thing
 then let your hands be strong and have no fear though saul your lord is dead the people of judah have made me their king
 now abner the son of ner captain of sauls army had taken sauls son ish bosheth over to mahanaim
 and made him king over gilead and the asherites and over jezreel and ephraim and benjamin that is over all israel
  sauls son ish bosheth was forty years old when he became king over israel and he was ruler for two years  but judah was on the side of david
 and the time when david was king in hebron over the people of judah was seven years and six months
 and abner the son of ner with the servants of sauls son ish bosheth went out from mahanaim to gibeon
 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and came face to face with them by the pool of gibeon and they took up their position facing one another on opposite sides of the pool
 and abner said to joab let the young men give a test of their strength before us and joab said let them do so
 so they got up and went over by number twelve for benjamin and ish bosheth and twelve of the servants of david
 and every one got the other by the head driving his sword into the others side so they all went down together and that place was named the field of sides and it is in gibeon
 and there was hard fighting that day and abner and the men of israel gave way before the servants of david
 there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as quick footed as a roe of the fields
