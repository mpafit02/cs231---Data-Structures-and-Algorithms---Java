 and god said to solomon because this was in your heart and you did not make request for money property or honour or for the destruction of your haters or for long life but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself so that you may be the judge of my people over whom i have made you king
 wisdom and knowledge are given to you and i will give you wealth and honour such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you
 so solomon went back from the high place at gibeon from before the tent of meeting to jerusalem and he was king over israel
 and solomon got together war carriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen which he kept some in the carriage towns and some with the king at jerusalem
 and the king made silver and gold as common as stones in jerusalem and cedar like the sycamore trees of the lowland in number
 and solomons horses came out of egypt the kings traders got them from kue at a price
 a war carriage might be got from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of aram
 and rehoboam went to shechem where all israel had come together to make him king
 and when jeroboam the son of nebat had news of it  for he was in egypt where he had gone in flight from king solomon  he came back from egypt
 and they sent for him and jeroboam and all israel came to rehoboam and said
 your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
 and he said to them come to me again after three days so the people went away
 then king rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with solomon his father when he was living and said in your opinion what answer am i to give to this people
 and they said to him if you are kind to this people pleasing them and saying good words to them then they will be your servants for ever
 but he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
 and he said to them what is your opinion what answer are we to give to this people who have said to me make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
 and the young men of his generation said to him this is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying your father put a hard yoke on us but will you make it less say to them my little finger is thicker than my fathers body
 if my father put a hard yoke on you i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give you blows with snakes
 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying come to me again on the third day
 and the king gave them a rough answer so king rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men
 but gave them the answer put forward by the young men saying my father made your yoke hard but i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give it with snakes
 so the king did not give ear to the people for this came about by the purpose of god so that the lord might give effect to his word which he had said by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat
 and when all israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king what part have we in david what is our heritage in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel now see to your house david so all israel went to their tents
 but rehoboam was still king over those of the children of israel who were living in the towns of judah
 then rehoboam sent adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all israel and king rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to jerusalem
 so israel was turned away from the family of david to this day
 and rehoboam came to jerusalem and got together the men of judah and benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting men to make war against israel and get the kingdom back for rehoboam
 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying
 say to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin
 the lord has said you are not to go to war against your brothers let every man go back to his house for this thing is my purpose so they gave ear to the words of the lord and were turned back from fighting against jeroboam
