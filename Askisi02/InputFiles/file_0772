 these are the heritages of which moses made distribution in the lowlands of moab on the other side of jordan in jericho to the east
 but to the tribe of levi moses gave no heritage the lord the god of israel is their heritage as he said to them
 and these are the heritages which the children of israel took in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the tribes of the children of israel gave out to them
 their heritage by the lords decision as he gave orders by moses for the nine tribes and the half tribe
 for moses had given their heritage to the two tribes and the half tribe on the other side of jordan but to the levites he gave no heritage among them
 because the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim and they gave the levites no part in the land only towns for their living places with the grass lands for their cattle and for their property
 as the lord had given orders to moses so the people of israel did and they made division of the land
