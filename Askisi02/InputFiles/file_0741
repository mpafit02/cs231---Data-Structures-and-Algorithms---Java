 for he has knowledge of the way i take after i have been tested i will come out like gold
 my feet have gone in his steps i have kept in his way without turning to one side or to the other
 i have never gone against the orders of his lips the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart
 but his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it and he gives effect to the desire of his soul
 for what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end and his mind is full of such designs
 for this cause i am in fear before him my thoughts of him overcome me
 for god has made my heart feeble and my mind is troubled before the ruler of all
 for i am overcome by the dark and by the black night which is covering my face
 why are times not stored up by the ruler of all and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days
 the landmarks are changed by evil men they violently take away flocks together with their keepers
 they send away the ass of him who has no father they take the widows ox for debt
 the crushed are turned out of the way all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together
 like asses in the waste land they go out to their work looking for food with care from the waste land they get bread for their children
 they get mixed grain from the field and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth
 they take their rest at night without clothing and have no cover in the cold
 they are wet with the rain of the mountains and get into the cracks of the rock for cover
 the child without a father is forced from its mothers breast and they take the young children of the poor for debt
 others go about without clothing and though they have no food they get in the grain from the fields
 between the lines of olive trees they make oil though they have no drink they are crushing out the grapes
 from the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help but god does not take note of their prayer
 then there are those who are haters of the light who have no knowledge of its ways and do not go in them
 he who is purposing death gets up before day so that he may put to death the poor and those in need
 and the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening saying no eye will see me and he puts a cover on his face and in the night the thief goes about
 in the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses in the daytime they are shutting themselves up they have no knowledge of the light
 for the middle of the night is as morning to them they are not troubled by the fear of the dark
 they go quickly on the face of the waters their heritage is cursed in the earth the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine garden
 snow waters become dry with the heat so do sinners go down into the underworld
 the public place of his town has no more knowledge of him and his name has gone from the memory of men he is rooted up like a dead tree
 he is not kind to the widow and he has no pity for her child
 but god by his power gives long life to the strong he gets up again though he has no hope of life
