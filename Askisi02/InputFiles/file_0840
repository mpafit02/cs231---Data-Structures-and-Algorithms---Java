 if anyone is untrue sinning in error in connection with the holy things of the lord let him take his offering to the lord a male sheep from the flock without any mark of the value fixed by you in silver by shekels by the scale of the holy place
 and he is to make payment to the priest for what he has done wrong in relation to the holy thing together with a fifth part of its value in addition and the priest will take away his sin by the sheep of his offering and he will have forgiveness
 and if anyone does wrong and does any of the things which the lord has given orders are not to be done though he has no knowledge of it still he is in the wrong and he is responsible
 let him come to the priest with a sheep a male without any mark out of the flock of the value fixed by you as an offering for his error and the priest will take away the sin which he did in error and he will have forgiveness
 it is an offering for his error he is certainly responsible before the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 if anyone does wrong and is untrue to the lord acting falsely to his neighbour in connection with something put in his care or something given for a debt or has taken away anything by force or has been cruel to his neighbour
 or has taken a false oath about the loss of something which he has come across by chance if a man has done any of these evil things
 causing sin to come on him then he will have to give back the thing he took by force or got by cruel acts or the goods which were put in his care or the thing he came on by chance
 or anything about which he took a false oath he will have to give it all back with the addition of a fifth of its value to him whose property it is when he has been judged to be in the wrong
 then let him take to the lord the offering for his wrongdoing giving to the priest for his offering a male sheep from the flock without any mark of the value fixed by you
 and the priest will take away his sin from before the lord and he will have forgiveness for whatever crime he has done
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to aaron and to his sons saying this is the law for the burned offering the offering is to be on the fire wood on the altar all night till the morning and the fire of the altar is to be kept burning
 and the priest is to put on his linen robes and his linen trousers and take up what is over of the offering after it has been burned on the altar and put it by the side of the altar
 then having taken off his linen robes and put on other clothing he is to take it away into a clean place outside the tent circle
 the fire on the altar is to be kept burning it is never to go out every morning the priest is to put wood on it placing the burned offering in order on it and there the fat of the peace offering is to be burned
 let the fire be kept burning on the altar at all times it is never to go out
 and this is the law for the meal offering it is to be offered to the lord before the altar by the sons of aaron
 the priest is to take in his hand some of the meal of the meal offering and of the oil of it and all the perfume on it burning it on the altar as a sign for a sweet smell to the lord
 and whatever is over aaron and his sons may have for their food taking it without leaven in a holy place in the open space of the tent of meeting they may take a meal of it
 it is not to be cooked with leaven i have given it to them as their part of the offerings made by fire to me it is most holy as are the sin offerings and the offerings for error
 every male among the children of aaron may have it for food it is their right for ever through all your generations from the offerings made by fire to the lord anyone touching them will be holy
 and the lord said to moses
 this is the offering which aaron and his sons are to make to the lord on the day when he is made a priest the tenth part of an ephah of the best meal for a meal offering for ever half of it in the morning and half in the evening
 let it be made with oil on a flat plate when it is well mixed and cooked let it be broken and taken in as a meal offering for a sweet smell to the lord
 and the same offering is to be given by that one of his sons who takes his place as priest by an order for ever all of it is to be burned before the lord
 every meal offering offered for the priest is to be completely burned nothing of it is to be taken for food
 and the lord said to moses
