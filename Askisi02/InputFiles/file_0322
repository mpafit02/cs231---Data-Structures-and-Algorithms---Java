 give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
 if they do wrong against you  for no man is without sin  and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land far off or near
 and if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners and are turned again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying we are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
 and with all their heart and soul are turned again to you in the land of those who took them prisoners and make their prayer to you turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which i made for your name
 then give ear to their prayer and to their cry in heaven your living place and see right done to them
 answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you and overlooking the evil which they have done against you let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them and have pity on them
 for they are your people and your heritage which you took out of egypt out of the iron fireplace
 let your eyes be open to your servants prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people israel hearing them when their cry comes to you
 for you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage as you said by moses your servant when you took our fathers out of egypt o lord god
 then solomon after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the lord got up from his knees before the altar of the lord where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven
 and getting on his feet he gave a blessing to all the men of israel saying with a loud voice
 praise be to the lord who has given rest to his people israel as he gave them his word to do every word of all his oath which he gave by the hand of moses his servant has come true
 now may the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him never go away from us or give us up
 turning our hearts to himself guiding us to go in all his ways to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions which he gave to our fathers
 and may these my words the words of my prayer to the lord be before the lord our god day and night so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people israel day by day as we have need
 so that all the peoples of the earth may see that the lord is god and there is no other
 then let your hearts be without sin before the lord our god walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day
 now the king and all israel with him were making offerings before the lord
 and solomon gave to the lord for peace offerings twenty two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel kept the feast of the opening of the lords house
 the same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the lord offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings for there was not room on the brass altar of the lord for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peace offerings
 so solomon and all israel with him a very great meeting  for the people had come together from the way into hamath to the river of egypt  kept the feast at that time before the lord our god for two weeks even fourteen days
 and on the eighth day he sent the people away and blessing the king they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the lord had done to david his servant and to israel his people
 now when solomon came to the end of building the house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desires which he had in mind were effected
 the lord came to him again in a vision as he had done at gibeon
 and the lord said to him your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears i have made holy this house which you have made and i have put my name there for ever my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
 as for you if you will go on your way before me as david your father did uprightly and with a true heart doing what i have given you orders to do keeping my laws and my decisions
 then i will make the seat of your rule over israel certain for ever as i gave my word to david your father saying you will never be without a man to be king in israel
 but if you are turned from my ways you or your children and do not keep my orders and my laws which i have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship
 then i will have israel cut off from the land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for myself i will put away from before my eyes and israel will be a public example and a word of shame among all peoples
 and this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds and they will say why has the lord done so to this land and to this house
