 and having said these words he went down on his knees in prayer with them all
 and they were all weeping falling on pauls neck and kissing him
 being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again and so they went with him to the ship
 and after parting from them we put out to sea and came straight to cos and the day after to rhodes and from there to patara
 and as there was a ship going to phoenicia we went in it
 and when we had come in view of cyprus going past it on our left we went on to syria and came to land at tyre for there the goods which were in the ship had to be taken out
 and meeting the disciples we were there for seven days and they gave paul orders through the spirit not to go up to jerusalem
 and when these days came to an end we went on our journey and they all with their wives and children came with us on our way till we were out of the town and after going on our knees in prayer by the sea
 we said our last words to one another and got into the ship and they went back to their houses
 and journeying by ship from tyre we came to ptolemais and there we had talk with the brothers and were with them for one day
 and on the day after we went away and came to caesarea where we were guests in the house of philip the preacher who was one of the seven
 and he had four daughters virgins who were prophets
 and while we were waiting there for some days a certain prophet named agabus came down from judaea
 and he came to us and took the band of pauls clothing and putting it round his feet and hands said the holy spirit says these words so will the jews do to the man who is the owner of this band and they will give him up into the hands of the gentiles
 and hearing these things we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to jerusalem
 then paul said what are you doing weeping and wounding my heart for i am ready not only to be a prisoner but to be put to death at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
 and as he might not be moved we did no more saying let the purpose of god be done
 and after these days we got ready and went up to jerusalem
 and some of the disciples from caesarea went with us taking a certain mnason of cyprus one of the early disciples in whose house we were to be living
 and when we came to jerusalem the brothers were pleased to see us
 and on the day after paul went with us to james and all the rulers of the church were present
 and when he had said how glad he was to see them he gave them a detailed account of the things which god had done through his work among the gentiles
 and hearing it they gave praise to god and they said to him you see brother what thousands there are among the jews who have the faith and they all have a great respect for the law
 and they have had news of you how you have been teaching all the jews among the gentiles to give up the law of moses and not to give circumcision to their children and not to keep the old rules
 what then is the position they will certainly get news that you have come
 do this then which we say to you we have four men who have taken an oath
 go with these and make yourself clean with them and make the necessary payments for them so that they may be free from their oath and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true but that you put yourself under rule and keep the law
 but as to the gentiles who have the faith we sent a letter giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods and from blood and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from the evil desires of the body
 then paul took the men and on the day after making himself clean with them he went into the temple giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete till the offering was made for every one of them
 and when the seven days were almost ended the jews from asia seeing him in the temple got the people together and put their hands on him
