 and david said to his men before the lord never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord the man of the lords selection for the lords holy oil has been put on him
 so with these words david kept his servants back and did not let them make an attack on saul and saul got up and went on his way
 and after that david came out of the hollow rock and crying after saul said my lord the king and when saul gave a look back david went down on his face and gave him honour
 and david said to saul why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong
 look  you have seen today how the lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks and some would have had me put you to death but i had pity on you for i said never will my hand be lifted up against my lord who has been marked with the holy oil
 and see my father see the skirt of your robe in my hand for the fact that i took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that i have no evil purpose and i have done you no wrong though you are waiting for my life to take it
 may the lord be judge between me and you and may the lord give me my rights against you but my hand will never be lifted up against you
 there is an old saying from the evil doer comes evil but my hand will never be lifted up against you
 after whom has the king of israel come out for whom are you searching for a dead dog an insect
 so let the lord be judge and give a decision between me and you and see and give support to my cause and keep me from falling into your hands
 now when david had said these words to saul saul said is this your voice david my son and saul was overcome with weeping
 and he said to david you are right and i am wrong for you have given me back good but i have given you evil
 and you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today because when the lord gave me up into your hands you did not put me to death
 if a man comes across his hater will he let him get away safe so may you be rewarded by the lord for what you have done for me today
 and now i am certain that you will be king and that the kingdom of israel will be made strong under your authority
 so give me your oath by the lord that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my fathers family
 and david gave saul his oath and saul went back to his house but david and his men went up to their safe place
 and death came to samuel and all israel came together weeping for him and put his body in its resting place in his house at ramah then david went down to the waste land of maon
 now there was a man in maon whose business was in carmel he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in carmel
 now this man was named nabal and his wifes name was abigail she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks but the man was cruel and evil in his ways he was of the family of caleb
 and david had word in the waste land that nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep
 and david sent ten young men and said to them go up to carmel and go to nabal and say kind words to him in my name
 and say this to my brother may all be well for you peace be to you and your house and all you have
 i have had word that you have wool cutters now the keepers of your sheep have been with us and we have done them no evil and taken nothing of theirs while they were in carmel
 if your young men are questioned they will say the same thing so now let my young men have grace in your eyes for we are come at a good time please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son david
 and when davids young men came they said all this to nabal in davids name and said nothing more
 and nabal gave them his answer and said who is david who is the son of jesse there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters
 am i to take my bread and my wine and the meat i have got ready for my wool cutters and give it to men coming from i have no idea where
 so davids young men turning away went back and gave him an account of everything he had said
 and david said to his men put on your swords every one of you and every man put on his sword and david did the same and about four hundred men went up with david and two hundred kept watch over their goods
