 and she will have no more fear of change being full of salvation wisdom and knowledge the fear of the lord is her wealth
 see the men of war are sorrowing outside the town those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly
 the highways are waste no man is journeying there the agreement is broken he has made sport of the towns he has no thought for man
 the earth is sorrowing and wasting away lebanon is put to shame and has become waste sharon is like the arabah and in bashan and carmel the leaves are falling
 now will i come forward says the lord now will i be lifted up now will my power be seen
 your designs will be without profit and their effect will be nothing you will be burned up by the fire of my breath
 and the peoples will be like the burning of chalk as thorns cut down which are burned in the fire
 give ear you who are far off to what i have done see my power you who are near
 the sinners in zion are full of fear the haters of god are shaking with wonder who among us may keep his place before the burning fire who among us may see the eternal burnings
 he whose ways are true and whose words are upright he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts whose hands have not taken rewards who will have no part in putting men to death and whose eyes are shut against evil
 he will have a place on high he will be safely shut in by the high rocks his bread will be given to him his waters will be certain
 your eyes will see the king in his glory they will be looking on a far stretching land
 your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear where is the scribe where is he who made a record of the payments where is he by whom the towers were numbered
 never again will you see the cruel people a people whose tongue has no sense for you whose language is strange to you
 let your eyes be resting on zion the town of our holy feasts you will see jerusalem a quiet resting place a tent which will not be moved whose tent pins will never be pulled up and whose cords will never be broken
 but there the lord will be with us in his glory  wide rivers and streams where no boat will go with blades and no fair ship will be sailing
 for the lord is our judge the lord is our law giver the lord is our king he will be our saviour
 your cords have become loose they were not able to make strong the support of their sails the sail was not stretched out then the blind will take much property the feeble footed will make division of the goods of war
 and the men of zion will not say i am ill for its people will have forgiveness for their sin
 come near you nations and give ear take note you peoples let the earth and everything in it give ear the world and all those living in it
 for the lord is angry with all the nations and his wrath is burning against all their armies he has put them to the curse he has given them to destruction
 their dead bodies will be thick on the face of the earth and their smell will come up and the mountains will be flowing with their blood and all the hills will come to nothing
 and the heavens will be rolled together like the roll of a book and all their army will be gone like a dead leaf from the vine or a dry fruit from the fig tree
 for my sword in heaven is full of wrath see it is coming down on edom in punishment on the people of my curse
 the sword of the lord is full of blood it is fat with the best of the meat with the blood of lambs and goats with the best parts of the sheep for the lord has a feast in bozrah and much cattle will be put to death in the land of edom
 and the strong oxen will go down to death together with the smaller cattle
 for it is the day of the lords punishment when he gives payment for the wrongs done to zion
 and its streams will be turned into boiling oil and its dust into burning stone and all the land will be on fire
 it will not be put out day or night its smoke will go up for ever it will be waste from generation to generation no one will go through it for ever
 but the birds of the waste land will have their place there it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land
