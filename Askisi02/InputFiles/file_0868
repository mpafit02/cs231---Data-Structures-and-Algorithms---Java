 sweet is the memory of the fish we had in egypt for nothing and the fruit and green plants of every sort sharp and pleasing to the taste
 but now our soul is wasted away there is nothing at all we have nothing but this manna before our eyes
 now the manna was like a seed of grain like small clear drops
 the people went about taking it up from the earth crushing it between stones or hammering it to powder and boiling it in pots and they made cakes of it its taste was like the taste of cakes cooked with oil
 when the dew came down on the tents at night the manna came down with it
 and at the sound of the people weeping every man at his tent door the wrath of the lord was great and moses was very angry
 and moses said to the lord why have you done me this evil and why have i not grace in your eyes that you have put on me the care of all this people
 am i the father of all this people have i given them birth that you say to me take them in your arms like a child at the breast to the land which you gave by an oath to their fathers
 where am i to get flesh to give to all this people for they are weeping to me and saying give us flesh for our food
 i am not able by myself to take the weight of all this people for it is more than my strength
 if this is to be my fate put me to death now in answer to my prayer if i have grace in your eyes and let me not see my shame
 and the lord said to moses send for seventy of the responsible men of israel who are in your opinion men of weight and authority over the people make them come to the tent of meeting and be there with you
 and i will come down and have talk with you there and i will take some of the spirit which is on you and put it on them and they will take part of the weight of the people off you so that you do not have to take it by yourself
 and say to the people make yourselves clean before tomorrow and you will have flesh for your food for in the ears of the lord you have been weeping and saying who will give us flesh for food for we were well off in egypt and so the lord will give you flesh and it will be your food
 not for one day only or even for five or ten or twenty days
 but every day for a month till you are tired of it turning from it in disgust because you have gone against the lord who is with you and have been weeping before him saying why did we come out of egypt
 then moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand men on foot and you have said i will give them flesh to be their food for a month
 are flocks and herds to be put to death for them or are all the fish in the sea to be got together so that they may be full
 and the lord said to moses has the lords hand become short now you will see if my word comes true for you or not
 and moses went out and gave the people the words of the lord and he took seventy of the responsible men of the people placing them round the tent
 then the lord came down in the cloud and had talk with him and put on the seventy men some of the spirit which was on him now when the spirit came to rest on them they were like prophets but only at that time
 but two men were still in the tent circle one of them named eldad and the other medad and the spirit came to rest on them they were among those who had been sent for but they had not gone out to the tent and the prophets power came on them in the tent circle
 and a young man went running to moses and said eldad and medad are acting as prophets in the tent circle
 then joshua the son of nun who had been moses servant from the time when he was a child said my lord moses let them be stopped
 and moses said to him are you moved by envy on my account if only all the lords people were prophets and the lord might put his spirit on them 
 then moses with the responsible men of israel went back to the tent circle
 then the lord sent a wind driving little birds from the sea so that they came down on the tents and all round the tent circle about a days journey on this side and on that in masses about two cubits high over the face of the earth
 and all that day and all night and the day after the people were taking up the birds the smallest amount which anyone got was ten homers and they put them out all round the tents
 but while the meat was still between their teeth before it was tasted the wrath of the lord was moved against the people and he sent a great outburst of disease on them
 so that place was named kibroth hattaavah because there they put in the earth the bodies of the people who had given way to their desires
