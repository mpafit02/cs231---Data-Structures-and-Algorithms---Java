 so that he might make it holy having made it clean with the washing of water by the word
 and might take it for himself a church full of glory not having one mark or fold or any such thing but that it might be holy and complete
 even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies he who has love for his wife has love for himself
 for no man ever had hate for his flesh but he gives it food and takes care of it even as christ does for the church
 because we are parts of his body
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
 this is a great secret but my words are about christ and the church
 but do you everyone have love for his wife even as for himself and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband
 children do what is ordered by your fathers and mothers in the lord for this is right
 give honour to your father and mother  which is the first rule having a reward 
 so that all may be well for you and your life may be long on the earth
 and you fathers do not make your children angry but give them training in the teaching and fear of the lord
 servants do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters having respect and fear for them with all your heart as to christ
 not only under your masters eye as pleasers of men but as servants of christ doing the pleasure of god from the heart
 doing your work readily as to the lord and not to men
 in the knowledge that for every good thing anyone does he will have his reward from the lord if he is a servant or if he is free
 and you masters do the same things to them not making use of violent words in the knowledge that their master and yours is in heaven and he has no respect for a mans position
 lastly be strong in the lord and in the strength of his power
 take up gods instruments of war so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the evil one
 for our fight is not against flesh and blood but against authorities and powers against the world rulers of this dark night against the spirits of evil in the heavens
 for this reason take up all the arms of god so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day and having done all to keep your place
 take your place then having your body clothed with the true word and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
 be ready with the good news of peace as shoes on your feet
 and most of all using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the evil one
 and take salvation for your head dress and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
 with prayers and deep desires making requests at all times in the spirit and keeping watch with strong purpose in prayer for all the saints
 and for me that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make clear without fear the secret of the good news
 for which i am a representative in chains and that i may say without fear the things which it is right for me to say
 but so that you may have knowledge of my business and how i am tychicus the well loved brother and tested servant in the lord will give you news of all things
 whom i have sent to you for this very purpose so that you may have knowledge of our position and that he may give comfort to your hearts
