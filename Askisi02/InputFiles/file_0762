 i have no desire for life i would not be living for ever  keep away from me for my days are as a breath
 what is man that you have made him great and that your attention is fixed on him
 and that your hand is on him every morning and that you are testing him every minute
 how long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me so that i may have a minutes breathing space
 if i have done wrong what have i done to you o keeper of men why have you made me a mark for your blows so that i am a weariness to myself
 and why do you not take away my sin and let my wrongdoing be ended for now i go down to the dust and you will be searching for me with care but i will be gone
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 how long will you say these things and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind
 does god give wrong decisions or is the ruler of all not upright in his judging
 if your children have done evil against him then their punishment is from his hand
 if you will make search for god with care and put your request before the ruler of all
 if you are clean and upright then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again
 and though your start was small your end will be very great
 put the question now to the past generations and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers
  for we are but of yesterday and have no knowledge because our days on earth are gone like a shade 
 will they not give you teaching and say words of wisdom to you
 will the river plant come up in its pride without wet earth will the grass get tall without water
 when it is still green without being cut down it becomes dry and dead before any other plant
 so is the end of all who do not keep god in mind and the hope of the evil doer comes to nothing
 whose support is cut off and whose hope is no stronger than a spiders thread
 he is looking to his family for support but it is not there he puts his hope in it but it comes to nothing
 he is full of strength before the sun and his branches go out over his garden
 his roots are twisted round the stones forcing their way in between them
 if he is taken away from his place then it will say i have not seen you
 such is the joy of his way and out of the dust another comes up to take his place
 truly god will not give up him who is without sin and will not take evil doers by the hand
 the time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing and cries of joy will come from your lips
 your haters will be clothed with shame and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again
 and job made answer and said
 truly i see that it is so and how is it possible for a man to get his right before god
