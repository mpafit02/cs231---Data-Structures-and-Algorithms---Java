 if we say we are joined to him and are walking still in the dark our words are false and our acts are untrue
 but if we are walking in the light as he is in the light we are all united with one another and the blood of jesus his son makes us clean from all sin
 if we say that we have no sin we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us
 if we say openly that we have done wrong he is upright and true to his word giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil
 if we say that we have no sin we make him false and his word is not in us
 my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin and if any man is a sinner we have a friend and helper with the father jesus christ the upright one
 he is the offering for our sins and not for ours only but for all the world
 and by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him if we keep his laws
 the man who says i have knowledge of him and does not keep his laws is false and there is nothing true in him
 but in every man who keeps his word the love of god is made complete by this we may be certain that we are in him
 he who says that he is living in him will do as he did
 my loved ones i do not give you a new law but an old law which you had from the first this old law is the word which came to your ears
 again i give you a new law which is true in him and in you for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out
 he who says that he is in the light and has hate in his heart for his brother is still in the dark
 he who has love for his brother is in the light and there is no cause of error in him
 but he who has hate for his brother is in the dark walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going unable to see because of the dark
 i am writing to you my children because you have forgiveness of sins through his name
 i am writing to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first i am writing to you young men because you have overcome the evil one i have sent a letter to you children because you have knowledge of the father
 i have sent a letter to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first i have sent a letter to you young men because you are strong and the word of god is in you and because you have overcome the evil one
 have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world if any man has love for the world the love of the father is not in him
 because everything in the world the desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world
 and the world and its desires is coming to an end but he who does gods pleasure is living for ever
 little children it is the last hour and as you were given word that the antichrist would come so now a number of antichrists have come to you and by this we are certain that it is the last hour
 they went out from us but they were not of us if they had been of us they would still be with us but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us
 and you have the spirit from the holy one and you all have knowledge
 i have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true but because you have knowledge and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true
 who is false but he who says that jesus is not the christ he is the antichrist who has no belief in the father or the son
 he who has no belief in the son has not the father he who makes clear his belief in the son has the father
 but as for you keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first if you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the father and the son
 and this is the hope which he gave you even eternal life
