 brothers it is clear to me that i have not come to that knowledge but one thing i do letting go those things which are past and stretching out to the things which are before
 i go forward to the mark even the reward of the high purpose of god in christ jesus
 then let us all who have come to full growth be of this mind and if in anything you are of a different mind even this will god make clear to you
 only as far as we have got let us be guided by the same rule
 brothers take me as your example and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given
 for there are those of whom i have given you word before and do so now with sorrow who are haters of the cross of christ
 whose end is destruction whose god is the stomach and whose glory is in their shame whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth
 for our country is in heaven from where the saviour for whom we are waiting will come even the lord jesus christ
 by whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself
 so my brothers well loved and very dear to me my joy and crown be strong in the lord my loved ones
 i make request to euodias and syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord
 and i make request to you true helper in my work to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news with clement and the rest of my brother workers whose names are in the book of life
 be glad in the lord at all times again i say be glad
 let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men the lord is near
 have no cares but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before god
 and the peace of god which is deeper than all knowledge will keep your hearts and minds in christ jesus
 for the rest my brothers whatever things are true whatever things have honour whatever things are upright whatever things are holy whatever things are beautiful whatever things are of value if there is any virtue and if there is any praise give thought to these things
 the things which came to you by my teaching and preaching and which you saw in me these things do and the god of peace will be with you
 but i am very glad in the lord that your care for me has come to life again though you did in fact take thought for me but you were not able to give effect to it
 but i will not say anything about my needs for i am able wherever i am to be dependent on myself
 it is the same to me if i am looked down on or honoured everywhere and in all things i have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food how to have wealth and how to be in need
 i am able to do all things through him who gives me strength
 but you did well to have care for me in my need
 and you have knowledge philippians that when the good news first came to you when i went away from macedonia no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints but you only
 because even in thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need
 not that i am looking for an offering but for fruit which may be put to your credit
 i have all things and more than enough i am made full having had from epaphroditus the things which came from you a perfume of a sweet smell an offering well pleasing to god
 and my god will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in christ jesus
 now to god our father be glory for ever and ever so be it
 give words of love to every saint in christ jesus the brothers who are with me send you their love
