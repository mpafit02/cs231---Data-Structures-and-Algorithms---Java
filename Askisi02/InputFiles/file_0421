 your hands were free your feet were not chained like the downfall of a man before evil men so was your fall and the weeping of the people over him went on again
 and the people came to make david take food while it was still day but david with an oath said may gods punishment be on me if i take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down 
 and all the people took note of it and were pleased like everything the king did it was pleasing to the people
 so it was clear to israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of abner the son of ner
 and the king said to his servants do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in israel
 while i though i am crowned king have little strength and these men the sons of zeruiah are out of my control may the lord give to the evil doer the reward of his evil doing 
 and when sauls son ish bosheth had news that abner was dead in hebron his hands became feeble and all the israelites were troubled
 and sauls son had two men captains of bands one named baanah and the other rechab sons of rimmon the beerothite of the tribe of benjamin  for beeroth was at one time taken to be part of benjamin
 but the people of beeroth had gone in flight to gittaim where they have been living to this day 
 now jonathan sauls son had a son whose feet were damaged he was five years old when news of the death of saul and jonathan came from jezreel and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able he had a fall and his feet were damaged his name was mephibosheth
 and rechab and baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite went out and came to the house of ish bosheth in the heat of the day when he was resting in the middle of the day now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain and sleep overcame her
 and rechab and his brother baanah got in without being seen
 and when they came into the house ish bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom and they made an attack on him and put him to death and cutting off his head they took it with them and went by the road through the arabah all night
 and they took the head of ish bosheth to david in hebron and said to the king here is the head of ish bosheth the son of saul your hater who would have taken your life the lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from saul and his seed today
 and david made answer to rechab and his brother baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said to them by the living lord who has kept me safe from all my trouble
 when one came to me with the news of sauls death in the belief that it would be good news i took him and put him to death in ziklag which was the reward i gave him for his news
 how much more when evil men have put an upright person to death in his house sleeping on his bed will i take payment from you for his blood and have you cut off from the earth
 and david gave orders to his young men and they put them to death cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in hebron but they took the head of ish bosheth and put it in its last resting place with abners body in hebron
 then all the tribes of israel came to david in hebron and said truly we are your bone and your flesh
 in the past when saul was king over us it was you who went at the head of israel when they went out or came in and the lord said to you you are to be the keeper of my people israel and their ruler
 so all the responsible men of israel came to the king at hebron and king david made an agreement with them in hebron before the lord and they put the holy oil on david and made him king over israel
 david was thirty years old when he became king and he was king for forty years
 ruling over judah in hebron for seven years and six months and in jerusalem over all israel and judah for thirty three years
 and the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the people of the land and they said to david you will not come in here but the blind and the feeble footed will keep you out for they said david will not be able to come in here
 but david took the strong place of zion which is the town of david
 and that day david said whoever makes an attack on the jebusites let him go up by the water pipe and put to death all the blind and feeble footed who are hated by david and this is why they say the blind and feeble footed may not come into the house
 so david took the strong tower for his living place naming it the town of david and david took in hand the building of the town all round starting from the millo
 and david became greater and greater for the lord the god of armies was with him
 and hiram king of tyre sent men to david with cedar trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers and they made david a house
 and david saw that the lord had made his position safe as king over israel and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people israel
