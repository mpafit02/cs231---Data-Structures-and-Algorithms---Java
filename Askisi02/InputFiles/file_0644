 but you will come down to the underworld even to its inmost parts
 those who see you will be looking on you with care they will be in deep thought saying is this the troubler of the earth the shaker of kingdoms
 who made the world a waste overturning its towns who did not let his prisoners loose from the prison house
 all the kings of the earth are at rest in glory every man in his house
 but you like a birth before its time are stretched out with no resting place in the earth clothed with the bodies of the dead who have been put to the sword who go down to the lowest parts of the underworld a dead body crushed under foot
 as for your fathers you will not be united with them in their resting place because you have been the cause of destruction to your land and of death to your people the seed of the evil doer will have no place in the memory of man
 make ready a place of death for his children because of the evil doing of their father so that they may not come up and take the earth for their heritage covering the face of the world with waste places
 for i will come up against them says the lord of armies cutting off from babylon name and offspring son and sons son says the lord
 and i will make you a heritage for the hedgehog and pools of water and i will go through it with the brush of destruction says the lord of armies
 the lord has taken an oath saying my design will certainly come about and my purpose will be effected
 to let the assyrian be broken in my land and crushed under foot on my mountains there will his yoke be taken away from them and his rule over them come to an end
 this is the purpose for all the earth and this is the hand stretched out over all nations
 for it is the purpose of the lord of armies and who will make it of no effect when his hand is stretched out by whom may it be turned back
 in the year of the death of king ahaz this word came to the prophet
 be not glad o philistia all of you because the rod which was on you is broken for out of the snakes root will come a poison snake and its fruit will be a winged poison snake
 and the poorest of the land will have food and those in need will be given a safe resting place but your seed will come to an end for need of food and the rest of you will be put to the sword
 send out a cry o door  make sounds of sorrow o town  all your land has come to nothing o philistia for there comes a smoke out of the north and everyone keeps his place in the line
 what answer then will my people give to the representatives of the nation that the lord is the builder of zion and she will be a safe place for the poor of his people
 the word about moab for in a night ar of moab has become waste and is seen no longer for in a night kir of moab has become waste and is seen no longer
 the daughter of dibon has gone up to the high places weeping moab is sounding her cry of sorrow over nebo and over medeba everywhere the hair of the head and of the face is cut off
 in their streets they are covering themselves with haircloth on the tops of their houses and in their public places there is crying and bitter weeping
 heshbon is crying out and elealeh their voice is sounding even to jahaz for this cause the heart of moab is shaking his soul is shaking with fear
 my heart is crying out for moab her people go in flight to zoar and to eglath shelishiyah for they go up with weeping by the slope of luhith on the way to horonaim they send up a cry of destruction
 the waters of nimrim will become dry for the grass is burned up the young grass is coming to an end every green thing is dead
 for this cause they will take away their wealth and the stores they have got together over the stream of the water plants
 for the cry has gone round the limits of moab as far as to eglaim and beer elim
 for the waters of dimon are full of blood and im sending even more on moab a lion on those of moab who go in flight and on the rest of the land
 and they will send  to the mountain of the daughter of zion
 for the daughters of moab will be like wandering birds like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight at the ways across the arnon
 give wise directions make a decision let your shade be as night in full day keep safe those who are in flight do not give up the wandering ones
