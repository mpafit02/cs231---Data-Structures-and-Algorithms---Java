 go in flight out of jerusalem so that you may be safe you children of benjamin and let the horn be sounded in tekoa and the flag be lifted up on beth haccherem for evil is looking out from the north and a great destruction
 the fair and delicate one the daughter of zion will be cut off by my hand
 keepers of sheep with their flocks will come to her they will put up their tents round her everyone will get food in his place
 make war ready against her up  let us go up when the sun is high sorrow is ours  for the day is turned and the shades of evening are stretched out
 up  let us go up by night and send destruction on her great houses
 for this is what the lord of armies has said let trees be cut down and an earthwork be placed against jerusalem sorrow on the false town  inside her there is nothing but cruel ways
 as the spring keeps its waters cold so she keeps her evil in her the sound of cruel and violent behaviour is in her before me at all times are disease and wounds
 undergo teaching o jerusalem or my soul will be turned away from you and i will make you a waste an unpeopled land
 this is what the lord of armies has said everything will be taken from the rest of israel as the last grapes are taken from the vine let your hand be turned to the small branches like one pulling off grapes
