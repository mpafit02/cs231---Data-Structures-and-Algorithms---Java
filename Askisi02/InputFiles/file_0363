 now from the time when amaziah gave up worshipping the lord they made secret designs against him in jerusalem and he went in flight to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and put him to death there
 and they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of david
 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father amaziah
 he was the builder of eloth which he got back for judah after the death of the king
 uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for fifty two years his mothers name was jechiliah of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father amaziah had done
 he gave himself to searching after god in the days of zechariah who made men wise in the fear of god and as long as he was true to the lord god made things go well for him
 he went out and made war against the philistines pulling down the walls of gath and jabneh and ashdod and building towns in the country round ashdod and among the philistines
 and god gave him help against the philistines and against the arabians living in gur baal and against the meunim
 the ammonites gave offerings to uzziah and news of him went out as far as the limit of egypt for he became very great in power
 uzziah made towers in jerusalem at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall arming them
 and he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water for he had much cattle in the low hills and in the table land and he had farmers and vine keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land for he was a lover of farming
 in addition uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war in bands as they had been listed by jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the authority of hananiah one of the kings captains
 the heads of families the strong men of war were two thousand six hundred
 and under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred of great strength in war helping the king against any who came against him
 and uzziah had all these forces armed with body covers and spears and head covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands
 and in jerusalem he made machines the invention of expert men to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones and his name was honoured far and wide for he was greatly helped till he was strong
 but when he had become strong his heart was lifted up in pride causing his destruction and he did evil against the lord his god for he went into the temple of the lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes
 and azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of the lords priests who were strong men
 and they made protests to uzziah the king and said to him the burning of perfumes uzziah is not your business but that of the priests the sons of aaron who have been made holy for this work go out of the holy place for you have done wrong and it will not be to your honour before god
 then uzziah was angry and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume and while his wrath was bitter against the priests the mark of the lepers disease came out on his brow before the eyes of the priests in the house of the lord by the altar of perfumes
 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looking at him saw the mark of the leper on his brow and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away for the lords punishment had come on him
 so king uzziah was a leper till the day of his death living separately in his private house for he was cut off from the house of god and jotham his son was ruling over his house judging the people of the land
 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last were recorded by isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 so uzziah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting place of the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son became king in his place
 jotham was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for sixteen years and his mothers name was jerushah the daughter of zadok
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father uzziah had done but he did not go into the temple of the lord and the people still went on in their evil ways
 he put up the higher doorway of the house of the lord and did much building on the wall of the ophel
 in addition he made towns in the hill country of judah and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands
 he went to war with the king of the children of ammon and overcame them that year the children of ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley and the children of ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third
