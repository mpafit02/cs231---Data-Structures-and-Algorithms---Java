 and berechiah and elkanah were door keepers for the ark
 and shebaniah and joshaphat and nethanel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests made music on the horns before the ark of god and obed edom and jehiah were door keepers for the ark
 so david and the responsible men of israel and the captains over thousands went with joy to get the ark of the agreement of the lord out of the house of obed edom
 and when god gave help to the levites who were lifting up the ark of the agreement of the lord they made an offering of seven oxen and seven sheep
 and david was clothed with a robe of fair linen as were all the levites who took up the ark and those who made melody and chenaniah the master of those who made melody and david had on a linen ephod
 so all israel took up the ark of the agreement of the lord with loud cries and with horns and brass and corded instruments sounding loudly
 and when the ark of the agreement of the lord came into the town of david michal the daughter of saul looking out of the window saw king david dancing and playing and to her mind he seemed foolish
 then they took in the ark of god and put it inside the tent which david had put up for it and they made offerings burned offerings and peace offerings before god
 and when david had come to an end of making the burned offerings and peace offerings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the lord
 and he gave to everyone every man and woman of israel a cake of bread some meat and a cake of dry grapes
 and he put some of the levites before the ark of the lord as servants to keep the acts of the lord in memory and to give worship and praise to the lord the god of israel
 asaph the chief and second to him zechariah uzziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obed edom and jeiel with corded instruments of music and asaph with brass instruments sounding loudly
 and benaiah and jahaziel the priests blowing horns all the time before the ark of the agreement of god
 then on that day david first made the giving of praise to the lord the work of asaph and his brothers
 o give praise to the lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
 let your voice be sounded in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
 have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the lord be glad
 let your search be for the lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
 keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
 o you seed of israel his servant you children of jacob his loved ones
 he is the lord our god he is judge of all the earth
 he has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
 the agreement which he made with abraham and his oath to isaac
 and he gave it to jacob for a law and to israel for an eternal agreement
 saying to you will i give the land of canaan the measured line of your heritage
 when you were still small in number and strange in the land
 when they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
 he would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
 saying put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
 make songs to the lord all the earth give the good news of his salvation day by day
