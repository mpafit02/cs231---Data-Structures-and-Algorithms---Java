 and king solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada and he made an attack on him and put him to death
 and to abiathar the priest the king said go to anathoth to your fields for death would be your right reward but i will not put you to death now because you took up the ark of the lord god before david my father and you were with him in all his troubles
 so solomon let abiathar be priest no longer so that he might make the word of the lord come true which he said about the sons of eli in shiloh
 and news of this came to joab for joab had been one of adonijahs supporters though he had not been on absaloms side then joab went in flight to the tent of the lord and put his hands on the horns of the altar
 and they said to king solomon joab has gone in flight to the tent of the lord and is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go make an attack on him
 and benaiah came to the tent of the lord and said to him the king says come out and he said no but let death come to me here and benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which joab had given
 and the king said do as he has said and make an attack on him there and put his body into the earth so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by joab without cause
 and the lord will send back his blood on his head because of the attack he made on two men more upright and better than himself putting them to the sword without my fathers knowledge even abner the son of ner captain of the army of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the army of judah
 so their blood will be on the head of joab and on the head of his seed for ever but for david and his seed and his family and the seat of his kingdom there will be peace for ever from the lord
 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and falling on him put him to death and his body was put to rest in his house in the waste land
 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his place over the army and zadok the priest he put in the place of abiathar
 then the king sent for shimei and said to him make a house for yourself in jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place
 for be certain that on the day when you go out and go over the stream kidron death will overtake you and your blood will be on your head
 and shimei said to the king very well  as my lord the king has said so will your servant do and for a long time shimei went on living in jerusalem
 but after three years two of the servants of shimei went in flight to achish son of maacah king of gath and word was given to shimei that his servants had gone to gath
 then shimei got up and making ready his ass he went to gath to achish in search of his servants and he sent and got them from gath
 and news was given to solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and had come back again
 then the king sent for shimei and said to him did i not make you take an oath by the lord protesting to you and saying be certain that on the day when you go out from here wherever you go death will overtake you and you said to me very well 
 why then have you not kept the oath of the lord and the order which i gave you
 and the king said to shimei you have knowledge of all the evil which you did to david my father and now the lord has sent back your evil on yourself
 but a blessing will be on king solomon and the kingdom of david will keep its place before the lord for ever
 so the king gave orders to benaiah the son of jehoiada and he went out and falling on him put him to death and solomons authority over the kingdom was complete
 now ben hadad king of aram got all his army together and thirty two kings with him and horses and carriages of war he went up and made war on samaria shutting it in
 and he sent representatives into the town to ahab king of israel
 and they said to him ben hadad says your silver and your gold are mine and your wives and children are mine
 and the king of israel sent him an answer saying as you say my lord king i am yours with all i have
 then the representatives came back again and said these are the words of ben hadad i sent to you saying give up to me your silver and your gold your wives and your children
 but i will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time to make a search through your house and the houses of your people and everything which is pleasing in your eyes they will take away in their hands
 then the king of israel sent for all the responsible men of the land and said now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man he sent for my wives and my children my silver and my gold and i did not keep them back
 and all the responsible men and the people said to him do not give attention to him or do what he says
