 it is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young
 let him be seated by himself saying nothing because he has put it on him
 let him put his mouth in the dust if by chance there may be hope
 let his face be turned to him who gives him blows let him be full of shame
 for the lord does not give a man up for ever
 for though he sends grief still he will have pity in the full measure of his love
 for he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men
 in a mans crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth
 in his turning away the right of a man before the face of the most high
 in his doing wrong to a man in his cause the lord has no pleasure
 who is able to say a thing and give effect to it if it has not been ordered by the lord
 do not evil and good come from the mouth of the most high
 what protest may a living man make even a man about the punishment of his sin
 let us make search and put our ways to the test turning again to the lord
 lifting up our hearts with our hands to god in the heavens
 we have done wrong and gone against your law we have not had your forgiveness
 covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us cutting us off without pity
 covering yourself with a cloud so that prayer may not get through
 you have made us like waste and that for which there is no use among the peoples
 the mouths of all our haters are open wide against us
 fear and deep waters have come on us wasting and destruction
 rivers of water are running down from my eyes for the destruction of the daughter of my people
 my eyes are streaming without stopping they have no rest
 till the lords eye is turned on me till he sees my trouble from heaven
 the lord is unkind to my soul more than all the daughters of my town
 they who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if i was a bird
 they have put an end to my life in the prison stoning me with stones
 waters were flowing over my head i said i am cut off
 i was making prayer to your name o lord out of the lowest prison
 my voice came to you let not your ear be shut to my breathing to my cry
