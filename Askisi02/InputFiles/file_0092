 this is the agreement which i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts writing them in their minds he said
 and i will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil doings
 now where there is forgiveness of these there is no more offering for sin
 so then my brothers being able to go into the holy place without fear because of the blood of jesus
 by the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
 and having a great priest over the house of god
 let us go in with true hearts in certain faith having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water
 let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking for he is true who has given his word
 and let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works
 not giving up our meetings as is the way of some but keeping one another strong in faith and all the more because you see the day coming near
 for if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true there is no more offering for sins
 but only a great fear of being judged and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of god
 a man who has gone against the law of moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses
 but will not the man by whom the son of god has been crushed under foot and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing and who has had no respect for the spirit of grace be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment
 for we have had experience of him who says punishment is mine i will give reward and again the lord will be judge of his people
 we may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living god
 but give thought to the days after you had seen the light when you went through a great war of troubles
 in part in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts before the eyes of everyone and in part in being united with those who were attacked in this way
 for you had pity on those who were in prison and had joy in the loss of your property in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever
 so do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded
 for having done what was right in gods eyes you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you
 in a very little time he who is coming will come he will not be slow
 but the upright man will be living by his faith and if he goes back my soul will have no pleasure in him
 but we are not of those who go back to destruction but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul
 now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the sign that the things not seen are true
 for by it our fathers had gods approval
 by faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of god so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be
 by faith abel made a better offering to god than cain and he had witness through it of his righteousness god giving his approval of his offering and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead
 by faith enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death he was seen no longer for god took him away for before he was taken witness had been given that he was well pleasing to god
 and without faith it is not possible to be well pleasing to him for it is necessary for anyone who comes to god to have the belief that god is and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him
