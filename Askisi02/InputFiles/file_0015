 but even as the good news was given to us by the approval of god so we give it out not as pleasing men but god by whom our hearts are tested
 for it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth sounding false words and god is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves
 or looking for glory from men from you or from others when we might have made ourselves a care to you as apostles of christ
 but we were gentle among you like a woman caring for her little ones
 even so being full of loving desire for you we took delight in giving you not only gods good news but even our lives because you were dear to us
 for you have the memory my brothers of our trouble and care how working night and day so that we might not be a trouble to any of you we gave you the good news of god
 you are witnesses with god how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith
 even as you saw how like a father with his children we were teaching and comforting you all and giving witness
 so that your lives might be pleasing to god who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory
 and for this cause we still give praise to god that when the word came to your ears through us you took it not as the word of man but as it truly is the word of god which has living power in you who have faith
 for you my brothers took as your examples the churches of god which are in judaea in christ jesus because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the jews
 who put to death the lord jesus and the prophets violently driving us out who are unpleasing to god and against all men
 who to make the measure of their sins complete kept us from giving the word of salvation to the gentiles but the wrath of god is about to come on them in the fullest degree
 but we my brothers being away from you for a short time in body but not in heart had all the more desire to see your face
 for which reason we made attempts to come to you even i paul once and again but satan kept us from coming
 for what is our hope or joy or crown of glory are not even you before our lord jesus at his coming
 for you are our glory and our joy
 at last our desire to have news of you was so strong that while we ourselves were waiting at athens
 we sent timothy our brother and gods servant in the good news of christ to give you strength and comfort in your faith
 so that no man might be moved by these troubles because you see that these things are part of gods purpose for us
 and when we were with you we said to you that trouble was before us and so it came about as you see
 for this reason when i was no longer able to keep quiet i sent to get news of your faith fearing that you might be tested by the evil one and that our work might come to nothing
 but now that timothy has come to us from you and has given us good news of your faith and love and that you have happy memories of us desiring greatly to see us even as we do to see you
 for this cause brothers in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith
 for it is life to us if you keep your faith in the lord unchanged
 for how great is the praise which we give to god for you and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our god
 night and day requesting god again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete
 now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus make a way for us to come to you
 and the lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men even as our love to you
 so that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints
