 if we have been planting the things of the spirit for you does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world
 if others have a part in this right over you have we not even more but we did not make use of our right so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of christ
 do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the temple and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar
 even so did the lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news
 but i have not made use of any of these things and i am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me for it would be better for me to undergo death than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect
 for if i am a preacher of the good news i have no cause for pride in this because i am forced to do so for a curse is on me if i do not
 but if i do it gladly i have a reward and if not i am under orders to do it
 what then is my reward this that when i am giving the good news i may give it without payment not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news
 for though i was free from all men i made myself a servant to all so that more might have salvation
 and to the jews i was as a jew so that i might give the good news to them to those under the law i was the same not as being myself under the law but so that i might give the good news to those under the law
 to those without the law i was as one without the law not as being without law to god but as under law to christ so that i might give the good news to those without the law
 to the feeble i was as one who is feeble so that they might have salvation i have been all things to all men so that some at least might have salvation
 and i do all things for the cause of the good news so that i may have a part in it
 do you not see that in a running competition all take part but only one gets the reward so let your minds be fixed on the reward
 and every man who takes part in the sports has self control in all things now they do it to get a crown which is of this world but we for an eternal crown
 so then i am running not uncertainly so i am fighting not as one who gives blows in the air
 but i give blows to my body and keep it under control for fear that after having given the good news to others i myself might not have gods approval
 paul and silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace
 we give praise to god at all times for you keeping you in memory in our prayers
 having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our lord jesus christ before our god and father
 being conscious my brothers dear to god that you have been marked out by gods purpose
 because our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the holy spirit so that you were completely certain of it even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you
 and you took us and the lord as your example after the word had come to you in much trouble with joy in the holy spirit
 so that you became an example to all those who have faith in christ in macedonia and achaia
 for not only was the word of the lord sounding out from you in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god is made clear so that we have no need to say anything
 for they themselves give the news of how we came among you and how you were turned from images to god to the worship of a true and living god
 waiting for his son from heaven who came back from the dead even jesus our saviour from the wrath to come
 for you yourselves brothers are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect
 but after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw at philippi by the help of god we gave you the good news without fear though everything was against us
 for our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit
