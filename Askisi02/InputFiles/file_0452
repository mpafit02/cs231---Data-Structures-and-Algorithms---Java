 for the hand of the lord was against them working their destruction till all were dead
 so when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people
 the word of the lord came to me saying
 you are about to go by ar the limit of the country of moab
 and when you come near the land of the children of ammon give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them for i will not give you any of the land of the children of ammon for your heritage because i have given it to the children of lot
  that land is said to have been a land of the rephaim for rephaim had been living there in earlier times but they were named zamzummim by the ammonites
 they were a great people tall as the anakim and equal to them in number but the lord sent destruction on them and the children of ammon took their place living in their land
 as he did for the children of esau living in seir when he sent destruction on the horites before them and they took their land where they are living to this day
 and the avvim living in the small towns as far as gaza came to destruction by the hands of the caphtorim who came out from caphtor and took their land 
 get up now and go on your journey crossing over the valley of the arnon see i have given into your hands sihon the amorite king of heshbon and all his land go forward to make it yours and make war on him
 from now on i will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven who hearing of you will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you
 then from the waste land of kedemoth i sent representatives to sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying
 let me go through your land i will keep to the highway not turning to the right or to the left
 let me have food at a price for my needs and water for drinking only let me go through on foot
 as the children of esau did for me in seir and the moabites in ar till i have gone over jordan into the land which the lord our god is giving us
 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us go through for the lord your god made his spirit hard and his heart strong so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day
 and the lord said to me see from now on i have given sihon and his land into your hands go forward now to take his land and make it yours
 then sihon came out against us with all his people to make an attack on us at jahaz
 and the lord our god gave him into our hands and we overcame him and his sons and all his people
 at that time we took all his towns and gave them over to complete destruction together with men women and children we had no mercy on any
 only the cattle we took for ourselves with the goods from the towns we had taken
 from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon and from the town in the valley as far as gilead no town was strong enough to keep us out the lord our god gave them all into our hands
 but you did not go near the land of the children of ammon that is all the side of the river jabbok or the towns of the hill country wherever the lord our god had said we were not to go
 when you go out to war against other nations and come face to face with horses and war carriages and armies greater in number than yourselves have no fear of them for the lord your god is with you who took you up out of the land of egypt
 and when you are on the point of attacking let the priest come forward and say to the people
 give ear o israel today you are going forward to the fight let your heart be strong do not let uncontrolled fear overcome you because of those who are against you
 for the lord your god goes with you fighting for you to give you salvation from those who are against you
 and let the overseers say to the people if there is any man who has made for himself a new house and has not gone into it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not take his house for himself
 or if any man has made a vine garden without taking the first fruits of it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not be the first to make use of the fruit
 or if any man is newly married and has had no sex relations with his wife let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another man may not take her
