 and he said to them without doubt you will say to me let the medical man make himself well the things which to our knowledge were done at capernaum do them here in your country
 and he said to them truly i say to you no prophet is honoured in his country
 truly i say to you there were a number of widows in israel in the days of elijah when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land
 but elijah was not sent to one of them but only to zarephath in the land of sidon to a woman who was a widow
 and there were a number of lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and not one of them was made clean but only naaman the syrian
 and all who were in the synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them
 and they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was so that they might send him down to his death
 but he came through them and went on his way
 and he came down to capernaum a town of galilee and he was giving them teaching on the sabbath
 and they were surprised at his teaching for his word was with authority
 and there was a man in the synagogue who had an unclean spirit and he gave a loud cry and said
 let us be  what have we to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to put an end to us i have knowledge who you are the holy one of god
 and jesus said to him be quiet and come out of him and when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them he came out of him having done him no damage
 and wonder came on them all and they said to one another what are these words for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out
 and there was much talk about him in all the places round about
 and he got up and went out of the synagogue and went into the house of simon and simons wifes mother was very ill with a burning heat and in answer to their prayers for her
 he went near her and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her and straight away she got up and took care of their needs
 and at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease took them to him and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well
 and evil spirits came out of a number of them crying out and saying you are the son of god but he gave them sharp orders not to say a word because they had knowledge that he was the christ
 and when it was day he came out and went to a waste place and great numbers of people came looking for him and they came to him and would have kept him from going away
 but he said to them i have to give the good news of the kingdom of god in other towns because that is why i was sent
 and he was teaching in the synagogues of galilee
 now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him and to have knowledge of the word of god he was by a wide stretch of water named gennesaret
 and he saw two boats by the edge of the water but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
 and he got into one of the boats the property of simon and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land and being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat
 and when his talk was ended he said to simon go out into deep water and let down your nets for fish
 and simon answering said master we were working all night and we took nothing but at your word i will let down the nets
 and when they had done this they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken
 and they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help and they came and the two boats were so full that they were going down
 but simon when he saw it went down at the knees of jesus and said go away from me o lord for i am a sinner
