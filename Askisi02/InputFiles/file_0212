 but how does it seem to you a man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go and do work today in the vine garden
 and he said in answer i will not but later changing his decision he went
 and he came to the second and said the same and he made answer and said i go sir and went not
 which of the two did his fathers pleasure they say the first jesus said to them truly i say to you that tax farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of god before you
 for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you had no faith in him but the tax farmers and the loose women had faith in him and you when you saw it did not even have regret for your sins so as to have faith in him
 give ear to another story a master of a house made a vine garden and put a wall round it and made a place for crushing out the wine and made a tower and let it out to field workers and went into another country
 and when the time for the fruit came near he sent his servants to the workmen to get the fruit
 and the workmen made an attack on his servants giving blows to one putting another to death and stoning another
 again he sent other servants more in number than the first and they did the same to them
 but after that he sent his son to them saying they will have respect for my son
 but when the workmen saw the son they said among themselves this is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and take his heritage
 and they took him and driving him out of the vine garden put him to death
 when then the lord of the vine garden comes what will he do to those workmen
 they say to him he will put those cruel men to a cruel death and will let out the vine garden to other workmen who will give him the fruit when it is ready
 jesus says to them did you never see in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same has been made the chief stone of the building this was the lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
 for this reason i say to you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it
 any man falling on this stone will be broken but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust
 and when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the pharisees they saw that he was talking of them
 and though they had a desire to take him they were in fear of the people because in their eyes he was a prophet
 and jesus talking to them again in stories said
 the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a feast when his son was married
 and sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast and they would not come
 again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests see i have made ready my feast my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death and all things are ready come to the feast
 but they gave no attention and went about their business one to his farm another to his trade
 and the rest put violent hands on his servants and did evil to them and put them to death
 but the king was angry and he sent his armies and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction burning down their town with fire
 then he said to his servants the feast is ready but the guests were not good enough
 go then to the cross roads and get all those whom you see to come to the bride feast
 and those servants went out into the streets and got together all those whom they came across bad and good and the feast was full of guests
 but when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man who had not on a guests robe
