 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the town of sepharvaim of hena and of ivvah
 and hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it hezekiah went up to the house of the lord opening the letter there before the lord
 and hezekiah made his prayer to the lord saying o lord the god of israel seated between the winged ones you only are the god of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
 let your ear be turned to us o lord and let your eyes be open o lord and see take note of all the words of sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living god
 truly o lord the kings of assyria have made waste the nations and their lands
 and have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
 but now o lord our god give us salvation from his hands so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you o lord are god
 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying the lord the god of israel says the prayer which you have made to me against sennacherib king of assyria has come to my ears
 this is the word which the lord has said about him in the eyes of the virgin daughter of zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of jerusalem has made sport of you
 against whom have you said evil and bitter things against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the holy one of israel
 you have sent your servants with evil words against the lord and have said with all my war carriages i have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of lebanon its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods i will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
 i have made water holes and taken their waters and with my foot i have made all the rivers of egypt dry
 has it not come to your ears how i did it long before purposing it in times long past now i have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
 this is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field and the green plant like grass on the house tops
 but i have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
 because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and i will make you go back by the way you came
 and this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine gardens and take of their fruit
 and those of judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
 for from jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of mount zion by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done
 for this cause the lord says about the king of assyria he will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
 by the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town says the lord
 for i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 and that night the angel of the lord went out and put to death in the army of the assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
 so sennacherib king of assyria went back to his place at nineveh
 and it came about when he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that his sons adrammelech and sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of ararat and esar haddon his son became king in his place
 now when the lord was about to take elijah up to heaven in a great wind elijah went with elisha from gilgal
 and elijah said to elisha come no farther for the lord has sent me to beth el but elisha said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went down to beth el
 and at beth el the sons of the prophets came out to elisha and said has it been made clear to you that the lord is going to take away your master from over you today and he said yes i have knowledge of it say no more
 then elijah said to him come no farther for the lord has sent me to jericho but he said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went on to jericho
 and at jericho the sons of the prophets came up to elisha and said to him has it been made clear to you that the lord is going to take away your master from over you today and he said in answer yes i have knowledge of it say no more
