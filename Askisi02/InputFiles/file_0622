 and israel said to joseph now that i have seen you living again i am ready for death
 and joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers people i will go and give the news to pharaoh and say to him my brothers and my fathers people from the land of canaan have come to me
 and these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have
 now when pharaoh sends for you and says what is your business
 you are to say your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now like our fathers in this way you will be able to have the land of goshen for yourselves because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the egyptians
 then joseph went to pharaoh and said my father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all they have are come from canaan and are now in the land of goshen
 and he took five of his brothers to pharaoh
 and pharaoh said to them what is your business and they said your servants are keepers of sheep as our fathers were before us
 and they said to pharaoh we have come to make a living in this land because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of canaan so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of goshen
 and pharaoh said to joseph let them have the land of goshen and if there are any able men among them put them over my cattle
 and jacob and his sons came to joseph in egypt and when word of it came to the ears of pharaoh king of egypt he said to joseph your father and brothers have come to you all the land of egypt is before you let your father and your brothers have the best of the land for their resting place
 then joseph made his father jacob come before pharaoh and jacob gave him his blessing
 and pharaoh said to him how old are you
 and jacob said the years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers
 and jacob gave pharaoh his blessing and went out from before him
 and joseph made a place for his father and his brothers and gave them a heritage in the land of egypt in the best of the land the land of rameses as pharaoh had given orders
 and joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his fathers people giving them food for the needs of their families
 now there was no food to be had in all the land so that all egypt and canaan were wasted from need of food
 and all the money in egypt and in the land of canaan which had been given for grain came into the hands of joseph and he put it in pharaohs house
 and when all the money in egypt and canaan was gone the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread would you have us come to destruction before your eyes for we have no more money
 and joseph said give me your cattle i will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone
 so they took their cattle to joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle
 and when that year was ended they came to him in the second year and said we may not keep it from our lords knowledge that all our money is gone and all the herds of cattle are my lords there is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our land
 are we to come to destruction before your eyes we and our land take us and our land and give us bread and we and our land will be servants to pharaoh and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may not become waste
 so joseph got all the land in egypt for pharaoh for every egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food because of their great need so all the land became pharaohs
 and as for the people he made servants of them town by town from one end of egypt to the other
 only he did not take the land of the priests for the priests had their food given them by pharaoh and having what pharaoh gave them they had no need to give up their land
 then joseph said to the people i have made you and your land this day the property of pharaoh here is seed for you to put in your fields
 and when the grain is cut you are to give a fifth part to pharaoh and four parts will be yours for seed and food and for your families and your little ones
 and they said to him truly you have kept us from death may we have grace in your eyes and we will be pharaohs servants
