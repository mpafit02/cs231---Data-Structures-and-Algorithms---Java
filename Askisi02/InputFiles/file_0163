 and jesus full of the holy spirit came back from the jordan and was guided by the spirit in the waste land
 for forty days being tested by the evil one and he had no food in those days and when they came to an end he was in need of food
 and the evil one said to him if you are the son of god give orders to this stone to become bread
 and jesus made answer to him it has been said in the writings bread is not mans only need
 and he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time
 and the evil one said i will give you authority over all these and the glory of them for it has been given to me and i give it to anyone at my pleasure
 if then you will give worship to me it will all be yours
 and jesus in answer said to him it has been said in the writings give worship to the lord your god and be his servant only
 and he took him to jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the temple and said to him if you are the son of god let yourself go down from here for it is said in the writings
 he will give his angels orders to take care of you
 and in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 and jesus made answer and said to him it is said in the writings you may not put the lord your god to the test
 and when all these tests were ended the evil one went away from him for a time
 and jesus came back to galilee in the power of the spirit and the news of him went through all the country round about
 and he was teaching in their synagogues and all men gave him praise
 and he came to nazareth where he had been as a child and he went as his way was into the synagogue on the sabbath and got up to give a reading
 and the book of the prophet isaiah was given to him and opening the book he came on the place where it is said
 the spirit of the lord is on me because i am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make well those who are broken hearted to say that the prisoners will be let go and the blind will see and to make the wounded free from their chains
 to give knowledge that the year of the lords good pleasure is come
 and shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
 then he said to them today this word has come true in your hearing
 and they were all giving witness with wonder to the words of grace which came from his mouth and they said is not this the son of joseph
