 and he put the male sheep of the burned offering before the lord and aaron and his sons put their hands on its head
 and he put it to death and moses put some of the blood on and round the altar
 and when the sheep had been cut into parts the head and the parts and the fat were burned by moses
 and the inside parts and the legs were washed with water and all the sheep was burned by moses on the altar it was a burned offering for a sweet smell it was an offering made by fire to the lord as the lord gave orders to moses
 and he put the other sheep before the lord the sheep with which they were made priests and aaron and his sons put their hands on the head of the sheep
 and he put it to death and moses took some of the blood and put it on the point of aarons right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot
 then he took aarons sons and moses put some of the blood on the point of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet and moses put the blood on and round the altar
 and he took the fat and the fat tail and the fat on the inside parts and the fat on the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right leg
 and out of the basket of unleavened bread which was before the lord he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread with oil on it and one thin cake and put them on the fat and on the right leg
 and he put them all on the hands of aaron and on the hands of his sons waving them for a wave offering before the lord
 and moses took them from their hands and they were burned on the altar on the burned offering as a priests offering for a sweet smell an offering made by fire to the lord
 and moses took the breast waving it for a wave offering before the lord it was moses part of the sheep of the priests offering as the lord gave orders to moses
 and moses took some of the holy oil and of the blood which was on the altar and put it on aaron and on his robes and on his sons and on his sons robes and made aaron holy and his robes and his sons and his sons robes with him
 and moses said to aaron and to his sons the flesh is to be cooked in water at the door of the tent of meeting and there you are to take it as food together with the bread in the basket as i have given orders saying it is the food of aaron and his sons
 and that which is over of the flesh and of the bread is to be burned with fire
 and you are not to go out from the door of the tent of meeting for seven days till the days for making you priest are ended for this will be the work of seven days
 what has been done this day has been ordered by the lord to take away your sin
 and you are to keep watch for the lord at the door of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days so that death may not come to you for so he has given me orders
 and aaron and his sons did all the things about which the lord had given orders through moses
 and on the eighth day moses sent for aaron and his sons and the responsible men of israel
 and he said to aaron take a young ox for a sin offering and a male sheep for a burned offering without a mark and make an offering of them before the lord
 and say to the children of israel take a he goat for a sin offering and a young ox and a lamb in their first year without any mark on them for a burned offering
 and an ox and a male sheep for peace offerings to be put to death before the lord and a meal offering mixed with oil for this day you are to see the lord
 and they took the things ordered by moses before the tent of meeting and all the people came near waiting before the lord
 and moses said this is what the lord has said you are to do and you will see the glory of the lord
 and moses said to aaron come near to the altar and make your sin offering and your burned offering to take away your sin and the sin of the people and make the peoples offering to take away their sin as the lord has given orders
