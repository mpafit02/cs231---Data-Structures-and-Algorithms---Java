 and you are complete in him who is the head of all rule and authority
 in whom you had a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ
 having been put to death with him in baptism by which you came to life again with him through faith in the working of god who made him come back from the dead
 and you being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh to you i say he gave life together with him and forgiveness of all our sins
 having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross
 having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers he put them openly to shame glorying over them in it
 for this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or sabbaths
 for these are an image of the things which are to come but the body is christs
 let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind
 and not joined to the head from whom all the body being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands has its growth with the increase of god
 if you were made free by your death with christ from the rules of the world why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders
 which say there may be no touching tasting or taking in your hands
  rules which are all to come to an end with their use  after the orders and teaching of men
 these things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self ordered worship and making little of oneself and being cruel to the body not honouring it by giving it its natural use
 if then you have a new life with christ give your attention to the things of heaven where christ is seated at the right hand of god
 keep your mind on the higher things not on the things of earth
 for your life on earth is done and you have a secret life with christ in god
 at the coming of christ who is our life you will be seen with him in glory
 then put to death your bodies which are of the earth wrong use of the flesh unclean things passion evil desires and envy which is the worship of strange gods
 because of which the wrath of god comes on those who go against his orders
 among whom you were living in the past when you did such things
 but now it is right for you to put away all these things wrath passion bad feeling curses unclean talk
 do not make false statements to one another because you have put away the old man with all his doings
 and have put on the new man which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker
 where there is no greek or jew no one with circumcision or without circumcision no division between nations no servant or free man but christ is all and in all
 as saints of god then holy and dearly loved let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy kind feeling a low opinion of yourselves gentle ways and a power of undergoing all things
 being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another if anyone has done wrong to his brother even as the lord had forgiveness for you
 and more than all have love the only way in which you may be completely joined together
 and let the peace of christ be ruling in your hearts as it was the purpose of god for you to be one body and give praise to god at all times
 let the word of christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words making melody to god with grace in your hearts
