 for this cause men go in fear of him he has no respect for any who are wise in heart
 and the lord made answer to job out of the storm wind and said
 who is this who makes the purpose of god dark by words without knowledge
 get your strength together like a man of war i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 where were you when i put the earth on its base say if you have knowledge
 by whom were its measures fixed say if you have wisdom or by whom was the line stretched out over it
 on what were its pillars based or who put down its angle stone
 when the morning stars made songs together and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy
 or where were you when the sea came to birth pushing out from its secret place
 when i made the cloud its robe and put thick clouds as bands round it
 ordering a fixed limit for it with locks and doors
 and said so far you may come and no farther and here the pride of your waves will be stopped
 have you from your earliest days given orders to the morning or made the dawn conscious of its place
 so that it might take a grip of the skirts of the earth shaking all the evil doers out of it
 it is changed like wet earth under a stamp and is coloured like a robe
 and from the evil doers their light is kept back and the arm of pride is broken
 have you come into the springs of the sea walking in the secret places of the deep
 have the doors of death been open to you or have the door keepers of the dark ever seen you
 have you taken note of the wide limits of the earth say if you have knowledge of it all
 which is the way to the resting place of the light and where is the store house of the dark
 so that you might take it to its limit guiding it to its house
 no doubt you have knowledge of it for then you had come to birth and the number of your days is great
 have you come into the secret place of snow or have you seen the store houses of the ice drops
 which i have kept for the time of trouble for the day of war and fighting
 which is the way to the place where the wind is measured out and the east wind sent out over the earth
 by whom has the way been cut for the flowing of the rain and the flaming of the thunder
 causing rain to come on a land where no man is living on the waste land which has no people
 to give water to the land where there is waste and destruction and to make the dry land green with young grass
 has the rain a father or who gave birth to the drops of night mist
 out of whose body came the ice and who gave birth to the cold mist of heaven
