 take the first fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the lord your god let not the young goat be cooked in its mothers milk
 and the lord said to moses put all these words in writing for on them is based the agreement which i will make with you
 and for forty days and forty nights moses was there with the lord and in that time he had no food or drink and he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement the ten rules of the law
 now when moses came down from mount sinai with the two stones in his hand he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with god
 but when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses and the shining of his face they would not come near him for fear
 then moses sent for them and aaron with the chiefs of the people came to him and moses had talk with them
 and later all the children of israel came near and he gave them all the orders which the lord had given him on mount sinai
 and at the end of his talk with them moses put a veil over his face
 but whenever moses went in before the lord to have talk with him he took off the veil till he came out and whenever he came out he said to the children of israel what he had been ordered to say
 and the children of israel saw that the face of moses was shining so moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the lord
 and moses sent for all the children of israel to come together and said to them this is what the lord has said and these are his orders
 six days let work be done but the seventh day is to be a holy day to you a sabbath of rest to the lord whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death
 no fire is to be lighted in any of your houses on the sabbath day
 and moses said to all the meeting of the children of israel this is the order which the lord has given
 take from among you an offering to the lord everyone who has the impulse in his heart let him give his offering to the lord gold and silver and brass
 and blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair
 and sheepskins coloured red and leather and hard wood
 and oil for the lights and spices for the holy oil and for the sweet perfumes for burning
 and beryls and jewels to be cut for the ephod and for the priests bag
 and let every wise hearted man among you come and make whatever has been ordered by the lord
 the house and its tent and its cover its hooks and its boards its rods and its pillars and its bases
 the ark with its cover and its rods and the veil hanging before it
 the table and its rods and all its vessels and the holy bread
 and the support for the lights with its vessels and its lights and the oil for the light
 and the altar for burning spices with its rods and the holy oil and the sweet perfume and the curtain for the door at the door of the house
 the altar of burned offerings with its network of brass its rods and all its vessels the washing vessel and its base
 the hangings for the open space its pillars and their bases and the curtain for the doorway
