 but when it is turned to the lord the veil will be taken away
 now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there the heart is free
 but we all with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as from the lord who is the spirit
 for this reason because we have been made servants of this new order through the mercy given to us we are strong
 and we have given up the secret things of shame not walking in false ways and not making use of the word of god with deceit but by the revelation of what is true as before god we have the approval of every mans sense of right and wrong
 but if our good news is veiled it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction
 because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith so that the light of the good news of the glory of christ who is the image of god might not be shining on them
 for our preaching is not about ourselves but about christ jesus as lord and ourselves as your servants through jesus
 seeing that it is god who said let light be shining out of the dark who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
 but we have this wealth in vessels of earth so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from god
 troubles are round us on every side but we are not shut in things are hard for us but we see a way out of them
 we are cruelly attacked but not without hope we are made low but we are not without help
 in our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may be seen in our bodies
 for while living we are still being given up to death because of jesus so that the life of jesus may be seen in our flesh though it is under the power of death
 so then death is working in us but life in you
 but having the same spirit of faith as it is said in the writings the words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart in the same way our words are the outcome of our faith
 because we are certain that he who made the lord jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us and will give us a place in his glory with you
 for we go through all things on account of you because the greater the number to whom the grace is given the greater is the praise to the glory of god
 for which cause we do not give way to weariness but though our outer man is getting feebler our inner man is made new day by day
 for our present trouble which is only for a short time is working out for us a much greater weight of glory
 while our minds are not on the things which are seen but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are for a time but the things which are not seen are eternal
 for we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in heaven
 for in this we are crying in weariness greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven
 so that our spirits may not be unclothed
 for truly we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness for the weight of care which is on us not because we are desiring to be free from the body but so that we may have our new body and death may be overcome by life
 now he who has made us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a witness of what is to come
 so then we are ever without fear and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the lord
  for we are walking by faith not by seeing 
 we are without fear desiring to be free from the body and to be with the lord
 for this reason we make it our purpose in the body or away from it to be well pleasing to him
