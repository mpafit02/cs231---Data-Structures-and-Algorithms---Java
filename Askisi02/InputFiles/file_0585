 and the amorite and the canaanite and the girgashite and the jebusite
 now sarai abrams wife had given him no children and she had a servant a woman of egypt whose name was hagar
 and sarai said to abram see the lord has not let me have children go in to my servant for i may get a family through her and abram did as sarai said
 so after abram had been living for ten years in the land of canaan sarai took hagar her egyptian servant and gave her to abram for his wife
 and he went in to hagar and she became with child and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for her masters wife
 and sarai said to abram may my wrong be on you i gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for me may the lord be judge between you and me
 and abram said the woman is in your power do with her whatever seems good to you and sarai was cruel to her so that she went running away from her
 and an angel of the lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land by the fountain on the way to shur
 and he said hagar sarais servant where have you come from and where are you going and she said i am running away from sarai my masters wife
 and the angel said to her go back and put yourself under her authority
 and the angel of the lord said your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered
 and the angel of the lord said see you are with child and will give birth to a son to whom you will give the name ishmael because the ears of the lord were open to your sorrow
 and he will be like a mountain ass among men his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he will keep his place against all his brothers
 and to the lord who was talking with her she gave this name you are a god who is seen for she said have i not even here in the waste land had a vision of god and am still living
 so that fountain was named fountain of life and vision it is between kadesh and bered
 and hagar gave birth to a child the son of abram to whom abram gave the name of ishmael
 abram was eighty six years old when hagar gave birth to ishmael
 when abram was ninety nine years old the lord came to him and said i am god ruler of all go in my ways and be upright in all things
 and i will make an agreement between you and me and your offspring will be greatly increased
 and abram went down on his face on the earth and the lord god went on talking with him and said
 as for me my agreement is made with you and you will be the father of nations without end
 no longer will your name be abram but abraham for i have made you the father of a number of nations
 i will make you very fertile so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
 and i will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations an eternal agreement to be a god to you and to your seed after you
 and to you and to your seed after you i will give the land in which you are living all the land of canaan for an eternal heritage and i will be their god
 and god said to abraham on your side you are to keep the agreement you and your seed after you through all generations
 and this is the agreement which you are to keep with me you and your seed after you every male among you is to undergo circumcision
 in the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it as a mark of the agreement between me and you
 every male among you from one generation to another is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old with every servant whose birth takes place in your house or for whom you gave money to someone of another country and not of your seed
 he who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price all are to undergo circumcision so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh an agreement for all time
