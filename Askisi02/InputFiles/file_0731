 truly there is no building up of what is pulled down by him when a man is shut up by him no one may let him loose
 truly he keeps back the waters and they are dry he sends them out and the earth is overturned
 with him are strength and wise designs he who is guided into error together with his guide are in his hands
 he takes away the wisdom of the wise guides and makes judges foolish
 he undoes the chains of kings and puts his band on them
 he makes priests prisoners overturning those in safe positions
 he makes the words of responsible persons without effect and takes away the good sense of the old
 he puts shame on chiefs and takes away the power of the strong
 uncovering deep things out of the dark and making the deep shade bright
 increasing nations and sending destruction on them making wide the lands of peoples and then giving them up
 he takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way
 they go feeling about in the dark without light wandering without help like those overcome with wine
 truly my eye has seen all this word of it has come to my ear and i have knowledge of it
 the same things are in my mind as in yours i am equal to you
 but i would have talk with the ruler of all and my desire is to have an argument with god
 but you put a false face on things all your attempts to put things right are of no value
 if only you would keep quiet it would be a sign of wisdom 
 give ear to the argument of my mouth and take note of the words of my lips
 will you say in gods name what is not right and put false words into his mouth
 will you have respect for gods person in this cause and put yourselves forward as his supporters
 will it be good for you to be searched out by him or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man
 he will certainly put you right if you have respect for persons in secret
 will not his glory put you in fear so that your hearts will be overcome before him
 your wise sayings are only dust and your strong places are only earth
 keep quiet and let me say what is in my mind whatever may come to me
 i will take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand
 truly he will put an end to me i have no hope but i will not give way in argument before him
 and that will be my salvation for an evil doer would not come before him
 give ear with care to my words and keep what i say in your minds
 see now i have put my cause in order and i am certain that i will be seen to be right
