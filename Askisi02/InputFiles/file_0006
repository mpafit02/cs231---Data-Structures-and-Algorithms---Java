 so then my brothers let it be your chief desire to be prophets but let no one be stopped from using tongues
 let all things be done in the right and ordered way
 now i am going to make clear to you my brothers what the good news was which i gave to you and which you took and on which your faith is based
 by which you have salvation that is to say the form in which it was given to you if it is fixed in your minds and if your faith in it is not without effect
 for i gave to you first of all what was handed down to me how christ underwent death for our sins as it says in the writings
 and he was put in the place of the dead and on the third day he came back from the dead as it says in the writings
 and he was seen by cephas then by the twelve
 then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time most of whom are still living but some are sleeping
 then he was seen by james then by all the apostles
 and last of all as by one whose birth was out of the right time he was seen by me
 for i am the least of the apostles having no right to be named an apostle because of my cruel attacks on the church of god
 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing for i did more work than all of them though not i but the grace of god which was with me
 if then it is i who am the preacher or they this is our word and to this you have given your faith
 now if the good news says that christ came back from the dead how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead
 but if there is no coming back from the dead then christ has not come back from the dead
 and if christ did not come again from the dead then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect
 yes and we are seen to be false witnesses of god because we gave witness of god that by his power christ came again from the dead which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead
 for if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again then christ has not come to life again
 and if that is so your faith is of no effect you are still in your sins
 and in addition the dead in christ have gone to destruction
 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most unhappy
 but now christ has truly come back from the dead the first fruits of those who are sleeping
 for as by man came death so by man there is a coming back from the dead
 for as in adam death comes to all so in christ will all come back to life
 but every man in his right order christ the first fruits then those who are christs at his coming
 then comes the end when he will give up the kingdom to god even the father when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power
 for his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet
 the last power to come to an end is death
 for as it says he has put all things under his feet but when he says all things are put under him it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him
 and when all things have been put under him then will the son himself be under him who put all things under him so that god may be all in all
