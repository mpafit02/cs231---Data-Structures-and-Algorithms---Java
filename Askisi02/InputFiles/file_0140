 the men of nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of jonah but now something greater than jonah is here
 no man when the light has been lighted puts it in a secret place or under a vessel but on its table so that those who come in may see the light
 the light of the body is the eye when your eye is true all your body is full of light but when it is evil your body is dark
 so take care that the light which is in you is not dark
 if then all your body is light with no part of it dark it will be completely full of light as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light
 now while he was talking a pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him and he went in and took his seat at the meal
 and when the pharisee saw it he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself
 and the lord said to him you pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean but inside you are thieves and full of evil
 o you foolish ones  did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside
 but if you give to the poor such things as you are able then all things are clean to you
 but a curse is on you pharisees  for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant and give no thought to right and the love of god but it is right for you to do these things and not let the others be undone
 a curse is on you pharisees  for your desires are for the most important seats in the synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market place
 a curse is on you  for you are like the resting places of dead men which are not seen and men go walking over them without knowledge of it
 and one of the teachers of the law answering said to him master in saying this you give a bad name to us as to them
 and he said a curse is on you teachers of the law  for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them
 a curse is on you  for you make resting places for the bodies of the prophets but your fathers put them to death
 so you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers for they put them to death and you make their last resting places
 for this reason the wisdom of god has said i will send them prophets and teachers and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains
 so that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days
 from the blood of abel to the blood of zachariah who was put to death between the altar and the temple yes i say to you it will come on this generation
 a curse is on you teachers of the law  for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not go in yourselves and you got in the way of those who were going in
 and when he had come out of that place the scribes and the pharisees came round him angrily questioning him about more things
 and watching him for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him
 at that time when thousands of the people had come together in such numbers that they were crushing one another he said first to his disciples have nothing to do with the leaven of the pharisees which is deceit
 but nothing is covered up which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
 so whatever you have said in the dark will come to mens hearing in the light and what you have said secretly inside the house will be made public from the house tops
 and i say to you my friends have no fear of those who may put the body to death and are able to do no more than that
 but i will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear of him who after death has power to send you to hell yes truly i say have fear of him
 are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings and god has every one of them in mind
 but even the hairs of your head are numbered have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
