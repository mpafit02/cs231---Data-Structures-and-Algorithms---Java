 and the lord will send you wandering among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge
 and even among these nations there will be no peace for you and no rest for your feet but the lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul
 your very life will be hanging in doubt before you and day and night will be dark with fears and nothing in life will be certain
 in the morning you will say if only it was evening  and at evening you will say if only morning would come  because of the fear in your hearts and the things which your eyes will see
 and the lord will take you back to egypt again in ships by the way of which i said to you you will never see it again there you will be offering yourselves as men servants and women servants to your haters for a price and no man will take you
 these are the words of the agreement which moses was ordered by the lord to make with the children of israel in the land of moab in addition to the agreement which he made with them in horeb
 and moses said in the hearing of all israel you have seen all the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
 the great tests which your eyes saw and the signs and wonders
 but even to this day the lord has not given you a mind open to knowledge or seeing eyes or hearing ears
 for forty years i have been your guide through the waste land your clothing has not become old on your backs or your shoes on your feet
 you have had no bread or wine or strong drink so that you might see that i am the lord your god
 when you came to this place sihon king of heshbon and og king of bashan came out to make war against us and we overcame them
 and we took their land and gave it to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh for their heritage
 so keep the words of this agreement and do them so that it may be well for you in everything you do
 you have come here today all of you before the lord your god the heads of your tribes the overseers and those who are in authority over you with all the men of israel
 and your little ones your wives and the men of other lands who are with you in your tents down to the wood cutter and the servant who gets water for you
 with the purpose of taking part in the agreement of the lord your god and his oath which he makes with you today
 and so that he may make you his people today and be your god as he has said to you and as he made an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
 and not with you only do i make this agreement and this oath
 but with everyone who is here with us today before the lord our god as well as with those who are not here
  for you have in mind how we were living in the land of egypt and how we came through all the nations which were on your way
 and you have seen their disgusting doings and the images of wood and stone and silver and gold which were among them 
 so that there may not be among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away from the lord our god today to go after other gods and give them worship or any root among you whose fruit is poison and bitter sorrow
 if such a man hearing the words of this oath takes comfort in the thought that he will have peace even if he goes on in the pride of his heart taking whatever chance may give him
 the lord will have no mercy on him but the wrath of the lord will be burning against that man and all the curses recorded in this book will be waiting for him and the lord will take away his name completely from the earth
 he will be marked out by the lord from all the tribes of israel for an evil fate in keeping with all the curses of the agreement recorded in this book of the law
 and future generations your children coming after you and travellers from far countries will say when they see the punishments of that land and the diseases which the lord has sent on it
 and that all the land is a salt and smoking waste not planted or giving fruit or clothed with grass but wasted like sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboiim on which the lord sent destruction in the heat of his wrath
 truly all the nations will say why has the lord done so to this land what is the reason for this great and burning wrath
 then men will say because they gave up the agreement of the lord the god of their fathers which he made with them when he took them out of the land of egypt
