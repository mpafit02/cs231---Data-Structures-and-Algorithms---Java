 and every spirit which does not say this is not from god this is the spirit of antichrist of which you have had word and it is in the world even now
 you are of god my little children and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world
 they are of the world so their talk is the worlds talk and the world gives ear to them
 we are of god he who has the knowledge of god gives ear to us he who is not of god does not give ear to us by this we may see which is the true spirit and which is the spirit of error
 my loved ones let us have love for one another because love is of god and everyone who has love is a child of god and has knowledge of god
 he who has no love has no knowledge of god because god is love
 and the love of god was made clear to us when he sent his only son into the world so that we might have life through him
 and this is love not that we had love for god but that he had love for us and sent his son to be an offering for our sins
 my loved ones if god had such love for us it is right for us to have love for one another
 no man has ever seen god if we have love for one another god is in us and his love is made complete in us
 and his spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us
 and we have seen and give witness that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
 everyone who says openly that jesus is the son of god has god in him and is in god
 and we have seen and had faith in the love which god has for us god is love and everyone who has love is in god and god is in him
 in this way love is made complete in us so that we may be without fear on the day of judging because as he is so are we in this world
 there is no fear in love true love has no room for fear because where fear is there is pain and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love
 we have the power of loving because he first had love for us
 if a man says i have love for god and has hate for his brother his words are false for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen able to have love for god whom he has not seen
 and this is the word which we have from him that he who has love for god is to have the same love for his brother
 everyone who has faith that jesus is the christ is a child of god and everyone who has love for the father has love for his child
 in this way we are certain that we have love for the children of god when we have love for god and keep his laws
 for loving god is keeping his laws and his laws are not hard
 anything which comes from god is able to overcome the world and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith
 who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that jesus is the son of god
 this is he who came by water and by blood jesus christ not by water only but by water and by blood
 and the spirit is the witness because the spirit is true
 there are three witnesses the spirit the water and the blood and all three are in agreement
 if we take the witness of men to be true the witness of god is greater because this is the witness which god has given about his son
 he who has faith in the son of god has the witness in himself he who has not faith in god makes him false because he has not faith in the witness which god has given about his son
 and his witness is this that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son
