 jesus made answer and said do not say things against me one to another
 no man is able to come to me if the father who sent me does not give him the desire to come and i will take him up from the dead on the last day
 the writings of the prophets say and they will all have teaching from god everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the father comes to me
 not that anyone has ever seen the father only he who is from god he has seen the father
 truly i say to you he who has faith in me has eternal life
 i am the bread of life
 your fathers took the manna in the waste land  and they are dead
 the bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death
 i am the living bread which has come from heaven if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever and more than this the bread which i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
 then the jews had an angry discussion among themselves saying how is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food
 then jesus said to them truly i say to you if you do not take the flesh of the son of man for food and if you do not take his blood for drink you have no life in you
 he who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life and i will take him up from the dead at the last day
 my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
 he who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and i in him
 as the living father has sent me and i have life because of the father even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me
 this is the bread which has come down from heaven it is not like the food which your fathers had they took of the manna and are dead but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever
 jesus said these things in the synagogue while he was teaching at capernaum
 then hearing this a number of his disciples said this is a hard saying who is able to take in such teaching
 when jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said he said to them does this give you trouble
 what then will you say if you see the son of man going up to where he was before
 the spirit is the life giver the flesh is of no value the words which i have said to you are spirit and they are life
 but still some of you have no faith for it was clear to jesus from the first who they were who had no faith and who it was who would be false to him
 and he said this is why i said to you no man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the father
 because of what he said a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him
 so jesus said to the twelve have you a desire to go away
 then simon peter gave this answer lord to whom are we to go you have the words of eternal life
 and we have faith and are certain that you are the holy one of god
 then jesus said did i not make a selection of you the twelve and one of you is a son of the evil one
 he was talking of judas the son of simon iscariot it was he who was to be false to jesus  one of the twelve
 after this jesus went from place to place in galilee he did not go about in judaea because the jews were looking for a chance to put him to death
