 and to have knowledge of the love of christ which is outside all knowledge so that you may be made complete as god himself is complete
 now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts through the power which is working in us
 to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations for ever and ever so be it
 i then the prisoner in the lord make this request from my heart that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which gods purpose has given you
 with all gentle and quiet behaviour taking whatever comes putting up with one another in love
 taking care to keep the harmony of the spirit in the yoke of peace
 there is one body and one spirit even as you have been marked out by god in the one hope of his purpose for you
 one lord one faith one baptism
 one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
 but to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of christ
 for this reason he says he went up on high taking his prisoners with him and gave freely to men
  now this he went up what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth
 he who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete 
 and he gave some as apostles and some prophets and some preachers of the good news and some to give care and teaching
 for the training of the saints as servants in the church for the building up of the body of christ
 till we all come to the harmony of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to full growth to the full measure of christ
 so that we may be no longer children sent this way and that turned about by every wind of teaching by the twisting and tricks of men by the deceits of error
 but saying true words in love may come to full growth in him who is the head even christ
 through whom all the body being rightly formed and united together by the full working of every part is increased to the building up of itself in love
 this i say then and give witness in the lord that you are to go no longer in the way of the gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit
 whose thoughts are dark to whom the life of god is strange because they are without knowledge and their hearts have been made hard
 who having no more power of feeling have given themselves up to evil passions to do all unclean things with overmuch desire
 for this was not the teaching of christ which was given to you
 if in fact you gave ear to him and were given teaching in him even as what is true is made clear in jesus
 that you are to put away in relation to your earlier way of life the old man which has become evil by love of deceit
 and be made new in the spirit of your mind
 and put on the new man to which god has given life in righteousness and a true and holy way of living
 and so putting away false words let everyone say what is true to his neighbour for we are parts one of another
 be angry without doing wrong let not the sun go down on your wrath
 and do not give way to the evil one
