 i was quick to do your orders and let no time be wasted
 the cords of evil doers are round me but i have kept in mind your law
 in the middle of the night i will get up to give you praise because of all your right decisions
 i keep company with all your worshippers and those who have your orders in their memory
 the earth o lord is full of your mercy give me knowledge of your rules
 &ltteth&gt you have done good to your servant o lord in keeping with your word
 give me knowledge and good sense for i have put my faith in your teachings
 before i was in trouble i went out of the way but now i keep your word
 you are good and your works are good give me knowledge of your rules
 the men of pride have said false things about me but i will keep your orders in my heart
 their hearts are shut up with fat but my delight is in your law
 it is good for me to have been through trouble so that i might come to the knowledge of your rules
 the law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver
 &ltjod&gt your hands have made me and given me form give me wisdom so that i may have knowledge of your teaching
 your worshippers will see me and be glad because my hope has been in your word
 i have seen o lord that your decisions are right and that in unchanging faith you have sent trouble on me
 let your mercy now be my comfort as you have said to your servant
 let your gentle mercies come to me so that i may have life for your law is my delight
 let the men of pride be shamed because they have falsely given decision against me but i will give thought to your orders
 let your worshippers be turned to me and those who have knowledge of your words
 let all my heart be given to your orders so that i may not be put to shame
 &ltcaph&gt my soul is wasted with desire for your salvation but i have hope in your word
 my eyes are full of weariness with searching for your word saying when will you give me comfort
 for i have become like a wine skin black with smoke but i still keep the memory of your rules
 how short is the life of your servant  when will you give your decision against those who are attacking me
 the men of pride who are turned away from your law have put nets for me
 all your teachings are certain they go after me with evil design give me your help
 they had almost put an end to me on earth but i did not give up your orders
 give me life in your mercy so that i may be ruled by the unchanging word of your mouth
 &ltlamed&gt for ever o lord your word is fixed in heaven
