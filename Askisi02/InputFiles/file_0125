 now this is the second sign which jesus did after he had come out of judaea into galilee
 after these things there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
 now in jerusalem near the sheep market there is a public bath which in hebrew is named beth zatha it has five doorways
 in these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases some unable to see some without the power of walking some with wasted bodies
   
 one man was there who had been ill for thirty eight years
 when jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition and so he said to the man is it your desire to get well
 the ill man said in answer sir i have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving and while i am on the way down some other person gets in before me
 jesus said to him get up take your bed and go
 and the man became well straight away and took up his bed and went now that day was the sabbath
 so the jews said to the man who had been made well it is the sabbath and it is against the law for you to take up your bed
 he said to them but he who made me well said to me take up your bed and go
 then they put to him the question who is the man who said to you take it up and go
 now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place
 after a time jesus came across him in the temple and said to him see you are well and strong do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you
 the man went away and said to the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
 and for this reason the jews were turned against jesus because he was doing these things on the sabbath
 but his answer was my father is still working even now and so i am working
 for this cause the jews had an even greater desire to put jesus to death because not only did he not keep the sabbath but he said god was his father so making himself equal with god
 so jesus made answer and said truly i say to you the son is not able to do anything himself he is able to do only what he sees the father doing whatever the father does the son does it in the same way
 for the father has love for the son and lets him see everything which he does and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder
 in the same way as the father gives life to the dead even so the son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it
 the father is not the judge of men but he has given all decisions into the hands of the son
 so that all men may give honour to the son even as they give honour to the father he who gives no honour to the son gives no honour to the father who sent him
 truly i say to you the man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me has eternal life he will not be judged but has come from death into life
 truly i say to you the time is coming it has even now come when the voice of the son of god will come to the ears of the dead and those hearing it will have life
 for even as the father has life in himself so he has given to the son to have life in himself
 and he has given him authority to be judge because he is the son of man
 do not be surprised at this for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead
 and they will come out those who have done good into the new life and those who have done evil to be judged
