 and after the seven days the waters came over all the earth
 in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through and the windows of heaven were open
 and rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights
 on the same day noah with shem ham and japheth his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark
 and with them every sort of beast and cattle and every sort of thing which goes on the earth and every sort of bird
 they went with noah into the ark two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life
 male and female of all flesh went in as god had said and the ark was shut by the lord
 and for forty days the waters were over all the earth and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth
 and the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth and the ark was resting on the face of the waters
 and the waters overcame everything on the earth and all the mountains under heaven were covered
 the waters went fifteen cubits higher till all the mountains were covered
 and destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth and every man
 everything on the dry land in which was the breath of life came to its end
 every living thing on the face of all the earth man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth and birds of the air came to destruction only noah and those who were with him in the ark were kept from death
 and the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days
 and god kept noah in mind and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark and god sent a wind over the earth and the waters went down
 and the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut and the rain from heaven was stopped
 and the waters went slowly back from the earth and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower
 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of ararat
 and still the waters went on falling till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen
 then after forty days through the open window of the ark which he had made
 noah sent out a raven which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth
 and he sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth
 but the dove saw no resting place for her foot and came back to the ark for the waters were still over all the earth and he put out his hand and took her into the ark
 and after waiting another seven days he sent the dove out again
 and the dove came back at evening and in her mouth was an olive leaf broken off so noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth
 and after seven days more he sent the dove out again but she did not come back to him
 and in the six hundred and first year on the first day of the first month the waters were dry on the earth and noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry
 and on the twenty seventh day of the second month the earth was dry
 and god said to noah
