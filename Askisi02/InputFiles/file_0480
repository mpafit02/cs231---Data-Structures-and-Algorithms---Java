 i gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things and to the discovery that sin is foolish and that to be foolish is to be without ones senses
 and i saw a thing more bitter than death even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets and whose hands are as bands he with whom god is pleased will get free from her but the sinner will be taken by her
 look  this i have seen said the preacher taking one thing after another to get the true account
 for which my soul is still searching but i have it not one man among a thousand have i seen but a woman among all these i have not seen
 this only have i seen that god made men upright but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions
 who is like the wise man and to whom is the sense of anything clear a mans wisdom makes his face shining and his hard face will be changed
 i say to you keep the kings law from respect for the oath of god
 be not quick to go from before him be not fixed in an evil design because he does whatever is pleasing to him
 the word of a king has authority and who may say to him what is this you are doing
 whoever keeps the law will come to no evil and a wise mans heart has knowledge of time and of decision
 for every purpose there is a time and a decision because the sorrow of man is great in him
 no one is certain what is to be and who is able to say to him when it will be
 no man has authority over the wind to keep the wind or is ruler over the day of his death in war no mans time is free and evil will not keep the sinner safe
 all this have i seen and have given my heart to all the work which is done under the sun there is a time when man has power over man for his destruction
 and then i saw evil men put to rest taken even from the holy place and they went about and were praised in the town because of what they had done this again is to no purpose
 because punishment for an evil work comes not quickly the minds of the sons of men are fully given to doing evil
 though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his life is long i am certain that it will be well for those who go in fear of god and are in fear before him
 but it will not be well for the evil doer he will not make his days long like a shade because he has no fear before god
 there is a thing which is to no purpose done on the earth that there are good men to whom is given the same punishment as those who are evil and there are evil men who get the reward of the good i say that this again is to no purpose
 so i gave praise to joy because there is nothing better for a man to do under the sun than to take meat and drink and be happy for that will be with him in his work all the days of his life which god gives him under the sun
 when i gave my mind to the knowledge of wisdom and to seeing the business which is done on the earth  and there are those whose eyes see not sleep by day or by night 
 then i saw all the work of god and that man may not get knowledge of the work which is done under the sun because if a man gives hard work to the search he will not get knowledge and even if the wise man seems to be coming to the end of his search still he will be without knowledge
 all this i took to heart and my heart saw it all that the upright and the wise and their works are in the hand of god and men may not be certain if it will be love or hate all is to no purpose before them
 because to all there is one event to the upright man and to the evil to the clean and to the unclean to him who makes an offering and to him who makes no offering as is the good so is the sinner he who takes an oath is as he who has fear of it
 this is evil in all things which are done under the sun that there is one fate for all and the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil while they have life their hearts are foolish and after that  to the dead
 for him who is joined to all the living there is hope a living dog is better than a dead lion
 the living are conscious that death will come to them but the dead are not conscious of anything and they no longer have a reward because there is no memory of them
 their love and their hate and their envy are now ended and they have no longer a part for ever in anything which is done under the sun
 come take your bread with joy and your wine with a glad heart god has taken pleasure in your works
 let your clothing be white at all times and let not your head be without oil
