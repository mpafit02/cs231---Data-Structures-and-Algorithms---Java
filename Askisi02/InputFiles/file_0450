 and when he has taken his place on the seat of his kingdom he is to make in a book a copy of this law from that which the priests the levites have in their care
 and it is to be with him for his reading all the days of his life so that he may be trained in the fear of the lord his god to keep and do all the words of this teaching and these laws
 so that his heart may not be lifted up over his countrymen and he may not be turned away from the orders to one side or the other but that his life and the lives of his children may be long in his kingdom in israel
 the priests the levites that is all the tribe of levi will have no part or heritage with israel their food and their heritage will be the offerings of the lord made by fire
 and they will have no heritage among their countrymen the lord is their heritage as he has said to them
 and this is to be the priests right those who make an offering of a sheep or an ox are to give to the priest the top part of the leg and the two sides of the head and the stomach
 and in addition you are to give him the first of your grain and wine and oil and the first wool cut from your sheep
 for he and his sons after him for ever have been marked out by the lord your god from all your tribes to do the work of priests in the name of the lord
 and if a levite moved by a strong desire comes from any town in all israel where he is living to the place marked out by the lord
 then he will do the work of a priest in the name of the lord his god with all his brothers the levites who are there before the lord
 his food will be the same as theirs in addition to what has come to him as the price of his property
 when you have come into the land which the lord your god is giving you do not take as your example the disgusting ways of those nations
 let there not be seen among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter go through the fire or anyone using secret arts or a maker of strange sounds or a reader of signs or any wonder worker
 or anyone using secret force on people or putting questions to a spirit or having secret knowledge or going to the dead for directions
 for all who do such things are disgusting to the lord and because of these disgusting things the lord your god is driving them out before you
 you are to be upright in heart before the lord your god
 for these nations whose land you are taking give attention to readers of signs and to those using secret arts but the lord your god will not let you do so
 the lord your god will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to him
 in answer to the request you made to the lord your god in horeb on the day of the great meeting when you said let not the voice of the lord my god come to my ears again and let me not see this great fire any more or death will overtake me
 then the lord said to me what they have said is well said
 i will give them a prophet from among themselves like you and i will put my words in his mouth and he will say to them whatever i give him orders to say
 and whoever does not give ear to my words which he will say in my name will be responsible to me
 but the prophet who takes it on himself to say words in my name which i have not given him orders to say or who says anything in the name of other gods will come to his death
 and if you say in your hearts how are we to be certain that the word does not come from the lord
 when a prophet makes a statement in the name of the lord if what he says does not take place and his words do not come true then his word is not the word of the lord the words of the prophet were said in the pride of his heart and you are to have no fear of him
 when the nations whose land the lord your god is giving you have been cut off by him and you have taken their place and are living in their towns and in their houses
 you are to have three towns marked out in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 you are to make ready a way and see that the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage is marked out into three parts to which any taker of life may go in flight
 this is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate
 for example if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree the head of the axe comes off and falling on to his neighbour gives him a wound causing his death then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe
