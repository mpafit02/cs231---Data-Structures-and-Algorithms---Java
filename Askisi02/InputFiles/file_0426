 and i took you up out of the land of egypt guiding you for forty years in the waste land so that you might take for your heritage the land of the amorite
 and some of your sons i made prophets and some of your young men i made separate for myself is it not even so o children of israel says the lord
 but to those who were separate you gave wine for drink and to the prophets you said be prophets no longer
 see i am crushing you down as one is crushed under a cart full of grain
 and flight will be impossible for the quick footed and the force of the strong will become feeble and the man of war will not get away safely
 and the bowman will not keep his place he who is quick footed will not get away safely and the horseman will not keep his life
 and he who is without fear among the fighting men will go in flight without his clothing in that day says the lord
 give ear to this word which the lord has said against you o children of israel against all the family which i took up out of the land of egypt saying
 you only of all the families of the earth have i taken care of for this reason i will send punishment on you for all your sins
 is it possible for two to go walking together if not by agreement
 will a lion give his loud cry in the woodland when no food is there will the voice of the young lion be sounding from his hole if he has taken nothing
 is it possible for a bird to be taken in a net on the earth where no net has been put for him will the net come up from the earth if it has taken nothing at all
 if the horn is sounded in the town will the people not be full of fear will evil come on a town if the lord has not done it
 certainly the lord will do nothing without making clear his secret to his servants the prophets
 the cry of the lion is sounding who will not have fear the lord god has said the word is it possible for the prophet to keep quiet
 give out the news in the great houses of assyria and in the land of egypt and say come together on the mountains of samaria and see what great outcries are there and what cruel acts are done in it
 for they have no knowledge of how to do what is right says the lord who are storing up violent acts and destruction in their great houses
 for this reason says the lord an attacker will come shutting in the land on every side and your strength will come down and your great houses will be made waste
 these are the words of the lord as the keeper of sheep takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs or part of an ear so will the children of israel be made safe who are resting in samaria on seats of honour or on the silk cushions of a bed
 give ear now and give witness against the family of jacob says the lord god the god of armies
 for in the day when i give israel punishment for his sins i will send punishment on the altars of beth el and the horns of the altar will be cut off and come down to the earth
 and i will send destruction on the winter house with the summer house the ivory houses will be falling down and the great houses will come to an end says the lord
 give ear to this word you cows of bashan who are in the hill of samaria by whom the poor are kept down and those in need are crushed who say to their lords get out the wine and give us drink
 the lord god has taken an oath by his holy name that the days are coming when they will take you away with hooks and the rest of you with fish hooks
 and you will go out through the broken places every one going straight before her and you will be sent into harmon says the lord
 come to beth el and do evil to gilgal increasing the number of your sins come with your offerings every morning and your tenths every three days
 let that which is leavened be burned as a praise offering let the news of your free offerings be given out publicly for this is pleasing to you o children of israel says the lord
 but in all your towns i have kept food from your teeth and in all your places there has been need of bread and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 and i have kept back the rain from you when it was still three months before the grain cutting i sent rain on one town and kept it back from another one part was rained on and the part where there was no rain became a waste
 so two or three towns went wandering to one town looking for water and did not get enough and still you have not come back to me says the lord
