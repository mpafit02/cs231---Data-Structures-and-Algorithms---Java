 it is eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir to kadesh barnea
 now in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month moses gave to the children of israel all the orders which the lord had given him for them
 after he had overcome sihon king of the amorites ruling in heshbon and og king of bashan ruling in ashtaroth at edrei
 on the far side of jordan in the land of moab moses gave the people this law saying
 the lord our god said to us in horeb you have been long enough in this mountain
 make a move now and go on your way into the hill country of the amorites and the places near it in the arabah and the hill country and in the lowlands and in the south and by the seaside all the land of the canaanites and lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates
 see all the land is before you go in and take for yourselves the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob and to their seed after them
 at that time i said to you i am not able to undertake the care of you by myself
 the lord your god has given you increase and now you are like the stars of heaven in number
 may the lord the god of your fathers make you a thousand times greater in number than you are and give you his blessing as he has said 
 how is it possible for me by myself to be responsible for you and undertake the weight of all your troubles and your arguments
 take for yourselves men who are wise far seeing and respected among you from your tribes and i will make them rulers over you
 and you made answer and said to me it is good for us to do as you say
 so i took the heads of your tribes wise men and respected and made them rulers over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and overseers of your tribes
 and at that time i gave orders to your judges saying let all questions between your brothers come before you for hearing and give decisions uprightly between a man and his brother or one from another nation who is with him
 in judging do not let a mans position have any weight with you give hearing equally to small and great have no fear of any man for it is god who is judge and any cause in which you are not able to give a decision you are to put before me and i will give it a hearing
 and at that time i gave you all the orders which you were to do
 then we went on from horeb through all that great and cruel waste which you saw on our way to the hill country of the amorites as the lord gave us orders and we came to kadesh barnea
 and i said to you you have come to the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us
 see now the lord your god has put the land into your hands go up and take it as the lord the god of your fathers has said to you have no fear and do not be troubled
 and you came near to me every one of you and said let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come
 and what you said seemed good to me and i took twelve men from among you one from every tribe
 and they went up into the hill country and came to the valley of eshcol and saw what was there
 and taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land they came down again to us and gave us their account saying it is a good land which the lord our god is giving us
 but going against the order of the lord your god you would not go up
 and you made an angry outcry in your tents and said in his hate for us the lord has taken us out of the land of egypt to give us up into the hands of the amorites for our destruction
 where are we going up our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying the people are greater and taller than we are and the towns are great and walled up to heaven and more than this we have seen the sons of the anakim there
 then i said to you have no fear of them
 the lord your god who goes before you will be fighting for you and will do such wonders as he did for you in egypt before your eyes
 and in the waste land where you have seen how the lord was supporting you as a man does his son in all your journeying till you came to this place
