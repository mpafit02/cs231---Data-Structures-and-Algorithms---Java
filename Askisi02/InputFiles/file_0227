 and if you say good day to your brothers only what do you do more than others do not even the gentiles the same
 be then complete in righteousness even as your father in heaven is complete
 take care not to do your good works before men to be seen by them or you will have no reward from your father in heaven
 when then you give money to the poor do not make a noise about it as the false hearted men do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may have glory from men truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you give money let not your left hand see what your right hand does
 so that your giving may be in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 and when you make your prayers be not like the false hearted men who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you make your prayer go into your private room and shutting the door say a prayer to your father in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 and in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again as the gentiles do for they have the idea that god will give attention to them because of the number of their words
 so be not like them because your father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him
 let this then be your prayer our father in heaven may your name be kept holy
 let your kingdom come let your pleasure be done as in heaven so on earth
 give us this day bread for our needs
 and make us free of our debts as we have made those free who are in debt to us
 and let us not be put to the test but keep us safe from the evil one
 for if you let men have forgiveness for their sins you will have forgiveness from your father in heaven
 but if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins you will not have forgiveness from your father for your sins
 and when you go without food be not sad faced as the false hearted are for they go about with changed looks so that men may see that they are going without food truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you go without food put oil on your head and make your face clean
 so that no one may see that you are going without food but your father in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather and where thieves may come in by force and take it away
 but make a store for yourselves in heaven where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away
 for where your wealth is there will your heart be
 the light of the body is the eye if then your eye is true all your body will be full of light
 but if your eye is evil all your body will be dark if then the light which is in you is dark how dark it will be 
 no man is able to be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other you may not be servants of god and of wealth
 so i say to you take no thought for your life about food or drink or about clothing for your body is not life more than food and the body more than its clothing
 see the birds of heaven they do not put seeds in the earth they do not get in grain or put it in store houses and your father in heaven gives them food are you not of much more value than they
 and which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller
 and why are you troubled about clothing see the flowers of the field how they come up they do no work they make no thread
