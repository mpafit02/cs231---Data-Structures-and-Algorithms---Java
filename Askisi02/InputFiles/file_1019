 who will give me help against the sinners and who will be my support against the workers of evil
 if the lord had not been my helper my soul would quickly have gone down into death
 if i say my foot is slipping your mercy o lord is my support
 among all my troubled thoughts your comforts are the delight of my soul
 what part with you has the seat of sin which makes evil into a law
 they are banded together against the soul of the upright to give decisions against those who have done no wrong
 but the lord is my safe resting place my god is the rock where i am safe
 and he has made their evil designs come back on themselves cutting them off in their sin the lord our god will put an end to them
 o come let us make songs to the lord sending up glad voices to the rock of our salvation
 let us come before his face with praises and make melody with holy songs
 for the lord is a great god and a great king over all gods
 the deep places of the earth are in his hand and the tops of the mountains are his
 the sea is his and he made it and the dry land was formed by his hands
 o come let us give worship falling down on our knees before the lord our maker
 for he is our god and we are the people to whom he gives food and the sheep of his flock today if you would only give ear to his voice 
 let not your hearts be hard as at meribah as in the day of massah in the waste land
 when your fathers put me to the test and saw my power and my work
 for forty years i was angry with this generation and said they are a people whose hearts are turned away from me for they have no knowledge of my ways
 and i made an oath in my wrath that they might not come into my place of rest
 o make a new song to the lord let all the earth make melody to the lord
 make songs to the lord blessing his name give the good news of his salvation day by day
 make clear his glory to the nations and his wonders to all the peoples
 for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is more to be feared than all other gods
 for all the gods of the nations are false gods but the lord made the heavens
 honour and glory are before him strong and fair is his holy place
 give to the lord o you families of the peoples give to the lord glory and strength
 give to the lord the glory of his name take with you an offering and come into his house
 o give worship to the lord in holy robes be in fear before him all the earth
 say among the nations the lord is king yes the world is ordered so that it may not be moved he will be an upright judge of the peoples
 let the heavens have joy and the earth be glad let the sea be thundering with all its waters
