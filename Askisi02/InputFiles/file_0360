 and they came up against judah forcing a way into it and took away all the goods in the kings house as well as his sons and his wives so that he had no son but only jehoahaz the youngest
 and after all this the lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well
 and time went on and after two years his inside falling out because of the disease he came to his death in cruel pain and his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers
 he was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years and at his death he was not regretted they put his body into the earth in the town of david but not in the resting place of the kings
 and the people of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his place for the band of men who came with the arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death so ahaziah the son of jehoram became king
 ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for one year his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri
 he went in the ways of the family of ahab for his mother was his teacher in evil doing
 and he did evil in the eyes of the lord as the family of ahab did for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction
 acting on their suggestion he went with jehoram son of ahab king of israel to make war on hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead and joram was wounded by the bowmen
 and he went back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he was fighting against hazael king of aram and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to jezreel to see jehoram the son of ahab because he was ill
 now by the purpose of god ahaziahs journey to see jehoram was the cause of his downfall for when he came there he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi who had been marked out by the lord for the destruction of the family of ahab
 now when jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of ahab he came to the princes of judah and the sons of ahaziahs brothers the servants of ahaziah and put them to death
 and he went in search of ahaziah and when they came where he was  for he was in a secret place in samaria  they took him to jehu and put him to death then they put his body to rest in the earth for they said he is the son of jehoshaphat whose heart was true to the lord so the family of ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom
 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of judah put to death
 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king secretly took joash the son of ahaziah away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest and sister of ahaziah kept him safe from athaliah so that she did not put him to death
 and she kept him safe with her in the house of god for six years while athaliah was ruling the land
 in the seventh year jehoiada made himself strong and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham ishmael the son of jehohanan azariah the son of obed maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri
 and they went through judah getting together the levites and the heads of families in israel from all the towns of judah and they came to jerusalem
 and all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of god and he said to them truly the kings son will be king as the lord has said about the sons of david
 this is what you are to do let a third of you of the priests and levites who come in on the sabbath keep the doors
 and a third are to be stationed at the kings house and a third at the doorway of the horses while all the people are waiting in the open spaces round the house of the lord
 but let no one come into the house of the lord but only the priests and those of the levites who have work to do there they may go in for they are holy but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the lord
 and the levites are to make a circle round the king every man being armed and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out
 so the levites and all judah did as jehoiada the priest had given them orders every one took with him his men those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada had not sent away the divisions
 then jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body covers which had been king davids and which were kept in the house of god
 and he put all the people in position every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left by the altar and the house and all round the king
 then they made the kings son come out and they put the crown on his head and gave him the arm bands and made him king and jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said long life to the king
 now athaliah hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king came to the people in the house of the lord
 and looking she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway and the captains and the horns by his side and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns and the makers of melody were playing on instruments of music taking the chief part in the song of praise then athaliah violently parting her robes said broken faith broken faith 
 then jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army saying take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword for the priest said let her not be put to death in the house of the lord
