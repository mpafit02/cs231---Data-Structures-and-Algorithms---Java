 and after david had made the burned offerings and the peace offerings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the lord of armies
 and he gave to every man and woman among all the people among all the masses of israel a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes then all the people went away every man to his house
 then david came back to give a blessing to his family and michal sauls daughter came out to him and said how full of glory was the king of israel today who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame 
 and david said to michal i was dancing before the lord who put me over your father and all his sons to make me a ruler over the people of the lord over his people israel and i will go on playing before the lord
 and i will do even worse than this and make myself even lower in your eyes but the servant girls of whom you were talking will give me honour
 and michal sauls daughter had no child till the day of her death
 now when the king was living in his house and the lord had given him rest from war on every side
 the king said to nathan the prophet see now i am living in a house of cedar but the ark of god is housed inside the curtains of a tent
 and nathan said to the king go and do whatever is in your heart for the lord is with you
 now that night the word of the lord came to nathan saying
 go and say to my servant david the lord says are you to be the builder of a house a living place for me
 for from the day when i took the children of israel up out of egypt till this day i have had no house but have gone from place to place in a tent
 in all the places where i went with all the children of israel did i ever say to any of the judges of israel to whom i gave the care of my people israel why have you not made me a house of cedar
 then say these words to my servant david the lord of armies says i took you from the fields from keeping the sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people over my people israel
 and i have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and i will make your name great like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
 and i will make a resting place for my people israel planting them there so that they may be living in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first
 from the time when i put judges over my people israel and i will give you peace from all who are against you and the lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings
 and when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers i will put in your place your seed after you the offspring of your body and i will make his kingdom strong
 he will be the builder of a house for my name and i will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
 i will be to him a father and he will be to me a son if he does wrong i will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men
 but my mercy will not be taken away from him as i took it from him who was before you
 and your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever the seat of your authority will never be overturned
 so nathan gave david an account of all these words and this vision
 then david the king went in and took his seat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
 and this was only a small thing to you o lord god but your words have even been about the far off future of your servants family o lord god 
 what more may david say to you for you have knowledge of your servant o lord god
 because of your word and from your heart you have done all this great work and let your servant see it
 truly you are great o lord god there is no one like you and no other god but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
 and what other nation in the earth like your people israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people and to make a name for himself and to do great and strange things for them driving out a nation and its gods from before his people
 but you took and made strong for yourself your people israel to be your people for ever and you lord became their god
