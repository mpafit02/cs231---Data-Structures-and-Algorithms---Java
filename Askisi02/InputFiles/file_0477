 a time to take stones away and a time to get stones together a time for kissing and a time to keep from kissing
 a time for search and a time for loss a time to keep and a time to give away
 a time for undoing and a time for stitching a time for keeping quiet and a time for talk
 a time for love and a time for hate a time for war and a time for peace
 what profit has the worker in the work which he does
 i saw the work which god has put on the sons of man
 he has made everything right in its time but he has made their hearts without knowledge so that man is unable to see the works of god from the first to the last
 i am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to be glad and to do good while life is in him
 and for every man to take food and drink and have joy in all his work is a reward from god
 i am certain that whatever god does will be for ever no addition may be made to it nothing may be taken from it and god has done it so that man may be in fear before him
 whatever is has been before and what is to be is now because god makes search for the things which are past
 and again i saw under the sun in the place of the judges that evil was there and in the place of righteousness that evil was there
 i said in my heart god will be judge of the good and of the bad because a time for every purpose and for every work has been fixed by him
 i said in my heart it is because of the sons of men so that god may put them to the test and that they may see themselves as beasts
 because the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same as is the death of one so is the death of the other and all have one spirit man is not higher than the beasts because all is to no purpose
 all go to one place all are of the dust and all will be turned to dust again
 who is certain that the spirit of the sons of men goes up to heaven or that the spirit of the beasts goes down to the earth
 so i saw that there is nothing better than for a man to have joy in his work  because that is his reward who will make him see what will come after him
 and again i saw all the cruel things which are done under the sun there was the weeping of those who have evil done to them and they had no comforter and from the hands of the evil doers there went out power but they had no comforter
 so my praise was for the dead who have gone to their death more than for the living who still have life
 yes happier than the dead or the living seemed he who has not ever been who has not seen the evil which is done under the sun
 and i saw that the cause of all the work and of everything which is done well was mans envy of his neighbour this again is to no purpose and a desire for wind
 the foolish man folding his hands takes the flesh of his body for food
 one hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind
 then i came back and i saw an example of what is to no purpose under the sun
 it is one who is by himself without a second and without son or brother but there is no end to all his work and he has never enough of wealth for whom then am i working and keeping myself from pleasure this again is to no purpose and a bitter work
 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their work
 and if one has a fall the other will give him a hand but unhappy is the man who is by himself because he has no helper
 so again if two are sleeping together they are warm but how may one be warm by himself
 and two attacked by one would be safe and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken
