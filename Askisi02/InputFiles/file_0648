 for so has the lord said to me go let a watchman be placed let him give word of what he sees
 and when he sees war carriages horsemen by twos war carriages with asses war carriages with camels let him give special attention
 and the watchman gave a loud cry o my lord i am on the watchtower all day and am placed in my watch every night
 see here come war carriages with men horsemen by twos and in answer he said babylon is made low is made low and all her images are broken on the earth
 o my crushed ones the grain of my floor  i have given you the word which came to me from the lord of armies the god of israel
 the word about edom a voice comes to me from seir watchman how far gone is the night how far gone is the night
 the watchman says the morning has come but night is still to come if you have questions to put put them and come back again
 the word about arabia in the thick woods of arabia will be your nights resting place o travelling bands of dedanites 
 give water to him who is in need of water give bread o men of the land of tema to those in flight
 for they are in flight from the sharp sword and the bent bow and from the trouble of war
 for so has the lord said to me in a year by the years of a servant working for payment all the glory of kedar will come to an end
 and the rest of the bowmen the men of war of the children of kedar will be small in number for the lord the god of israel has said it
 the word about the valley of vision why have all your people gone up to the house tops
 you who are full of loud voices a town of outcries given up to joy your dead men have not been put to the sword or come to their death in war
 all your rulers  have gone in flight all your strong ones have gone far away
 for this cause i have said let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping i will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people
 for it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the lord the lord of armies in the valley of vision 
 and elam was armed with arrows and aram came on horseback and the breastplate of kir was uncovered
 and your most fertile valleys were full of war carriages and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town
 he took away the cover of judah and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods
 and you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of david and you got together the waters of the lower pool
 and you had the houses of jerusalem numbered pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger
 and you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool but you gave no thought to him who had done this and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before
 and in that day the lord the lord of armies was looking for weeping and cries of sorrow cutting off of the hair and putting on the clothing of grief
 but in place of these there was joy and delight oxen and sheep were being made ready for food there was feasting and drinking men said now is the time for food and wine for tomorrow death comes
 and the lord of armies said to me secretly truly this sin will not be taken from you till your death says the lord the lord of armies
 the lord the lord of armies says go to this person in authority this shebna who is over the house who has made himself a resting place on high cutting out a place for himself in the rock and say
 who are you and by what right have you made for yourself a resting place here
 see o strong man the lord will send you violently away gripping you with force
 twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country there you will come to your end and there will be the carriages of your pride o shame of your lords house
