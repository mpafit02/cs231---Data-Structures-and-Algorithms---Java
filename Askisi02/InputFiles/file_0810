 then zebul said to him now where is your loud talk when you said who is abimelech that we are to be his servants is this not the people whom you were rating so low go out now and make war on them
 so gaal went out at the head of the townsmen of shechem and made war on abimelech
 and abimelech went after him and he went in flight before him and a great number were falling by the sword all the way up to the town
 then abimelech went back to arumah and zebul sent gaal and his brothers away and would not let them go on living in shechem
 now the day after the people went out into the fields and news of it came to abimelech
 and he took his people separating them into three bands and was waiting secretly in the field and when he saw the people coming out of the town he went up and made an attack on them
 and abimelech with his band made a rush and took up their position at the doorway into the town and the other two bands made a rush on all those who were in the fields and overcame them
 and all that day abimelech was fighting against the town and he took it and put to death the people who were in it and had the town pulled down and covered with salt
 then all the townsmen of the tower of shechem hearing of it went into the inner room of the house of el berith
 and word was given to abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were there together
 then abimelech went up to mount zalmon with all his people and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cutting down branches of trees took them and put them on his back and he said to the people who were with him be quick and do as you have seen me do
 so all the people got branches every man cutting down a branch and they went with abimelech at their head and massing the branches against the inner room put fire to the room over them so all those who were in the tower of shechem about a thousand men and women were burned to death with it
 then abimelech went to thebez and put his army in position against thebez and took it
 but in the middle of the town there was a strong tower to which all the men and women of the town went in flight and shutting themselves in went up to the roof of the tower
 and abimelech came to the tower and made an attack on it and got near to the door of the tower for the purpose of firing it
 but a certain woman sent a great stone such as is used for crushing grain on to the head of abimelech cracking the bone
 then quickly crying out to his body servant he said to him take out your sword and put an end to me straight away so that men may not say of me his death was the work of a woman so the young man put his sword through him causing his death
 and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they went away every man to his place
 in this way abimelech was rewarded by god for the evil he had done to his father in putting his seventy brothers to death
 and god sent back on to the heads of the men of shechem all the evil they had done and the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal came on them
 see her seated by herself the town which was full of people  she who was great among the nations has become like a widow  she who was a princess among the countries has come under the yoke of forced work 
 she is sorrowing bitterly in the night and her face is wet with weeping among all her lovers she has no comforter all her friends have been false to her they have become her haters
 judah has been taken away as a prisoner because of trouble and hard work her living place is among the nations there is no rest for her all her attackers have overtaken her in a narrow place
 the ways of zion are sad because no one comes to the holy meeting all her doorways are made waste her priests are breathing out sorrow her virgins are troubled and it is bitter for her
 those who are against her have become the head everything goes well for her haters for the lord has sent sorrow on her because of the great number of her sins her young children have gone away as prisoners before the attacker
 and all her glory has gone from the daughter of zion her rulers have become like harts with no place for food and they have gone in flight without strength before the attacker
 jerusalem keeps in mind in the days of her sorrow and of her wanderings all the desired things which were hers in days gone by when her people came into the power of her hater and she had no helper her attackers saw their desire effected on her and made sport of her destruction
 great is the sin of jerusalem for this cause she has become an unclean thing all those who gave her honour are looking down on her because they have seen her shame now truly breathing out grief she is turned back
 in her skirts were her unclean ways she gave no thought to her end and her fall has been a wonder she has no comforter see her sorrow o lord for the attacker is lifted up
 the hand of her hater is stretched out over all her desired things for she has seen that the nations have come into her holy place about whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people
