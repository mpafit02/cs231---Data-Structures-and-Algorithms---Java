 but i have in some measure less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again because of the grace which was given to me by god
 to be a servant of christ jesus to the gentiles doing the work of a priest in the good news of god so that the offering of the gentiles might be pleasing to god being made holy by the holy spirit
 so i have pride in christ jesus in the things which are gods
 and i will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which christ has done by me to put the gentiles under his rule in word and in act
 by signs and wonders in the power of the holy spirit so that from jerusalem and round about as far as illyricum i have given all the good news of christ
 making it my purpose not to take the good news where christ was named so that my work might not be resting on that of others
 but as it is said in the holy writings they will see to whom the news of him had not been given and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge
 for which reason i was frequently kept from coming to you
 but now having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you
 whenever i go to spain  for it is my hope to see you on my way and to be sent on there by you if first i may in some measure have been comforted by your company   
 but now i go to jerusalem taking help for the saints
 for it has been the good pleasure of those of macedonia and achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at jerusalem
 yes it has been their good pleasure and they are in their debt for if the gentiles have had a part in the things of the spirit which were theirs it is right for them in the same way to give them help in the things of the flesh
 so when i have done this and have given them this fruit of love i will go on by you into spain
 and i am certain that when i come i will be full of the blessing of christ
 now i make request to you brothers by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit that you will be working together with me in your prayers to god for me
 so that i may be kept safe from those in judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of god and that the help which i am taking for jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints
 so that i may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of god and have rest with you
 now may the god of peace be with you all so be it
 it is my desire to say a good word for phoebe who is a servant of the church in cenchreae
 that you will take her in kindly after the way of the saints as one who is the lords and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you because she has been a help to a great number and to myself
 give my love to prisca and aquila workers with me in christ jesus
 who for my life put their necks in danger to whom not only i but all the churches of the gentiles are in debt
 and say a kind word to the church which is in their house give my love to my dear epaenetus who is the first fruit of asia to christ
 give my love to mary who gave much care to you
 give my love to andronicus and junia my relations who were in prison with me who are noted among the apostles and who were in christ before me
 give my love to ampliatus who is dear to me in the lord
 give my love to urbanus a worker in christ with us and to my dear stachys
 give my love to apelles who has the approval of christ say a kind word to those who are of the house of aristobulus
 give my love to herodion my relation say a kind word to those of the house of narcissus who are in the lord
