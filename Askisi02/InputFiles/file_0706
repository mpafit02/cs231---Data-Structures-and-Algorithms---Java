 but later they took back again the servants and the servant girls whom they had let go free and put them again under the yoke as servants and servant girls
 for this reason the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 the lord the god of israel has said i made an agreement with your fathers on the day when i took them out of egypt out of the prison house saying
 at the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a hebrew who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years you are to let him go free but your fathers gave no attention and did not give ear
 and now turning away from evil you had done what is right in my eyes giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name
 but again you have put shame on my name and you have taken back every one his man servant and his servant girl whom you had sent away free and you have put them under the yoke again to be your servants and servant girls
 and so the lord has said you have not given ear to me and undertaken publicly every man to let loose his countryman and his neighbour see i undertake to let loose against you the sword and disease and need of food and i will send you wandering among all the kingdoms of the earth
 and i will give the men who have gone against my agreement and have not given effect to the words of the agreement which they made before me when the ox was cut in two and they went between the parts of it
 the rulers of judah and the rulers of jerusalem the unsexed servants and the priests and all the people of the land who went between the parts of the ox
 even these i will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
 and zedekiah king of judah and his rulers i will give into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and into the hands of the king of babylons army which has gone away from you
 see i will give orders says the lord and make them come back to this town and they will make war on it and take it and have it burned with fire and i will make the towns of judah waste and unpeopled
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying
 go into the house of the rechabites and have talk with them and take them into the house of the lord into one of the rooms and give them wine
 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and all the rechabites
 and i took them into the house of the lord into the room of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah the man of god which was near the rulers room which was over the room of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door
 and i put before the sons of the rechabites basins full of wine and cups and i said to them take some wine
 but they said we will take no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father gave us orders saying you are to take no wine you or your sons for ever
 and you are to make no houses or put in seed or get vine gardens planted or have any but all your days you are to go on living in tents so that you may have a long life in the land where you are living as in a strange country
 and we have kept the rules of jonadab the son of rechab our father in everything which he gave us orders to do drinking no wine all our days we and our wives and our sons and our daughters
 building no houses for ourselves having no vine gardens or fields or seed
 but we have been living in tents and have done everything which jonadab our father gave us orders to do
 but when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land we said come let us go to jerusalem away from the army of the chaldaeans and from the army of the aramaeans and so we are living in jerusalem
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said go and say to the men of judah and the people of jerusalem is there no hope of teaching you to give ear to my words says the lord
 the orders which jonadab the son of rechab gave to his sons to take no wine are done and to this day they take no wine for they do the orders of their father but i have sent my words to you getting up early and sending them and you have not given ear to me
 and i have sent you all my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them saying come back now every man from his evil way and do better and go not after other gods to become their servants and you will go on living in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but your ears have not been open and you have not given attention to me
 though the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have done the orders of their father which he gave them this people has not given ear to me
 for this reason the lord the god of armies the god of israel has said see i will send on judah and on all the people of jerusalem all the evil which i said i would do to them because i sent my words to them but they did not give ear crying out to them but they gave no answer
 but to the rechabites jeremiah said this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said because you have done the orders of jonadab your father and have kept his rules and done everything as he gave you orders to do it
