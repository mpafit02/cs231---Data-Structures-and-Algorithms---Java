 truly as a wife is false to her husband so have you been false to me o israel says the lord
 a voice is sounding on the open hilltops the weeping and the prayers of the children of israel because their way is twisted they have not kept the lord their god in mind
 come back you children who have been turned away and i will take away your desire for wandering see we have come to you for you are the lord our god
 truly the hills and the noise of an army on the mountains are a false hope truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel
 but the baal has taken all the work of our fathers from our earliest days their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
 let us be stretched on the earth in our downfall covering ourselves with our shame for we have been sinners against the lord our god we and our fathers from our earliest years even till this day and we have not given ear to the voice of the lord our god
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 the lord the god of israel has said put down in a book all the words which i have said to you
 for see the days are coming says the lord when i will let the fate of my people israel and judah be changed says the lord and i will make them come back to the land which i gave to their fathers so that they may take it for their heritage
 and these are the words which the lord said about israel and about judah
 this is what the lord has said a voice of shaking fear has come to our ears of fear and not of peace
 put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birth pains why do i see every man with his hands gripping his sides as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her and all faces are turned green
 ha  for that day is so great that there is no day like it it is the time of jacobs trouble but he will get salvation from it
 for it will come about on that day says the lord of armies that his yoke will be broken off his neck and his bands will be burst and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant
 but they will be servants to the lord their god and to david their king whom i will give back to them
 so have no fear o jacob my servant says the lord and do not be troubled o israel for see i will make you come back from far away and your seed from the land where they are prisoners and jacob will come back and will be quiet and at peace and no one will give him cause for fear
 for i am with you says the lord to be your saviour for i will put an end to all the nations where i have sent you wandering but i will not put an end to you completely though with wise purpose i will put right your errors and will not let you go quite without punishment
 for the lord has said your disease may not be made well and your wound is bitter
 there is no help for your wound there is nothing to make you well
 your lovers have no more thought for you they go after you no longer for i have given you the wound of a hater even cruel punishment
 why are you crying for help because of your wound for your pain may never be taken away because your evil doing was so great and because your sins were increased i have done these things to you
 for this cause all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food and all your attackers every one of them will be taken prisoners and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction and all those who take away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves
 for i will make you healthy again and i will make you well from your wounds says the lord because they have given you the name of an outlaw saying it is zion cared for by no man
 the lord has said see i am changing the fate of the tents of jacob and i will have pity on his houses the town will be put up on its hill and the great houses will be living places again
 and from them will go out praise and the sound of laughing and i will make them great in number and they will not become less and i will give them glory and they will not be small
 and their children will be as they were in the old days and the meeting of the people will have its place before me and i will send punishment on all who are cruel to them
 and their chief will be of their number their ruler will come from among themselves and i will let him be present before me so that he may come near to me for who may have strength of heart to come near me says the lord
 and you will be my people and i will be your god
 see the storm wind of the lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evil doers
 the wrath of the lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
