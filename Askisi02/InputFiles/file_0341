 but one of the young men said to nabals wife abigail david sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master and he gave them a rough answer
 but these men have been very good to us they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields
 but day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them looking after the sheep
 so now give thought to what you are going to do for evil is in store for our master and all his house for he is such a good for nothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him
 then abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs and put them on asses
 and she said to her young men go on in front of me and i will come after you but she said nothing to her husband nabal
 now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass david and his men came down against her and suddenly she came face to face with them
 now david had said what was the use of my taking care of this mans goods in the waste land so that there was no loss of anything which was his he has only given me back evil for good
 may gods punishment be on david if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living
 and when abigail saw david she quickly got off her ass falling down on her face before him
 and falling at his feet she said may the wrong be on me my lord on me let your servant say a word to you and give ear to the words of your servant
 let my lord give no attention to nabal that good for nothing for as his name is so is he a man without sense but i your servant did not see the young men whom my lord sent
 so now my lord by the living god and by your living soul seeing that the lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs may all your haters and those who would do evil to my lord be like nabal
 and let this offering which your servant gives to my lord be given to the young men who are with my lord
 and may the sin of your servant have forgiveness for the lord will certainly make your family strong because my lord is fighting in the lords war and no evil will be seen in you all your days
 and though a man has taken up arms against you putting your life in danger still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the lord your god and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him like stones from a bag
 and when the lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you and has made you a ruler over israel
 then you will have no cause for grief and my lords heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs and when the lord has been good to you then give a thought to your servant
 and david said to abigail may the lord the god of israel be praised who sent you to me today
 a blessing on your good sense and on you who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs
 for truly by the living lord the god of israel who has kept me from doing you evil if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me by dawn there would not have been in nabals house so much as one male living
 then david took from her hands her offering and he said to her go back to your house in peace see i have given ear to your voice and taken your offering with respect
 and abigail went back to nabal and he was feasting in his house like a king and nabals heart was full of joy for he had taken much wine so she said nothing to him till dawn came
 and in the morning when the effect of the wine was gone nabals wife gave him an account of all these things and all the heart went out of him and he became like stone
 and about ten days after the lord sent disease on nabal and death came to him
 and david hearing that nabal was dead said may the lord be praised who has taken up my cause against nabal for the shame which he put on me and has kept back his servant from evil and has sent on nabals head the reward of his evil doing and david sent word to abigail desiring to take her as his wife
 and when davids servants came to carmel to abigail they said to her david has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife
 and she got up and going down on her face to the earth said see i am ready to be a servant girl washing the feet of the servants of my lord
 then abigail got up quickly and went on her ass with five of her young women after the men whom david had sent and she became davids wife
 and david had taken ahinoam of jezreel to be his wife these two were his wives
