 for this reason am i loved by the father because i give up my life so that i may take it again
 no one takes it away from me i give it up of myself i have power to give it up and i have power to take it again these orders i have from my father
 there was a division again among the jews because of these words
 and a number of them said he has an evil spirit and is out of his mind why do you give ear to him
 others said these are not the words of one who has an evil spirit is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see
 then came the feast of the opening of the temple in jerusalem it was winter
 and jesus was walking in the temple in solomons covered way
 then the jews came round him saying how long are you going to keep us in doubt if you are the christ say so clearly
 jesus said in answer i have said it and you have no belief the works which i do in my fathers name these give witness about me
 but you have no belief because you are not of my sheep
 my sheep give ear to my voice and i have knowledge of them and they come after me
 and i give them eternal life they will never come to destruction and no one will ever take them out of my hand
 that which my father has given to me has more value than all and no one is able to take anything out of the fathers hand
 i and my father are one
 then the jews took up stones again to send at him
 jesus said to them in answer i have let you see a number of good works from the father for which of those works are you stoning me
 this was their answer we are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words because being a man you make yourself god
 in answer jesus said is there not a saying in your law i said you are gods
 if he said they were gods to whom the word of god came  and the writings may not be broken 
 do you say of him whom the father made holy and sent into the world your words are evil because i said i am gods son
 if i am not doing the works of my father do not have belief in me
 but if i am doing them then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me so that you may see clearly and be certain that the father is in me and i am in the father
 then again they made an attempt to take him but he got away from them
 and he went again to the other side of the jordan to the place where john first gave baptism and he was there for a time
 and a great number of people came to him saying john did no sign but everything john said of this man was true
 and a number came to have faith in him there
 now a certain man named lazarus was ill he was of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
  the mary whose brother lazarus was ill was the mary who put perfumed oil on the lord and made his feet dry with her hair 
 so the sisters sent to him saying lord your dear friend is ill
 when this came to his ears jesus said the end of this disease is not death but the glory of god so that the son of god may have glory because of it
