 and before their eyes take your goods on your back and go out in the dark go with your face covered for i have made you a sign to the children of israel
 and i did as i was ordered i took out my vessels by day like those of one who is taken away and in the evening i made a hole through the wall with a tent pin and in the dark i went out taking my things on my back before their eyes
 and in the morning the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man has not israel the uncontrolled people said to you what are you doing
 you are to say to them this is what the lord has said this word has to do with the ruler in jerusalem and all the children of israel in it
 say i am your sign as i have done so will it be done to them they will go away as prisoners
 and the ruler who is among them will take his goods on his back in the dark and go out he will make a hole in the wall through which to go out he will have his face covered so that he may not be seen
 and my net will be stretched out on him and he will be taken in my cords and i will take him to babylon to the land of the chaldaeans but he will not see it and there death will come to him
 and all his helpers round about him and all his armies i will send in flight to every wind and i will let loose a sword after them
 and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send them in flight among the nations driving them out through the countries
 but a small number of them i will keep from the sword from the need of food and from disease so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come and they will be certain that i am the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man take your food with shaking fear and your water with trouble and care
 and say to the people of the land this is what the lord has said about the people of jerusalem and the land of israel they will take their food with care and their drink with wonder so that all the wealth of their land may be taken from it because of the violent ways of the people living in it
 and the peopled towns will be made waste and the land will become a wonder and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man what is this saying which you have about the land of israel the time is long and every vision comes to nothing
 for this cause say to them this is what the lord has said i have made this saying come to an end and it will no longer be used as a common saying in israel but say to them the days are near and the effect of every vision
 for there will be no more false visions or smooth use of secret arts in israel
 for i am the lord i will say the word and what i say i will do it will not be put off for in your days o uncontrolled people i will say the word and do it says the lord
 again the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man see the children of israel say the vision which he sees is for the days which are a long way off and his words are of times still far away
 say to them then this is what the lord has said not one of my words will be put off any longer but what i say i will do says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man be a prophet against the prophets of israel and say to those prophets whose words are the invention of their hearts give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said a curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing 
 o israel your prophets have been like jackals in the waste places
 you have not gone up into the broken places or made up the wall for the children of israel to take your place in the fight in the day of the lord
 they have seen visions without substance and made use of secret arts who say the lord has said and the lord has not sent them hoping that the word would have effect
 have you not seen a vision without substance and have you not falsely made use of secret arts when you say the lord has said though i have said nothing
