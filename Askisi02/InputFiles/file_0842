 and you are not to take for food any blood of bird or of beast in any of your houses
 whoever takes any blood for food will be cut off from his people
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel he who makes a peace offering to the lord is to give an offering to the lord out of his peace offering
 he himself is to take to the lord the offering made by fire even the fat with the breast so that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the lord
 and the fat is to be burned by the priest on the altar but the breast is for aaron and his sons
 and the right leg you are to give to the priest for an offering to be lifted up out of what is given for your peace offerings
 that man among the sons of aaron by whom the blood of the peace offering and the fat are offered is to have the right leg for his part
 for the breast which is waved and the right leg which is lifted up on high i have taken from the children of israel from their peace offerings and have given them to aaron the priest and to his sons as their right for ever from the children of israel
 this is the holy part given to aaron and to his sons out of the offerings made to the lord by fire on the day when they were made priests before the lord
 which the lord said the children of israel were to give them on the day when he made them his priests it is their right for ever from generation to generation
 these are the laws for the burned offering the meal offering and the offering for wrongdoing and for the making of priests and for the giving of peace offerings
 as they were given by the lord to moses on mount sinai on the day when the lord gave orders to the children of israel to make their offerings to the lord in the waste land of sinai
 and the lord said to moses
 take aaron and his sons with him and the robes and the holy oil and the ox of the sin offering and the two male sheep and the basket of unleavened bread
 and let all the people come together at the door of the tent of meeting
 and moses did as the lord said and all the people came together at the door of the tent of meeting
 and moses said to the people this is what the lord has given orders to be done
 then moses took aaron and his sons and after washing them with water
 he put the coat on him making it tight with its band and then the robe and over it the ephod with its band of needlework to keep it in place
 and he put the priests bag on him and in the bag he put the urim and thummim
 and on his head he put the head dress and in front of the head dress the plate of gold the holy crown as the lord gave orders to moses
 and moses took the holy oil and put it on the house and on all the things in it to make them holy
 seven times he put oil on the altar and on all its vessels and on the washing basin and its base to make them holy
 and some of the oil he put on aarons head to make him holy
 then he took aarons sons clothing them with the coats and putting the bands round them and the head dresses on their heads as the lord had given him orders
 and he took the ox of the sin offering and aaron and his sons put their hands on the head of the ox
 and he put it to death and moses took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and round it with his finger and made the altar clean draining out the blood at the base of the altar so he made it holy taking away what was unclean
 and he took all the fat on the inside parts and the fat on the liver and the two kidneys with their fat to be burned on the altar
 but the ox with its skin and its flesh and its waste was burned with fire outside the tent circle as the lord gave orders to moses
