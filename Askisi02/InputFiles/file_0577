 so with this money get with care oxen sheep and lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings to be offered on the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem
 and whatever seems right to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold that do as may be pleasing to your god
 and the vessels which have been given to you for the uses of the house of your god you are to give to the god of jerusalem
 and whatever more is needed for the house of your god and which you may have to give take it from the kings store house
 and i even i artaxerxes the king now give orders to all keepers of the kings money across the river that whatever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven may have need of from you is to be done with all care
 up to a hundred talents of silver a hundred measures of grain a hundred measures of wine and a hundred measures of oil and salt without measure
 whatever is ordered by the god of heaven let it be done completely for the house of the god of heaven so that there may not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons
 in addition we make it clear to you that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or forced payment on any of the priests or levites the music makers door keepers nethinim or any servants of this house of god
 and you ezra by the wisdom of your god which is in you are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your god and you are to give teaching to him who has no knowledge of them
 and if anyone does not keep the law of your god and the law of the king take care that punishment is given to him by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his goods or by putting him in prison
