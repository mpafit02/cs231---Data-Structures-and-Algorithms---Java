 and the children of israel were servants to eglon king of moab for eighteen years
 then when the children of israel made prayer to the lord he gave them a saviour ehud the son of gera the benjamite a left handed man and the children of israel sent an offering by him to eglon king of moab
 so ehud made himself a two edged sword a cubit long which he put on at his right side under his robe
 and he took the offering to eglon king of moab who was a very fat man
 and after giving the offering he sent away the people who had come with the offering
 but he himself turning back from the stone images at gilgal said i have something to say to you in secret o king and he said let there be quiet then all those who were waiting before him went out
 then ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summer house and ehud said i have a word from god for you and he got up from his seat
 and ehud put out his left hand and took the sword from his right side and sent it into his stomach
 and the hand part went in after the blade and the fat was joined up over the blade for he did not take the sword out of his stomach and he went out into the 
 then ehud went out into the covered way shutting the doors of the summer house on him and locking them
 now when he had gone the kings servants came and saw that the doors of the summer house were locked and they said it may be that he is in his summer house for a private purpose
 and they went on waiting till they were shamed but the doors were still shut so they took the key and opening them saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor
 but ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to seirah
 and when he came there he had a horn sounded in the hill country of ephraim and all the children of israel went down with him from the hill country and he at their head
 and he said to them come after me for the lord has given the moabites your haters into your hands so they went down after him and took the crossing places of jordan against moab and let no one go across
 at that time they put about ten thousand men of moab to the sword every strong man and every man of war not a man got away
 so moab was broken that day under the hand of israel and for eighty years the land had peace
 and after him came shamgar the son of anath who put to death six hundred philistines with an ox stick and he was another saviour of israel
 and the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord when ehud was dead
 and the lord gave them up into the hands of jabin king of canaan who was ruling in hazor the captain of his army was sisera who was living in harosheth of the gentiles
 then the children of israel made prayer to the lord for he had nine hundred iron war carriages and for twenty years he was very cruel to the children of israel
 now deborah a woman prophet the wife of lapidoth was judge of israel at that time
  and she had her seat under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and beth el in the hill country of ephraim and the children of israel came up to her to be judged 
 and she sent for barak the son of abinoam from kedesh naphtali and said to him has not the lord the god of israel given orders saying go and get your force into line in mount tabor and take with you ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun
 and i will make sisera the captain of jabins army with his war carriages and his forces come against you at the river kishon where i will give him into your hands
 and barak said to her if you will go with me then i will go but if you will not go with me i will not go
 and she said i will certainly go with you though you will get no honour in your undertaking for the lord will give sisera into the hands of a woman so deborah got up and went with barak to kedesh
 then barak sent for zebulun and naphtali to come to kedesh and ten thousand men went up after him and deborah went up with him
 now heber the kenite separating himself from the rest of the kenites from the children of hobab the brother in law of moses had put up his tent as far away as the oak tree in zaanannim by kedesh
 and word was given to sisera that barak the son of abinoam had gone up to mount tabor
