 and the dead body of jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of jezreel so that they will not be able to say this is jezebel
 now after the death of saul when david having come back from the destruction of the amalekites had been in ziklag for two days
 on the third day a man came from sauls tents with his clothing out of order and earth on his head and when he came to david he went down on the earth and gave him honour
 and david said to him where have you come from and he said i have come in flight from the tents of israel
 and david said to him how did things go give me the news and in answer he said the people have gone in flight from the fight and a great number of them are dead and saul and his son jonathan are dead
 and david said to the young man who gave him the news why are you certain that saul and his son jonathan are dead
 and the young man said i came by chance to mount gilboa and i saw saul supporting himself on his spear and the war carriages and horsemen overtook him
 and looking back he saw me and gave a cry to me and answering him i said here am i
 and he said to me who are you and i said i am an amalekite
 then he said to me come here to my side and put me to death for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me
 so i put my foot on him and gave him his death blow because i was certain that he would not go on living after his fall and i took the crown from his head and the band from his arm and i have them here for my lord
 then david gave way to bitter grief and so did all the men who were with him
 and till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping and took no food weeping for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the men of israel because they had come to their end by the sword
 and david said to the young man who had given him the news where do you come from and he said i am the son of a man from a strange land i am an amalekite
 and david said to him had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil
 and david sent for one of his young men and said go near and put an end to him and he put him to death
 and david said to him may your blood be on your head for your mouth has given witness against you saying i have put to death the man marked with the holy oil
 then david made this song of grief for saul and jonathan his son
  it is recorded in the book of jashar for teaching to the sons of judah  and he said
 the glory o israel is dead on your high places  how have the great ones been made low 
 give no news of it in gath let it not be said in the streets of ashkelon or the daughters of the philistines will be glad the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy
 o mountains of gilboa let there be no dew or rain on you you fields of death for there the arms of the strong have been shamed the arms of saul as if he had not been marked with the holy oil
 from the blood of the dead from the fat of the strong the bow of jonathan was not turned back the sword of saul did not come back unused
 saul and jonathan were loved and pleasing in their lives and in their death they were not parted they went more quickly than eagles they were stronger than lions
 o daughters of israel have sorrow for saul by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red with ornaments of gold on your dresses
 how have the great ones been made low in the fight  jonathan is dead on your high places
 i am full of grief for you my brother jonathan very dear have you been to me your love for me was a wonder greater than the love of women
 how have the great ones been made low and the arms of war broken 
 now after this death came to the king of the children of ammon and hanun his son became king in his place
 and david said i will be a friend to hanun the son of nahash as his father was a friend to me so david sent his servants to give him words of comfort on account of his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon
