 and about this thing i made request to the lord three times that it might be taken away from me
 and he said to me my grace is enough for you for my power is made complete in what is feeble most gladly then will i take pride in my feeble body so that the power of christ may be on me
 so i take pleasure in being feeble in unkind words in needs in cruel attacks in troubles on account of christ for when i am feeble then am i strong
 i have been forced by you to become foolish though it was right for my praise to have come from you for in no way was i less than the chief of the apostles though i am nothing
 truly the signs of an apostle were done among you in quiet strength with wonders and acts of power
 for what is there in which you were made less than the other churches but in the one thing that i was not a trouble to you let me have forgiveness for this wrong
 this is now the third time that i am ready to come to you and i will not be a trouble to you my desire is for you not for your property for it is not the childrens business to make store for their fathers but the fathers for the children
 and i will gladly give all i have for your souls if i have the more love for you am i to be loved the less
 but let it be so that i was not a trouble to you myself but  someone may say  being false i took you with deceit
 did i make a profit out of you by any of those whom i sent to you
 i gave orders to titus and i sent the brother with him did titus make any profit out of you were we not guided by the same spirit in the same ways
 it may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right but we are saying these things before god in christ for all things dear brothers are for your profit
 for i have a fear that when i come you may not be answering to my desire and that i may not be answering to yours that there may be fighting hate angry feeling divisions evil talk about others secrets thoughts of pride outbursts against authority
 and that when i come again my god may put me to shame among you and i may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way
 this is the third time that i am coming to you from the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain
 i said before and still say it before i come as being present for the second time though i am still away from you to those who have done wrong before and to all the others that if i come again i will not have pity
 seeing that you are looking for a sign of christ giving out his word in me who is not feeble in relation to you but is strong in you
 for he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross but he is living by the power of god and we are feeble in him but we will be living with him through the power of god in relation to you
 make a test of yourselves if you are in the faith make certain of yourselves or are you not conscious in yourselves that jesus christ is in you if you are truly christs
 but it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly christs
 now our prayer to god is that you may do no evil not in order that it may be put to our credit but so that you may do what is right whatever we may seem
 because we are able to do nothing against what is true but only for it
 for we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong and this is our prayer even that you may be made complete
 for this cause i am writing these things while i am away so that there may be need for me when i am present to make use of sharp measures by the authority which the lord has given me for building up and not for destruction
 let this be my last word brothers be glad be complete be comforted be of the same mind be at peace with one another and the god of love and peace will be with you
 give one another a holy kiss
 all the saints send their love to you
 the grace of our lord jesus christ and the love of god and the harmony of the holy spirit be with you all
 but it was my decision for myself not to come again to you with sorrow
 for if i give you sorrow who then will make me glad but he who is made sad by me
