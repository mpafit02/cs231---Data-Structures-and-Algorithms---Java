 have joy and be glad o daughter of edom living in the land of uz the cup will be given to you in your turn and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen
 the punishment of your evil doing is complete o daughter of zion never again will he take you away as a prisoner he will give you the reward of your evil doing o daughter of edom he will let your sin be uncovered
 keep in mind o lord what has come to us take note and see our shame
 our heritage is given up to men of strange lands our houses to those who are not our countrymen
 we are children without fathers our mothers are like widows
 we give money for a drink of water we get our wood for a price
 our attackers are on our necks overcome with weariness we have no rest
 we have given our hands to the egyptians and to the assyrians so that we might have enough bread
 our fathers were sinners and are dead and the weight of their evil doing is on us
 servants are ruling over us and there is no one to make us free from their hands
 we put our lives in danger to get our bread because of the sword of the waste land
 our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food
 they took by force the women in zion the virgins in the towns of judah
 their hands put princes to death by hanging the faces of old men were not honoured
 the young men were crushing the grain and the boys were falling under the wood
 the old men are no longer seated in the doorway and the music of the young men has come to an end
 the joy of our hearts is ended our dancing is changed into sorrow
 the crown has been taken from our head sorrow is ours for we are sinners
 because of this our hearts are feeble for these things our eyes are dark
 because of the mountain of zion which is a waste jackals go over it
 you o lord are seated as king for ever the seat of your power is eternal
 why have we gone from your memory for ever why have you been turned away from us for so long
 make us come back to you o lord and let us be turned make our days new again as in the past
 but you have quite given us up you are full of wrath against us
 and the voice of the lord came to moses out of the tent of meeting saying
 give these orders to the children of israel when anyone of you makes an offering to the lord you are to take it from the cattle from the herd or from the flock
 if the offering is a burned offering of the herd let him give a male without a mark he is to give it at the door of the tent of meeting so that he may be pleasing to the lord
 and he is to put his hand on the head of the burned offering and it will be taken for him to take away his sin
 and the ox is to be put to death before the lord then aarons sons the priests are to take the blood and put some of it on and round the altar which is at the door of the tent of meeting
 and the burned offering is to be skinned and cut up into its parts
