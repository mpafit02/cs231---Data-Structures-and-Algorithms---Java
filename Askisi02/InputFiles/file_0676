 so they will see the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the east for he will come like a rushing stream forced on by a wind of the lord
 and as a saviour he will come to zion turning away sin from jacob says the lord
 and as for me this is my agreement with them says the lord my spirit which is on you and my words which i have put in your mouth will not go away from your mouth or from the mouth of your seed or from the mouth of your seeds seed says the lord from now and for ever
 in the year of king uzziahs death i saw the lord seated in his place high and lifted up and the temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe
 over him were the winged ones every one had six wings two for covering his face two for covering his feed and two for flight
 and one said in a loud voice to another holy holy holy is the lord of armies all the earth is full of his glory
 and the bases of the door pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry and the house was full of smoke
 then i said the curse is on me and my fate is destruction for i am a man of unclean lips living among a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of armies
 then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand which he had taken from off the altar with the fire spoon
 and after touching my mouth with it he said see your lips have been touched with this and your evil is taken away and you are made clean from sin
 and the voice of the lord came to my ears saying whom am i to send and who will go for us then i said here am i send me
 and he said go and say to this people you will go on hearing but learning nothing you will go on seeing but without getting wiser
 make the hearts of this people fat and let their ears be stopped and their eyes shut for fear that they may see with their eyes and be hearing with their ears and their heart may become wise and they may be turned to me and made well
 then i said lord how long and he said in answer till the towns are waste and unpeopled and the houses have no men and the land becomes completely waste
 and the lord has taken men far away and there are wide waste places in the land
 and even if there is still a tenth part in it it will again be burned like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down  the holy seed is the broken end 
 up  let your face be bright for your light has come and the glory of the lord is shining on you
 for truly the earth will be dark and the peoples veiled in blackest night but the lord will be shining on you and his glory will be seen among you
 and nations will come to your light and kings to your bright dawn
 let your eyes be lifted up and see they are all coming together to you your sons will come from far and your daughters taken with loving care
 then you will see and be bright with joy and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight for the produce of the sea will be turned to you the wealth of the nations will come to you
 you will be full of camel trains even the young camels of midian and ephah all from sheba will come with gold and spices giving word of the great acts of the lord
 all the flocks of kedar will come together to you the sheep of nebaioth will be ready for your need they will be pleasing offerings on my altar and my house of prayer will be beautiful
 who are these coming like a cloud like a flight of doves to their windows
 vessels of the sea lands are waiting for me and the ships of tarshish first so that your sons may come from far and their silver and gold with them to the place of the name of the lord your god and to the holy one of israel because he has made you beautiful
 and men from strange countries will be building up your walls and their kings will be your servants for in my wrath i sent punishment on you but in my grace i have had mercy on you
 your doors will be open at all times they will not be shut day or night so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations with their kings at their head
 for the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction such nations will be completely waste
 the glory of lebanon will come to you the cypress the plane and the sherbin tree together to make my holy place beautiful and the resting place of my feet will be full of glory
 and the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet and you will be named the town of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel
