 you are to see that the family of ahab your master is cut off so that i may take from jezebel payment for the blood of my servants the prophets and for the blood of all the servants of the lord
 for the family of ahab will come to an end every male of ahabs family will be cut off he who is shut up and he who goes free in israel
 i will make the family of ahab like that of jeroboam the son of nebat and baasha the son of ahijah
 and jezebel will become food for the dogs in the heritage of jezreel and there will be no one to put her body into the earth then opening the door he went in flight
 then jehu came out again to the servants of his lord and one said to him is all well why did this man who is off his head come to you and he said to them you have knowledge of the man and of his talk
 and they said that is not true now give us his story then he said this is what he said to me the lord says i have made you king over israel
 then straight away everyone took his robe and put it under him on the top of the steps and sounding the horn they said jehu is king
 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi made designs against joram  now joram and all the army of israel were keeping watch on ramoth gilead because of hazael king of aram
 but king joram had gone back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which the aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against hazael king of aram  and jehu said if this is your purpose then let no one get away and go out of the town to give news of it in jezreel
 so jehu got into his carriage and went to jezreel for joram was ill in bed there and ahaziah king of judah had come down to see joram
 and the watchman on the tower in jezreel saw jehu and his band coming and said i see a band of people and joram said send out a horseman to them and let him say is it peace
 so a horseman went out to them and said the king says is it peace and jehu said what have you to do with peace come after me and the watchman gave them word saying the horseman went up to them but has not come back
 then he sent out a second horseman who came up to them and said the king says is it peace and jehu said in answer what have you to do with peace come after me
 and the watchman gave them word saying he went up to them and has not come back again and the driving is like the driving of jehu son of nimshi for he is driving violently
 then joram said make ready so they made his carriage ready and joram king of israel with ahaziah king of judah went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting jehu and they came face to face with him at the field of naboth the jezreelite
 now when joram saw jehu he said is it peace jehu and he said in answer what peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother jezebel and her secret arts
 then joram turning his horses in flight said to ahaziah broken faith o ahaziah 
 then jehu took his bow in his hand and with all his strength sent an arrow wounding joram between the arms and the arrow came out at his heart and he went down on his face in his carriage
 then jehu said to bidkar his captain take him up and put him in the field of naboth the jezreelite for is not that day in your memory when you and i together on our horses were going after ahab his father and the lord put this fate on him saying
 i saw the blood of naboth and of his sons yesterday and i will give you full payment in this field says the lord so now take him and put him in this field as the lord said
 now when ahaziah king of judah saw this he went in flight by the way of the garden house and jehu came after him and said put him to death in the same way and they gave him a death wound in his carriage on the slope up to gur by ibleam and he went in flight to megiddo where death came to him
 and his servants took him in a carriage to jerusalem and put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of david
  in the eleventh year of the rule of joram the son of ahab ahaziah became king over judah 
 and when jehu came to jezreel jezebel had news of it and painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments she put her head out of the window
 and when jehu was coming into the town she said is all well o zimri taker of your masters life
 then looking up to the window he said who is on my side who and two or three unsexed servants put out their heads
 and he said take her and put her out of the window so they sent her down with force and her blood went in a shower on the wall and on the horses and she was crushed under their feet
 and he came in and took food and drink then he said now see to this cursed woman and put her body into the earth for she is a kings daughter
 and they went out to put her body into the earth but nothing of her was to be seen only the bones of her head and her feet and parts of her hands
 so they came back and gave him word of it and he said this is what the lord said by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the heritage of jezreel the flesh of jezebel will become food for dogs
