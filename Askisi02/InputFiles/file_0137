 and straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to god
 and fear came on all those who were living round about them and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill country of judaea
 and all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said what will this child be for the hand of the lord was with him
 and his father zacharias was full of the holy spirit and with the voice of a prophet said these words
 praise be to the lord the god of israel for he has come to his people and made them free
 lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
  as he said by the mouth of his holy prophets from the earliest times 
 salvation from those who are against us and from the hands of those who have hate for us
 to do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word
 the oath which he made to abraham our father
 that we being made free from the fear of those who are against us might give him worship
 in righteousness and holy living before him all our days
 and you child will be named the prophet of the most high you will go before the face of the lord to make ready his ways
 to give knowledge of salvation to his people through the forgiveness of sins
 because of the loving mercies of our god by which the dawn from heaven has come to us
 to give light to those in dark places and in the shade of death so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace
 and the child became tall and strong in spirit and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of israel
 now after these things the lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him two together into every town and place where he himself was about to come
 and he said to them there is much grain ready to be cut but not enough workers so make prayer to the lord of the grain fields that he will send workers to get in the grain
 go on your way see i send you out like lambs among wolves
 take no bag for money or for food and no shoes say no word to any man on the way
 and whenever you go into a house first say peace be to this house
 and if a son of peace is there your peace will be with him but if not it will come back to you again
 and keep in that same house taking what food and drink they give you for the worker has a right to his reward do not go from house to house
 and into whatever town you go if they take you in take whatever food is given to you
 and make well those in it who are ill and say to them the kingdom of god is near to you
 but if you go into a town where they will not have you go out into the streets of it and say
 even the dust of your town which is on our feet we put off as a witness against you but be certain of this that the kingdom of god is near
 i say to you it will be better in that day for sodom than for that town
 a curse is on you chorazin  a curse is on you beth saida  for if such works of power had been done in tyre and sidon as have been done in you they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by seated in the dust
