 you will have food but not enough your shame will be ever with you you will get your goods moved but you will not take them away safely and what you do take away i will give to the sword
 you will put in seed but you will not get in the grain you will be crushing olives but your bodies will not be rubbed with the oil and you will get in the grapes but you will have no wine
 for you have kept the laws of omri and all the works of the family of ahab and you have been guided by their designs so that i might make you a cause of wonder and your people a cause of hisses and the shame of my people will be on you
 sorrow is mine  for i am as when they have got in the summer fruits like the last of the grapes there is nothing for food not even an early fig for my desire
 the good man is gone from the earth there is no one upright among men they are all waiting secretly for blood every man is going after his brother with a net
 their hands are made ready to do evil the ruler makes requests for money and the judge is looking for a reward and the great man gives decisions at his pleasure and the right is twisted
 the best of them is like a waste plant and their upright ones are like a wall of thorns sorrow  the day of their fate has come now will trouble come on them
 put no faith in a friend do not let your hope be placed in a relation keep watch on the doors of your mouth against her who is resting on your breast
 for the son puts shame on his father the daughter goes against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans haters are those of his family
 but as for me i am looking to the lord i am waiting for the god of my salvation the ears of my god will be open to me
 do not be glad because of my sorrow o my hater after my fall i will be lifted up when i am seated in the dark the lord will be a light to me
 i will undergo the wrath of the lord because of my sin against him till he takes up my cause and does what is right for me when he makes me come out into the light i will see his righteousness
 and my hater will see it and be covered with shame she who said to me where is the lord your god my eyes will see their desire effected on her now she will be crushed under foot like the dust of the streets
 a day for building your walls  in that day will your limits be stretched far and wide
 in that day they will come to you from assyria and the towns of egypt and from egypt even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
 but the land will become a waste because of its people as the fruit of their works
 keep your people safe with your rod the flock of your heritage living by themselves in the woods in the middle of carmel let them get their food in bashan and gilead as in the past
 as in the days when you came out from the land of egypt let us see things of wonder
 the nations will see and be shamed because of all their strength they will put their hands on their mouths their ears will be stopped
 they will take dust as their food like a snake like the things which go flat on the earth they will come shaking with fear out of their secret places they will come with fear to the lord our god full of fear because of you
 who is a god like you offering forgiveness for evil doing and overlooking the sins of the rest of his heritage he does not keep his wrath for ever because his delight is in mercy
 he will again have pity on us he will put our sins under his feet and you will send all our sins down into the heart of the sea
 you will make clear your good faith to jacob and your mercy to abraham as you gave your oath to our fathers from times long past
 the word about nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite
 the lord is a god who takes care of his honour and gives punishment for wrong the lord gives punishment and is angry the lord sends punishment on those who are against him being angry with his haters
 the lord is slow to get angry and great in power and will not let the sinner go without punishment the way of the lord is in the wind and the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet
 he says sharp words to the sea and makes it dry drying up all the rivers bashan is feeble and carmel and the flower of lebanon is without strength
 the mountains are shaking because of him and the hills flowing away the earth is falling to bits before him the world and all who are in it
 who may keep his place before his wrath and who may undergo the heat of his passion his wrath is let loose like fire and the rocks are broken open by him
 the lord is good a strong place in the day of trouble and he has knowledge of those who take him for their safe cover
