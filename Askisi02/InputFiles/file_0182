 but he got away unclothed without the linen cloth
 and they took jesus away to the high priest and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes
 and peter had come after him at a distance even into the house of the high priest and he was seated with the captains warming himself in the light of the fire
 now the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were looking for witness against jesus so that they might put him to death and they were unable to get any
 for a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement
 then some got up and gave false witness against him saying
 he said in our hearing i will put an end to this temple which is made with hands and in three days i will make another without hands
 and even so their witness was not in agreement
 and the high priest got up in the middle of them and said to jesus do you say nothing in answer what is it which these say against you
 but he kept quiet and said nothing again the high priest questioning him said are you the christ the son of the holy one
 and jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven
 and the high priest violently parting his robes said what more need have we of witnesses
 his words against god have come to your ears what is your opinion and they all said it was right for him to be put to death
 and some put shame on him and covering his face gave him blows and said to him now say what is to come and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands
 and while peter was down in the open square of the building one of the servant girls of the high priest came
 and seeing peter warming himself by the fire she gave him a look and said you were with this nazarene even jesus
 but he said i have no knowledge of him or of what you are saying and he went out into the doorway and there came the cry of a cock
 and the girl saw him and said again to those who were near this is one of them
 but again he said it was not so and after a little time again those who were near said to peter truly you are one of them for you are a galilaean
 but with curses and oaths he said i have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking
 and in the same minute the cock gave a second cry and it came to peters mind how jesus had said to him before the cocks second cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me and at this thought he was overcome with weeping
 and the first thing in the morning the chief priests with those in authority and the scribes and all the sanhedrin had a meeting and put cords round jesus and took him away and gave him up to pilate
 and pilate put a question to him are you the king of the jews and he answering said to him you say so
 and the chief priests said a number of things against him
 and pilate again put a question do you say nothing in answer see how much evil they say you have done
 but jesus gave no more answers so that pilate was full of wonder
 now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request
 and there was one named barabbas in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life
 and the people went up requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years
 and pilate said in answer to them is it your desire that i let the king of the jews go free
