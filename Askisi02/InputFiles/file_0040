 for it is an act of righteousness on gods part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you
 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire
 to give punishment to those who have no knowledge of god and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our lord jesus
 whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his strength
 at his coming when he will have glory in his saints and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith  because our witness among you had effect  in that day
 for this reason you are ever in our prayers that you may seem to our god such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose and the work of faith complete
 so that glory may be given to the name of our lord jesus through you and you may have glory in him by the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
 now as to the coming of the lord jesus christ and our meeting with him it is our desire my brothers
 that you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit or by a word or by a letter as from us with the suggestion that the day of the lord is even now come
 give no belief to false words because there will first be a falling away from the faith and the revelation of the man of sin the son of destruction
 who puts himself against all authority lifting himself up over all which is named god or is given worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god putting himself forward as god
 have you no memory of what i said when i was with you giving you word of these things
 and now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen
 for the secret of evil is even now at work but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way
 and then will come the revelation of that evil one whom the lord jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming
 even the one whose coming is marked by the working of satan with all power and signs and false wonders
 and with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation
 and for this cause god will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false
 so that they all may be judged who had no faith in what is true but took pleasure in evil
 but it is right for us to give praise to god at all times for you brothers loved by the lord because it was the purpose of god from the first that you might have salvation being made holy by the spirit and by faith in what is true
 and in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers even that you might have part in the glory of our lord jesus christ
 so then brothers be strong in purpose and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us
 now our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace
 give you comfort and strength in every good work and word
 for the rest my brothers let there be prayer for us that the word of the lord may go forward with increasing glory even as it does with you
 and that we may be made free from foolish and evil men for not all have faith
 but the lord is true who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil
 and we have faith in the lord about you that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders
 and may your hearts be guided by the lord into the love of god and quiet waiting for christ
 now we give you orders brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us
