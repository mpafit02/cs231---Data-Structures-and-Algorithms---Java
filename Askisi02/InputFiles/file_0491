 you are to put on one side for the lord every mothers first male child the first fruit of her body and the first young one of every beast every male is holy to the lord
 and for the young of an ass you may give a lamb in payment or if you will not make payment for it its neck is to be broken but for all the first sons among your children let payment be made
 and when your son says to you in time to come what is the reason for this say to him by the strength of his hand the lord took us out of egypt out of the prison house
 and when pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go the lord sent death on all the first sons in egypt of man and of beast and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the lord but for all the first of my sons i give a price
 and this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow for by the strength of his hand the lord took us out of egypt
 now after pharaoh had let the people go god did not take them through the land of the philistines though that was near for god said if the people see war they may have a change of heart and go back to egypt
 but god took the people round by the waste land near the red sea and the children of israel went up in fighting order out of the land of egypt
 and moses took the bones of joseph with him for joseph had made the children of israel take an oath saying god will certainly keep you in mind and you are to take my bones away with you
 then they went on their journey from succoth and put up their tents in etham at the edge of the waste land
 and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud guiding them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they were able to go on day and night
 the pillar of cloud went ever before them by day and the pillar of fire by night
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel to go back and put up their tents before pi hahiroth between migdol and the sea in front of baal zephon opposite to which you are to put up your tents by the sea
 and pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are wandering without direction they are shut in by the waste land
 and i will make pharaohs heart hard and he will come after them and i will be honoured over pharaoh and all his army so that the egyptians may see that i am the lord and they did so
 and word came to pharaoh of the flight of the people and the feeling of pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed and they said why have we let israel go so that they will do no more work for us
 so he had his war carriage made ready and took his people with him
 and he took six hundred carriages all the carriages of egypt and captains over all of them
 and the lord made the heart of pharaoh hard and he went after the children of israel for the children of israel had gone out without fear
 but the egyptians went after them all the horses and carriages of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them in their tents by the sea by pihahiroth before baal zephon
 and when pharaoh came near the children of israel lifting up their eyes saw the egyptians coming after them and were full of fear and their cry went up to god
 and they said to moses was there no resting place for the dead in egypt that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land why have you taken us out of egypt
 did we not say to you in egypt let us be as we are working for the egyptians for it is better to be the servants of the egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land
 but moses said keep where you are and have no fear now you will see the salvation of the lord which he will give you today for the egyptians whom you see today you will never see again
 the lord will make war for you you have only to keep quiet
 and the lord said to moses why are you crying out to me give the children of israel the order to go forward
 and let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea and it will be parted in two and the children of israel will go through on dry land
 and i will make the heart of the egyptians hard and they will go in after them and i will be honoured over pharaoh and over his army his war carriages and his horsemen
 and the egyptians will see that i am the lord when i get honour over pharaoh and his war carriages and his horsemen
 then the angel of god who had been before the tents of israel took his place at their back and the pillar of cloud moving from before them came to rest at their back
