 and when it came to the ears of those who were against us that we had knowledge of their designs and that god had made their purpose come to nothing we all went back to the wall everyone to his work
 and from that time half of my servants were doing their part of the work and half kept the spears and body covers and the bows and the metal war dresses and the chiefs were at the back of the men of judah
 those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part everyone working with one hand with his spear in the other
 every builder was working with his sword at his side and by my side was a man for sounding the horn
 and i said to the great ones and the chiefs and the rest of the people the work is great and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall
 wherever you may be when the horn is sounded come here to us our god will be fighting for us
 so we went on with the work and half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen
 and at the same time i said to the people let everyone with his servant come inside jerusalem for the night so that at night they may keep watch for us and go on working by day
 so not one of us i or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me took off his clothing everyone went armed to the water
 then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the jews
 for there were some who said we our sons and our daughters are a great number let us get grain so that we may have food for our needs
 and there were some who said we are giving our fields and our vine gardens and our houses for debt let us get grain because we are in need
 and there were others who said we have given up our fields and our vine gardens to get money for the kings taxes
 but our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen and our children as their children and now we are giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others to be their servants and some of our daughters are servants even now and we have no power to put a stop to it for other men have our fields and our vine gardens
 and on hearing their outcry and what they said i was very angry
 and after turning it over in my mind i made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers and said to them every one of you is taking interest from his countryman and i got together a great meeting of protest
 and i said to them we have given whatever we were able to give to make our brothers the jews free who were servants and prisoners of the nations and would you now give up your brothers for a price and are they to become our property then they said nothing answering not a word
 and i said what you are doing is not good is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our god because of the shame which the nations may put on us
 even i and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have so now let us give up this thing
 give back to them this very day their fields their vine gardens their olive gardens and their houses as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them
 then they said we will give them back and take nothing for them we will do as you say then i sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement
 and shaking out the folds of my robe i said so may god send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement even so let him be sent out and made as nothing and all the meeting of the people said so be it and gave praise to the lord and the people did as they had said
 now from the time when i was made ruler of the people in the land of judah from the twentieth year till the thirty second year of artaxerxes the king for twelve years i and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler
 but earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver and even their servants were lords over the people but i did not do so because of the fear of god
 and i kept on with the work of this wall and we got no land for ourselves and all my servants were helping with the work
 and more than this a hundred and fifty of the jews and the rulers were guests at my table in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us
 now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep as well as fowls and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine but all the same i did not take the food to which the ruler had a right because the people were crushed under a hard yoke
 keep in mind o my god for my good all i have done for this people
 now when word was given to sanballat and tobiah and to geshem the arabian and to the rest of our haters that i had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it  though even then i had not put up the doors in the doorways 
 sanballat and geshem sent to me saying come let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of ono but their purpose was to do me evil
