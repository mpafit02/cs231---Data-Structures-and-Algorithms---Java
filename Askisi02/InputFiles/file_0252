 give my love to tryphaena and tryphosa workers in the lord give my love to my dear persis who did much work in the lord
 give my love to rufus one of the lords selection and to his mother and mine
 give my love to asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brothers who are with them
 give my love to philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them
 give one another a holy kiss all the churches of christ send their love to you
 now it is my desire brothers that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you quite against the teaching which was given to you and keep away from them
 for such people are not servants of the lord christ but of their stomachs and by their smooth and well said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked
 for all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered for this reason i have joy in you but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good and without knowledge of evil
 and the god of peace will be crushing satan under your feet before long the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 timothy who is working with me sends his love to you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relations
 i tertius who have done the writing of this letter send love in the lord
 gaius with whom i am living whose house is open to all the church sends his love so does erastus the manager of the accounts of the town and quartus the brother
   
 now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which i gave you and the preaching of jesus christ in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal
 but is now made clear and by the writings of the prophets by the order of the eternal god the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations so that they may come under the rule of the faith
 to the only wise god through jesus christ be the glory for ever so be it
 so you have no reason whoever you are for judging for in judging another you are judging yourself for you do the same things
 and we are conscious that god is a true judge against those who do such things
 but you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself are you hoping that gods decision will not take effect against you
 or is it nothing to you that god had pity on you waiting and putting up with you for so long not seeing that in his pity gods desire is to give you a change of heart
 but by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of gods judging in righteousness
 who will give to every man his right reward
 to those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death he will give eternal life
 but to those who from a love of competition are not guided by what is true will come the heat of his wrath
 trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil to the jew first and then to the greek
 but glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good to the jew first and then to the greek
 for one man is not different from another before god
 all those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law
 for it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before god but only the doers
 for when the gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law they are a law to themselves
