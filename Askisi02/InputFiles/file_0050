 for so the lord has given us orders saying i have given you for a light to the gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth
 and the gentiles hearing this were glad and gave glory to the word of god and those marked out by god for eternal life had faith
 and the word of the lord went through all the country
 but the jews working up the feelings of the god fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town got an attack started against paul and barnabas driving them out of those parts
 but they shaking off the dust of that place from their feet came to iconium
 and the disciples were full of joy and of the holy spirit
 now in iconium they went together to the synagogue of the jews and gave such teaching that a great number of jews and greeks had faith
 but those jews who had not the faith made the minds of the gentiles bitter against the brothers
 so they kept there for a long time taking heart in the lord who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands
 but there was a division among the people of the town some were on the side of the jews and some on the side of the apostles
 and when a violent attempt was made by the gentiles and the jews with their rulers to make an attack on them and have them stoned
 having got news of it they went in flight to the towns of lycaonia lystra and derbe and the country round about
 and went on preaching the good news there
 and at lystra there was a certain man who from birth had been without the use of his feet never having had the power of walking
 this man was giving ear to the preaching of paul who looking at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well
 said in a loud voice get up on your feet and jumping up he went walking about
 and when the people saw what paul had done they said in a loud voice in the language of lycaonia the gods have come down to us in the form of men
 and they gave the name of jupiter to barnabas and to paul that of mercury because he was the chief talker
 and the priest of the image of jupiter which was before the town took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town and was about to make an offering with the people
 but when this came to the ears of the apostles paul and barnabas they went running out among the people parting their clothing and crying out
 good people why are you doing these things we are men with the same feelings as you and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them
 who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them
 but he was not without witness because he did good and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit making your hearts full of food and joy
 and even with these words it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them
 but some jews came to that place from antioch and iconium and got control over the people and after stoning paul they had him pulled out of the town taking him for dead
 but when the disciples came round him he got up and went into the town and the day after he went away with barnabas to derbe
 and having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town they went back to lystra and iconium and antioch
 making strong the souls of the disciples saying to them that they were to keep the faith and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of god
 and when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food they put them into the care of the lord in whom they had faith
 and they went through pisidia and came to pamphylia
