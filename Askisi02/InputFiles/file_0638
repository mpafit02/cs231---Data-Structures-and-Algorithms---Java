 after two days he will give us life and on the third day he will make us get up and we will be living before him
 and let us have knowledge let us go after the knowledge of the lord his going out is certain as the dawn his decisions go out like the light he will come to us like the rain like the spring rain watering the earth
 o ephraim what am i to do to you o judah what am i to do to you for your love is like a morning cloud and like the dew which goes early away
 so i have had it cut in stones i gave them teaching by the words of my mouth
 because my desire is for mercy and not offerings for the knowledge of god more than for burned offerings
 but like a man they have gone against the agreement there they were false to me
 gilead is a town of evil doers marked with blood
 and like a band of thieves waiting for a man so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to shechem for they are working with an evil design
 in israel i have seen a very evil thing there false ways are seen in ephraim israel is unclean
 and judah has put up disgusting images for himself
 when my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make israel well then the sin of ephraim was made clear and the evil doing of samaria for their ways are false and the thief comes into the house while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets
 and they do not say to themselves that i keep in mind all their sin now their evil acts come round them on every side they are before my face
 in their sin they make a king for themselves and rulers in their deceit
 they are all untrue they are like a burning oven the bread maker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened
 on the day of our king the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine his hand was stretched out with the men of pride
 for they have made their hearts ready like an oven while they are waiting secretly their wrath is sleeping all night in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire
 they are all heated like an oven and they put an end to their judges all their kings have been made low not one among them makes prayer to me
 ephraim is mixed with the peoples ephraim is a cake not turned
 men from other lands have made waste his strength and he is not conscious of it grey hairs have come on him here and there and he has no knowledge of it
 and the pride of israel gives an answer to his face but for all this they have not gone back to the lord their god or made search for him
 and ephraim is like a foolish dove without wisdom they send out their cry to egypt they go to assyria
 when they go my net will be stretched out over them i will take them like the birds of heaven i will give them punishment i will take them away in the net for their sin
 may trouble be theirs  for they have gone far away from me and destruction for they have been sinning against me i was ready to be their saviour but they said false words against me
 and they have not made prayer to me in their hearts but they make loud cries on their beds they are cutting themselves for food and wine they are turned against me
 though i have given training and strength to their arms they have evil designs against me
 they have gone to what is of no value they are like a false bow their captains will come to destruction by the sword and their ruler by my wrath for this the land of egypt will make sport of them
 put the horn to your mouth he comes like an eagle against the house of the lord because they have gone against my agreement they have not kept my law
 they will send up to me a cry for help we israel have knowledge of you o god of israel
 israel has given up what is good his haters will go after him
 they have put up kings but not by me they have made princes but i had no knowledge of it they have made images of silver and gold so that they may be cut off
