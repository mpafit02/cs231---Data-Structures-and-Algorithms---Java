 now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument and it will be that when the evil spirit from god is on you he will make music for you on his instrument and you will get well
 and saul said to his servants then get me a man who is an expert player and make him come to me
 then one of the servants in answer said i have seen a son of jesse the beth lehemite who is expert at playing and a strong man and a man of war and he is wise in his words and pleasing in looks and the lord is with him
 so saul sent his servants to jesse and said send me your son david who is with the sheep
 and jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to saul by david
 and david came to saul waiting before him and he became very dear to saul who made him his servant giving him the care of his arms
 and saul sent to jesse saying let david be with me for he is pleasing to me
 and whenever the evil spirit from god came on saul david took his instrument and made music so new life came to saul and he got well and the evil spirit went away from him
 now the philistines got their armies together for war and came together at socoh in the land of judah and took up their position between socoh and azekah in ephes dammim
 and saul and the men of israel came together and took up their position in the valley of elah and put their forces in order against the philistines
 the philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and israel on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them
 and a fighter came out from the tents of the philistines named goliath of gath he was more than six cubits tall
 and he had a head dress of brass on his head and he was dressed in a coat of metal the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass
 his legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass
 the stem of his spear was as long as a cloth workers rod and its head was made of six hundred shekels weight of iron and one went before him with his body cover
 he took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of israel why have you come out to make war am i not a philistine and you servants of saul send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
 if he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me then we will be your servants but if i am able to overcome him then you will be our servants and do work for us
 and the philistine said i have put to shame the armies of israel this day give me a man so that we may have a fight together
 and saul and all israel hearing those words of the philistine were troubled and full of fear
 now david was the son of that ephrathite of beth lehem judah named jesse who had eight sons and he was an old man in sauls day and far on in years
 and the three oldest sons of jesse had gone with saul to the fight the names of the three who went to the fight were eliab the oldest and abinadab the second and shammah the third
 and david was the youngest and the three oldest were with sauls army
 now david went to and from saul looking after his fathers sheep at beth lehem
 and the philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days
 and jesse said to his son david take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers
 and take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are
 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines
 and david got up early in the morning and giving the sheep into the care of a keeper took the things and went as jesse had said and he came to the lines where the carts were when the army was going out to the fight giving their war cry
 and israel and the philistines had put their forces in position army against army
 and david gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them
