 as long as we have life we are living to the lord or if we give up our life it is to the lord so if we are living or if our life comes to an end we are the lords
 and for this purpose christ went into death and came back again that he might be the lord of the dead and of the living
 but you why do you make yourself your brothers judge or again why have you no respect for your brother because we will all have to take our place before god as our judge
 for it is said in the holy writings by my life says the lord to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give worship to god
 so every one of us will have to give an account of himself to god
 then let us not be judges of one another any longer but keep this in mind that no man is to make it hard for his brother or give him cause for doubting
 i am conscious of this and am certain in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean for him it is unclean
 and if because of food your brother is troubled then you are no longer going on in the way of love do not let your food be destruction to him for whom christ went into death
 let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good
 for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
 and he who in these things is christs servant is pleasing to god and has the approval of men
 so then let us go after the things which make peace and the things by which we may be a help to one another
 do not let the work of god come to nothing on account of food all things are certainly clean but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another
 it is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother
 the faith which you have have it to yourself before god happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval
 but he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food because he does it not in faith and whatever is not of faith is sin
 we who are strong have to be a support to the feeble and not give pleasure to ourselves
 let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good to make him strong
 for christ did not give pleasure to himself but as it is said the bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me
 now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy writings we might have hope
 now may the god who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with christ jesus
 so that with one mouth you may give glory to the god and father of our lord jesus christ
 so then take one another to your hearts as christ took us to the glory of god
 now i say that christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by god to the fathers
 and so that the gentiles might give glory to god for his mercy as it is said for this reason i will give praise to you among the gentiles and i will make a song to your name
 and again he says take part you gentiles in the joy of his people
 and again give praise to the lord all you gentiles and let all the nations give praise to him
 and again isaiah says there will be the root of jesse and he who comes to be the ruler over the gentiles in him will the gentiles put their hope
 now may the god of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith so that all hope may be yours in the power of the holy spirit
 and i myself am certain of you brothers that you are full of what is good complete in all knowledge able to give direction to one another
