 and he would not but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt
 so when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done
 then his lord sent for him and said you evil servant i made you free of all that debt because of your request to me
 was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant even as i had mercy on you
 and his lord was very angry and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt
 so will my father in heaven do to you if you do not everyone from your hearts give forgiveness to his brother
 and it came about that after saying these words jesus went away from galilee and came into the parts of judaea on the other side of jordan
 and a great number went after him and he made them well there
 and certain pharisees came to him testing him and saying is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause
 and he said in answer have you not seen in the writings that he who made them at the first made them male and female and said
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
 so that they are no longer two but one flesh then let not that which has been joined by god be parted by man
 they say to him why then did moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her
 he says to them moses because of your hard hearts let you put away your wives but it has not been so from the first
 and i say to you whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue and takes another is a false husband and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away is no true husband to her
 the disciples say to him if this is the position of a man in relation to his wife it is better not to be married
 but he said to them not all men are able to take in this saying but only those to whom it is given
 for there are men who from birth were without sex and there are some who were made so by men and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven he who is able to take it let him take it
 then some people took little children to him so that he might put his hands on them in blessing and the disciples said sharp words to them
 but jesus said let the little ones come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
 and he put his hands on them and went away
 and one came to him and said master what good thing have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and he said to him why are you questioning me about what is good one there is who is good but if you have a desire to go into life keep the rules of the law
 he says to him which and jesus said do not put anyone to death do not be untrue in married life do not take what is not yours do not give false witness
 give honour to your father and your mother and have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 the young man says to him all these things have i done what more is there
 jesus said to him if you have a desire to be complete go get money for your property and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
 but hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing for he had much property
 and jesus said to his disciples truly i say to you it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven
 and again i say to you it is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of god
