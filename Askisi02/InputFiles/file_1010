 the birds of the air and the fish of the sea and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas
 o lord our lord how noble is your name in all the earth 
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim eduth of asaph a psalm&gt give ear o keeper of israel guiding joseph like a flock you who have your seat on the winged ones let your glory be seen
 before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh let your strength be awake from sleep and come as our salvation
 take us back again o god let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 o lord god of armies how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people
 you have given them the bread of weeping for food for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure
 you make us a cause of war among our neighbours our haters are laughing at us among themselves
 take us back again o god of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 you took a vine out of egypt driving out the nations and planting it in their land
 you made ready a place for it so that it might take deep root and it sent out its branches over all the land
 the mountains were covered with its shade and the great trees with its branches
 it sent out its arms to the sea and its branches to the river
 why are its walls broken down by your hands so that all who go by may take its fruit
 it is uprooted by the pigs from the woods the beasts of the field get their food from it
 come back o god of armies from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine and give your mind to it
 even to the tree which was planted by your right hand and to the branch which you made strong for yourself
 it is burned with fire it is cut down they are made waste by the wrath of your face
 let your hand be on the man of your right hand on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself
 so will we not be turned back from you keep us in life and we will give praise to your name
 take us back o lord god of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 &ltto the chief music maker put to the gittith of asaph&gt make a song to god our strength make a glad cry to the god of jacob
 take up the melody playing on an instrument of music even on corded instruments
 let the horn be sounded in the time of the new moon at the full moon on our holy feast day
 for this is a rule for israel and a law of the god of jacob
 he gave it to joseph as a witness when he went out over the land of egypt then the words of a strange tongue were sounding in my ears
 i took the weight from his back his hands were made free from the baskets
 you gave a cry in your trouble and i made you free i gave you an answer in the secret place of the thunder i put you to the test at the waters of meribah  selah 
 give ear o my people and i will give you my word o israel if you will only do as i say 
 there is to be no strange god among you you are not to give worship to any other god
