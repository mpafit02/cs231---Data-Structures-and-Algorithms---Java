 she sees that her marketing is of profit to her her light does not go out by night
 she puts her hands to the cloth working rod and her fingers take the wheel
 her hands are stretched out to the poor yes she is open handed to those who are in need
 she has no fear of the snow for her family for all those in her house are clothed in red
 she makes for herself cushions of needlework her clothing is fair linen and purple
 her husband is a man of note in the public place when he takes his seat among the responsible men of the land
 she makes linen robes and gets a price for them and traders take her cloth bands for a price
 strength and self respect are her clothing she is facing the future with a smile
 her mouth is open to give out wisdom and the law of mercy is on her tongue
 she gives attention to the ways of her family she does not take her food without working for it
 her children get up and give her honour and her husband gives her praise saying
 unnumbered women have done well but you are better than all of them
 fair looks are a deceit and a beautiful form is of no value but a woman who has the fear of the lord is to be praised
 give her credit for what her hands have made let her be praised by her works in the public place
 give ear my sons to the teaching of a father give attention so that you may have knowledge
 for i give you good teaching do not give up the knowledge you are getting from me
 for i was a son to my father a gentle and an only one to my mother
 and he gave me teaching saying to me keep my words in your heart keep my rules so that you may have life
 get wisdom get true knowledge keep it in memory do not be turned away from the words of my mouth
 do not give her up and she will keep you give her your love and she will make you safe
 the first sign of wisdom is to get wisdom go give all you have to get true knowledge
 put her in a high place and you will be lifted up by her she will give you honour when you give her your love
 she will put a crown of grace on your head giving you a head dress of glory
 give ear o my son and let your heart be open to my sayings and long life will be yours
 i have given you teaching in the way of wisdom guiding your steps in the straight way
 when you go your way will not be narrow and in running you will not have a fall
 take learning in your hands do not let her go keep her for she is your life
 do not go in the road of sinners or be walking in the way of evil men
 keep far from it do not go near be turned from it and go on your way
 for they take no rest till they have done evil their sleep is taken away if they have not been the cause of someones fall
