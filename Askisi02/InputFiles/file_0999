 &ltto the chief music maker with corded instruments a psalm a song&gt may god give us mercy and blessing and let the light of his face be shining on us  selah 
 so that men may see your way on the earth and your salvation among all nations
 let the peoples give you praise o god let all the peoples give you praise
 o let the nations be glad and make song of joy for you will be the judge of the peoples in righteousness guiding the nations of the earth  selah 
 let the peoples give you praise o god let all the peoples give you praise
 the earth has given her increase and god even our god will give us his blessing
 god will give us his blessing so let all the ends of the earth be in fear of him
 &ltto the chief music maker of david a psalm a song&gt let god be seen and let his haters be put to flight let those who are against him be turned back before him
 let them be like smoke before the driving wind as wax turning soft before the fire so let them come to an end before the power of god
 but let the upright be glad let them have delight before god let them be full of joy
 make songs to god make songs of praise to his name make a way for him who comes through the waste lands his name is jah be glad before him
 a father to those who have no father a judge of the widows is god in his holy place
 those who are without friends god puts in families he makes free those who are in chains but those who are turned away from him are given a dry land
 o god when you went out before your people wandering through the waste land  selah 
 the earth was shaking and the heavens were streaming because god was present even sinai itself was moved before god the god of israel
 you o god did freely send the rain giving strength to the weariness of your heritage
 those whose resting place was there even the poor were comforted by your good things o god
 the lord gives the word great is the number of the women who make it public
 kings of armies quickly go in flight and the women in the houses make a division of their goods
 will you take your rest among the flocks like the wings of a dove covered with silver and its feathers with yellow gold
 when the most high put the kings to flight it was as white as snow in salmon
 a hill of god is the hill of bashan a hill with high tops is the hill of bashan
 why are you looking with envy you high hills on the hill desired by god as his resting place truly god will make it his house for ever
 the war carriage of god is among israels thousands the lord has come from sinai to the holy place
 you have gone up on high taking your prisoners with you you have taken offerings from men the lord god has taken his place on the seat of his power
 praise be to the lord who is our support day by day even the god of our salvation  selah 
 our god is for us a god of salvation his are the ways out of death
 the heads of the haters of god will be crushed even the head of him who still goes on in his evil ways
 the lord said i will make them come back from bashan and from the deep parts of the sea
 so that your foot may be red with blood and the tongues of your dogs with the same
