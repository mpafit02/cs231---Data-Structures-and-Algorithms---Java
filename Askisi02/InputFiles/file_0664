 see the things said before have come about and now i give word of new things before they come i give you news of them
 make a new song to the lord and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth you who go down to the sea and everything in it the sea lands and their people
 let the waste land and its flocks be glad the tent circles of kedar let the people of the rock give a glad cry from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy
 let them give glory to the lord sounding his praise in the sea lands
 the lord will go out as a man of war he will be moved to wrath like a fighting man his voice will be strong he will give a loud cry he will go against his attackers like a man of war
 i have long been quiet i have kept myself in and done nothing now i will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth breathing hard and quickly
 i will make waste mountains and hills drying up all their plants and i will make rivers dry and pools dry land
 and i will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge guiding them by roads strange to them i will make the dark places light before them and the rough places level these things will i do and will not give them up
 they will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images who say to metal images you are our gods
 give ear you whose ears are shut and let your eyes be open you blind so that you may see
 who is blind but my servant who has his ears stopped but he whom i send who is blind as my true one or who has his ears shut like the lords servant
 seeing much but keeping nothing in mind his ears are open but there is no hearing
 it was the lords pleasure because of his righteousness to make the teaching great and give it honour
 but this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force they are all taken in holes and shut up in prisons they are made prisoners and no one makes them free they are taken by force and no one says give them back
 who is there among you who will give ear to this who will give attention to it for the time to come
 who gave up jacob to those who took away his goods and israel to his attackers did not the lord he against whom they did wrong and in whose ways they would not go turning away from his teaching
 for this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath and his strength was like a flame and it put fire round about him but he did not see it he was burned but did not take it to heart
 but now says the lord your maker o jacob and your life giver o israel have no fear for i have taken up your cause naming you by your name i have made you mine
 when you go through the waters i will be with you and through the rivers they will not go over you when you go through the fire you will not be burned and the flame will have no power over you
 for i am the lord your god the holy one of israel your saviour i have given egypt as a price for you ethiopia and seba for you
 because of your value in my eyes you have been honoured and loved by me so i will give men for you and peoples for your life
 have no fear for i am with you i will take your seed from the east and get you together from the west
 i will say to the north give them up and to the south do not keep them back send back my sons from far and my daughters from the end of the earth
 every one who is named by my name and whom i have made for my glory who has been formed and designed by me
 send out the blind people who have eyes and those who have ears but they are shut
 let all the nations come together and let the peoples be present who among them is able to make this clear and give us word of earlier things let their witnesses come forward so that they may be seen to be true and that they may give ear and say it is true
 you are my witnesses says the lord and my servant whom i have taken for myself so that you may see and have faith in me and that it may be clear to you that i am he before me there was no god formed and there will not be after me
 i even i am the lord and there is no saviour but me
 i gave the word and made it clear and there was no strange god among you for this reason you are my witnesses says the lord
 from time long past i am god and from this day i am he there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand when i undertake a thing by whom will my purpose be changed
