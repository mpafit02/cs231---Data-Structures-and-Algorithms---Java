 for the horses of pharaoh with his war carriages and his horsemen went into the sea and the lord sent the waters of the sea back over them but the children of israel went through the sea on dry land
 and miriam the woman prophet the sister of aaron took an instrument of music in her hand and all the women went after her with music and dances
 and miriam answering said make a song to the lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea
 then moses took israel forward from the red sea and they went out into the waste land of shur and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water
 and when they came to marah the water was no good for drinking for the waters of marah were bitter which is why it was named marah
 and the people crying out against moses said what are we to have for drink
 and in answer to his prayer the lord made him see a tree and when he put it into the water the water was made sweet there he gave them a law and an order testing them
 and he said if with all your heart you will give attention to the voice of the lord your god and do what is right in his eyes giving ear to his orders and keeping his laws i will not put on you any of the diseases which i put on the egyptians for i am the lord your life giver
 and they came to elim where there were twelve water springs and seventy palm trees and they put up their tents there by the waters
 and they went on their way from elim and all the children of israel came into the waste land of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they went out of the land of egypt
 and all the children of israel were crying out against moses and aaron in the waste land
 and the children of israel said to them it would have been better for the lord to have put us to death in the land of egypt where we were seated by the flesh pots and had bread enough for our needs for you have taken us out to this waste of sand to put all this people to death through need of food
 then the lord said to moses see i will send down bread from heaven for you and the people will go out every day and get enough for the days needs so that i may put them to the test to see if they will keep my laws or not
 and on the sixth day they are to make ready what they get in and it will be twice as much as they get on the other days
 and moses and aaron said to all the children of israel this evening it will be clear to you that it is the lord who has taken you out of the land of egypt
 and in the morning you will see the glory of the lord for your angry words against the lord have come to his ears and what are we that you are crying out against us
 and moses said the lord will give you meat for your food at evening and in the morning bread in full measure for your outcry against the lord has come to his ears for what are we your outcry is not against us but against the lord
 and moses said to aaron say to all the people of israel come near before the lord for he has given ear to your outcry
 and while aaron was talking to the children of israel their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land and they saw the glory of the lord shining in the cloud
 and the lord said to moses
 the outcry of the children of israel has come to my ears say to them now at nightfall you will have meat for your food and in the morning bread in full measure and you will see that i am the lord your god
 and it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents
 and when the dew was gone on the face of the earth was a small round thing like small drops of ice on the earth
 and when the children of israel saw it they said to one another what is it for they had no idea what it was and moses said to them it is the bread which the lord has given you for your food
 this is what the lord has said let every man take up as much as he has need of at the rate of one omer for every person let every man take as much as is needed for his family
 and the children of israel did so and some took more and some less
 and when it was measured he who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough every man had taken what he was able to make use of
 and moses said to them let nothing be kept till the morning
 but they gave no attention to moses and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell and moses was angry with them
 and they took it up morning by morning every man as he had need and when the sun was high it was gone
