 and we had a dream on the same night the two of us and the dreams had a special sense
 and there was with us a young hebrew the captains servant and when we put our dreams before him he gave us the sense of them
 and it came about as he said i was put back in my place and the bread maker was put to death by hanging
 then pharaoh sent for joseph and they took him quickly out of prison and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed he came before pharaoh
 and pharaoh said to joseph i have had a dream and no one is able to give me the sense of it now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you
 then joseph said without god there will be no answer of peace for pharaoh
 then pharaoh said in my dream i was by the side of the nile
 and out of the nile came seven cows fat and good looking and their food was the river grass
 then after them came seven other cows very thin and poor looking worse than any i ever saw in the land of egypt
 and the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first
 and even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before and so i came out of my sleep
 and again in a dream i saw seven heads of grain full and good coming up on one stem
 and then i saw seven other heads dry thin and wasted by the east wind coming up after them
 and the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads and i put this dream before the wise men but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it
 then joseph said these two dreams have the same sense god has made clear to pharaoh what he is about to do
 the seven fat cows are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the two have the same sense
 the seven thin and poor looking cows who came up after them are seven years and the seven heads of grain dry and wasted by the east wind are seven years when there will be no food
 as i said to pharaoh before god has made clear to him what he is about to do
 seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in egypt
 and after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food and the memory of the good years will go from mens minds and the land will be made waste by the bad years
 and men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after for it will be very bitter
 and this dream came to pharaoh twice because this thing is certain and god will quickly make it come about
 and now let pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense and put him in authority over the land of egypt
 let pharaoh do this and let him put overseers over the land of egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years
 and let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under pharaohs control for the use of the towns and let them keep it
 and let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in egypt so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food
 and this seemed good to pharaoh and to all his servants
 then pharaoh said to his servants where may we get such a man as this a man in whom is the spirit of god
 and pharaoh said to joseph seeing that god has made all this clear to you there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you
 you then are to be over my house and all my people will be ruled by your word only as king will i be greater than you
