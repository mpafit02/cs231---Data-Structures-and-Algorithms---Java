 then the secret was made clear to daniel in a vision of the night and daniel gave blessing to the god of heaven
 and daniel said in answer may the name of god be praised for ever and ever for wisdom and strength are his
 by him times and years are changed by him kings are taken away and kings are lifted up he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those whose minds are awake
 he is the unveiler of deep and secret things he has knowledge of what is in the dark and the light has its living place with him
 i give you praise and worship o god of my fathers who have given me wisdom and strength and have now made clear to me what we were requesting from you for you have given us knowledge of the kings business
 for this reason daniel went to arioch to whom the king had given orders for the destruction of the wise men of babylon and said to him do not put to death the wise men of babylon take me in before the king and i will make clear to him the sense of the dream
 then arioch quickly took daniel in before the king and said to him here is a man from among the prisoners of judah who will make clear to the king the sense of the dream
 the king made answer and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar are you able to make clear to me the dream which i saw and its sense
 then daniel said in answer to the king no wise men or users of secret arts or wonder workers or readers of signs are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for
 but there is a god in heaven the unveiler of secrets and he has given to king nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these
 as for you o king the thoughts which came to you on your bed were of what will come about after this and the unveiler of secrets has made clear to you what is to come
 as for me this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which i have more than any living man but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king and that you may have knowledge of the thoughts of your heart
 you o king were looking and a great image was there this image which was very great and whose glory was very bright was placed before you its form sent fear into the heart
 as for this image its head was made of the best gold its breast and its arms were of silver its middle and its sides were of brass
 its legs of iron its feet were in part of iron and in part of potters earth
 while you were looking at it a stone was cut out but not by hands and it gave the image a blow on its feet which were of iron and earth and they were broken in bits
 then the iron and the earth the brass and the silver and the gold were smashed together and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be seen and the stone which gave the image a blow became a great mountain covering all the earth
 this is the dream and we will make clear to the king the sense of it
 you o king king of kings to whom the god of heaven has given the kingdom the power and the strength and the glory
 wherever the children of men are living into whose hands he has given the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and has made you ruler over them all you are the head of gold
 and after you another kingdom lower than you will come to power and a third kingdom of brass ruling over all the earth
 and the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron because as all things are broken and overcome by iron so it will have the power of crushing and smashing down all the earth
 and as you saw the feet and toes part of potters work and part of iron there will be a division in the kingdom but there will be some of the strength of iron in it because you saw the iron mixed with the potters earth
 and as the toes of the feet were in part of iron and in part of earth so part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will readily be broken
 and as you saw the iron mixed with earth they will give their daughters to one another as wives but they will not be united one with another even as iron is not mixed with earth
 and in the days of those kings the god of heaven will put up a kingdom which will never come to destruction and its power will never be given into the hands of another people and all these kingdoms will be broken and overcome by it but it will keep its place for ever
 because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that by it the iron and the brass and the earth and the silver and the gold were broken to bits a great god has given the king knowledge of what is to take place in the future the dream is fixed and its sense is certain
 then king nebuchadnezzar falling down on his face gave worship to daniel and gave orders for an offering and spices to be given to him
 and the king made answer to daniel and said truly your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and an unveiler of secrets for you have been able to make this secret clear
 then the king made daniel great and gave him offerings in great number and made him ruler over all the land of babylon and chief over all the wise men of babylon
