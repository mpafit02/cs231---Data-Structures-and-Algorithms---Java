 and the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care because the lord was with him and the lord made everything he did go well
 and the man had connection with eve his wife and she became with child and gave birth to cain and said i have got a man from the lord
 then again she became with child and gave birth to abel his brother and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a farmer
 and after a time cain gave to the lord an offering of the fruits of the earth
 and abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat and the lord was pleased with abels offering
 but in cain and his offering he had no pleasure and cain was angry and his face became sad
 and the lord said to cain why are you angry and why is your face sad
 if you do well will you not have honour and if you do wrong sin is waiting at the door desiring to have you but do not let it be your master
 and cain said to his brother let us go into the field and when they were in the field cain made an attack on his brother abel and put him to death
 and the lord said to cain where is your brother abel and he said i have no idea am i my brothers keeper
 and he said what have you done the voice of your brothers blood is crying to me from the earth
 and now you are cursed from the earth whose mouth is open to take your brothers blood from your hand
 no longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth
 and cain said my punishment is greater than my strength
 you have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face i will be a wanderer in flight over the earth and whoever sees me will put me to death
 and the lord said truly if cain is put to death seven lives will be taken for his and the lord put a mark on cain so that no one might put him to death
 and cain went away from before the face of the lord and made his living place in the land of nod on the east of eden
 and cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to enoch and he made a town and gave the town the name of enoch after his son
 and enoch had a son irad and irad became the father of mehujael and mehujael became the father of methushael and methushael became the father of lamech

 and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all players on instruments of music
 and zillah gave birth to tubal cain who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron and the sister of tubal cain was naamah
 and lamech said to his wives adah and zillah give ear to my voice you wives of lamech give attention to my words for i would put a man to death for a wound and a young man for a blow
 if seven lives are to be taken as punishment for cains death seventy seven will be taken for lamechs
 and adam had connection with his wife again and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of seth for she said god has given me another seed in place of abel whom cain put to death
 and seth had a son and he gave him the name of enosh at this time men first made use of the name of the lord in worship
 now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine and the chief bread maker in pharaohs house did something against pharaohs orders
 and pharaoh was angry with his two servants with the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker
 and he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army in the same prison where joseph himself was shut up
