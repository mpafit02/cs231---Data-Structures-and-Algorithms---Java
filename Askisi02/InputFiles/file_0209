 and the disciples hearing this were greatly surprised saying who then may have salvation
 and jesus looking at them said with men this is not possible but with god all things are possible
 then peter said to him see we have given up everything and have come after you what then will we have
 and jesus said to them truly i say to you that in the time when all things are made new and the son of man is seated in his glory you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of israel
 and everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or child or land for my name will be given a hundred times as much and have eternal life
 but a great number who are first will be last and some who are last will be first
 now when the birth of jesus took place in beth lehem of judaea in the days of herod the king there came wise men from the east to jerusalem
 saying where is the king of the jews whose birth has now taken place we have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship
 and when it came to the ears of herod the king he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
 and he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people questioning them as to where the birth place of the christ would be
 and they said to him in beth lehem of judaea for so it is said in the writings of the prophet
 you beth lehem in the land of judah are not the least among the chiefs of judah out of you will come a ruler who will be the keeper of my people israel
 then herod sent for the wise men privately and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen
 and he sent them to beth lehem and said go and make certain where the young child is and when you have seen him let me have news of it so that i may come and give him worship
 and after hearing the king they went on their way and the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came to rest over the place where the young child was
 and when they saw the star they were full of joy
 and they came into the house and saw the young child with mary his mother and falling down on their faces they gave him worship and from their store they gave him offerings of gold perfume and spices
 and it was made clear to them by god in a dream that they were not to go back to herod so they went into their country by another way
 and when they had gone an angel of the lord came to joseph in a dream saying get up and take the young child and his mother and go into egypt and do not go from there till i give you word for herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death
 so he took the young child and his mother by night and went into egypt
 and was there till the death of herod so that the word of the lord through the prophet might come true out of egypt have i sent for my son
 then herod when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men was very angry and he sent out and put to death all the male children in beth lehem and in all the parts round about it from two years old and under acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men
 then the word of jeremiah the prophet came true
 in ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow rachel weeping for her children and she would not be comforted for their loss
 but when herod was dead an angel of the lord came in a dream to joseph in egypt
 saying get up and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel because they who were attempting to take the young childs life are dead
 and he got up and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel
 but when it came to his ears that archelaus was ruling over judaea in the place of his father herod he was in fear of going there and god having given him news of the danger in a dream he went out of the way into the country parts of galilee
 and he came and was living in a town named nazareth so that the word of the prophets might come true he will be named a nazarene
 for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine garden
