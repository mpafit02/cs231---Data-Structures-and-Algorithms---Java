 these words came to the ears of the pharisees who were with him and they said to him are we then blind
 jesus said to them if you were blind you would have no sin but now that you say we see your sin is there still
 jude a servant of jesus christ and the brother of james to those of gods selection who have been made holy by god the father and are kept safe for jesus christ
 may mercy and peace and love be increased in you
 my loved ones while my thoughts were full of a letter which i was going to send you about our common salvation it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever
 for certain men have come among you secretly marked out before in the holy writings for this evil fate men without the fear of god turning his grace into an unclean thing and false to our only master and lord jesus christ
 now it is my purpose to put you in mind though you once had knowledge of all these things of how the lord having taken a people safely out of egypt later sent destruction on those who had no faith
 and the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging
 even as sodom and gomorrah and the towns near them having like these given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh have been made an example undergoing the punishment of eternal fire
 in the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean having no respect for authorities and say evil of rulers
 now when michael one of the chief angels was fighting against the evil one for the body of moses fearing to make use of violent words against him he only said may the lord be your judge
 but these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of and the things of which they have natural knowledge like beasts without reason are the cause of their destruction
 a curse on them  they have gone in the way of cain running uncontrolled into the error of balaam for reward and have come to destruction by saying evil against the lord like korah
 these men are unseen rocks at your love feasts when they take part in them with you keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep clouds without water rushing before the wind wasted trees without fruit twice dead pulled up by the roots
 violent waves of the sea streaming with their shame wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever
 the prophet enoch who was the seventh after adam said of these men the lord came with tens of thousands of his saints
 to be the judge of all and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him because of the evil acts which they have done and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of god have said against him
 these are the men who make trouble ever desiring change going after evil pleasures using high sounding words respecting mens position in the hope of reward
 but you my loved ones keep in memory the words which were said before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
 how they said to you in the last days there will be men who guided by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
 these are the men who make divisions natural men not having the spirit
 but you my loved ones building yourselves up on your most holy faith and making prayers in the holy spirit
 keep yourselves in the love of god looking for life eternal through the mercy of our lord jesus christ
 and have pity on those who are in doubt
 and to some give salvation pulling them out of the fire and on some have mercy with fear hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh
 now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to give you a place in his glory free from all evil with great joy
 to the only god our saviour through jesus christ our lord let us give glory and honour and authority and power before all time and now and for ever so be it
 as a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us
 as they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word
 it seemed good to me having made observation with great care of the direction of events in their order to put the facts in writing for you most noble theophilus
