 because of this my spirit is overcome and my heart is full of fear
 i keep in mind the early days of the past giving thought to all your acts even to the work of your hands
 my hands are stretched out to you my soul is turned to you like a land in need of water  selah 
 be quick in answering me o lord for the strength of my spirit is gone let me see your face so that i may not be like those who go down into the underworld
 let the story of your mercy come to me in the morning for my hope is in you give me knowledge of the way in which i am to go for my soul is lifted up to you
 o lord take me out of the hands of my haters my soul is waiting for you
 give me teaching so that i may do your pleasure for you are my god let your good spirit be my guide into the land of righteousness
 give me life o lord because of your name in your righteousness take my soul out of trouble
 and in your mercy put an end to my haters and send destruction on all those who are against my soul for i am your servant
 &lta psalm of david&gt praise be to the god of my strength teaching my hands the use of the sword and my fingers the art of fighting
 he is my strength and my rock my high tower and my saviour my keeper and my hope he gives me authority over my people
 lord what is man that you keep him in mind or the son of man that you take him into account
 man is like a breath his life is like a shade which is quickly gone
 come down o lord from your heavens at your touch let the mountains give out smoke
 with your storm flames send them in flight send out your arrows for their destruction
 put out your hand from on high make me free take me safely out of the great waters and out of the hands of strange men
 in whose mouths are false words and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit
 i will make a new song to you o god i will make melody to you on an instrument of ten cords
 it is god who gives salvation to kings and who kept his servant david from the wounding sword
 make me free and take me out of the hands of strange men in whose mouths are false words and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit
 our sons are like tall young plants and our daughters like the shining stones of a kings house
 our store houses are full of all good things and our sheep give birth to thousands and ten thousands in our fields
 our oxen are well weighted down our cows give birth safely there is no going out and there is no cry of sorrow in our open places
 happy is the nation whose ways are so ordered yes happy is the nation whose god is the lord
 &lta song of praise of david&gt let me give glory to you o god my king and blessing to your name for ever and ever
 every day will i give you blessing praising your name for ever and ever
 great is the lord and greatly to be praised his power may never be searched out
 one generation after another will give praise to your great acts and make clear the operation of your strength
 my thoughts will be of the honour and glory of your rule and of the wonder of your works
 men will be talking of the power and fear of your acts i will give word of your glory
