 and he said to them when you say your prayers say father may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come
 give us every day bread for our needs
 may we have forgiveness for our sins as we make free all those who are in debt to us and let us not be put to the test
 and he said to them which of you having a friend would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him friend let me have three cakes of bread
 because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey and i have nothing to put before him
 and he from inside the house would say in answer do not be a trouble to me the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed it is not possible for me to get up and give to you
 i say to you though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend still if he keeps on making his request he will get up and give him as much as he has need of
 and i say to you make requests and they will be answered what you are searching for you will get when you give the sign the door will be open to you
 for to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
 and which of you being a father will give a stone to his son who makes request for bread or for a fish will give him a snake
 or for an egg will give him a scorpion
 if then you who are evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your father in heaven give the holy spirit to those who make request to him
 and he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking and it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking and the people were full of wonder
 but some of them said he sends out evil spirits by beelzebul the ruler of evil spirits
 and others testing him were looking for a sign from heaven from him
 but he having knowledge of their thoughts said to them every kingdom in which there is division is made waste and a house in which there is division comes to destruction
 if then satan is at war with himself how will he keep his kingdom because you say that i send evil spirits out of men by the help of beelzebul
 and if i by beelzebul send out evil spirits by whose help do your sons send them out so let them be your judges
 but if i by the finger of god send out evil spirits then the kingdom of god has overtaken you
 when the strong man armed keeps watch over his house then his goods are safe
 but when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him he takes away his instruments of war in which he had put his faith and makes division of his goods
 he who is not with me is against me and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away
 the unclean spirit when he has gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and when he does not get it he says i will go back to my house from which i came
 and when he comes he sees that it has been made fair and clean
 then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself and they go in and take their places there and the last condition of that man is worse than the first
 and it came about that when he said these things a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice happy is the body which gave you birth and the breasts from which you took milk
 but he said more happy are they who give hearing to the word of god and keep it
 and when a great number of people came together to him he said this generation is an evil generation it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of jonah
 for even as jonah became a sign to the ninevites so will the son of man be to this generation
 the queen of the south will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of solomon and now something greater than solomon is here
