 and while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him
 and when he came near the foot of the mountain of olives all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to god with joy because of all the great works which they had seen
 saying a blessing on the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
 and some of the pharisees among the people said to him master make your disciples be quiet
 and he said in answer i say to you if these men keep quiet the very stones will be crying out
 and when he got near and saw the town he was overcome with weeping for it
 saying if you even you had knowledge today of the things which give peace  but you are not able to see them
 for the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you and come all round you and keep you in on every side
 and will make you level with the earth and your children with you and there will not be one stone resting on another in you because you did not see that it was your day of mercy
 and he went into the temple and put out those who were trading there
 saying to them it has been said my house is to be a house of prayer but you have made it a hole of thieves
 and every day he was teaching in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death
 but they were not able to do anything because the people all kept near him being greatly interested in his words
 now it came about in those days that an order went out from caesar augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world
 this was the first numbering which was made when quirinius was ruler of syria
 and all men went to be numbered everyone to his town
 and joseph went up from galilee out of the town of nazareth into judaea to beth lehem the town of david because he was of the house and family of david
 to be put on the list with mary his future wife who was about to become a mother
 and while they were there the time came for her to give birth
 and she had her first son and folding him in linen she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food because there was no room for them in the house
 and in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields watching over their flock by night
 and an angel of the lord came to them and the glory of the lord was shining round about them and fear came on them
 and the angel said have no fear for truly i give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people
 for on this day in the town of david a saviour has come to birth who is christ the lord
 and this is the sign to you you will see a young child folded in linen in the place where the cattle have their food
 and suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven giving praise to god and saying
 glory to god in the highest and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased
 and when the angels had gone away from them into heaven the keepers of the sheep said to one another let us go now to beth lehem and see this thing which has come about which the lord has made clear to us
 and they came quickly and saw mary and joseph and the child in the place where the cattle had their food
 and when they saw it they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child
