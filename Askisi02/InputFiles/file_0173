 but turning round he said sharp words to them
 and they went to another small town
 and when they were on the way a certain man said to him i will come after you wherever you go
 and jesus said to him foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting places but the son of man has nowhere to put his head
 and he said to another come after me but he said lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
 but he said to him let the dead take care of their dead it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of god
 and another man said i will come with you lord but first let me say a last good day to those who are at my house
 but jesus said no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is good enough for the kingdom of god
 the first words of the good news of jesus christ the son of god
 even as it is said in the book of isaiah the prophet see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way
 the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 john came and gave baptism in the waste land preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
 and there went out to him all the people of judaea and all those of jerusalem and they were given baptism by him in the river jordan saying that they were sinners
 and john was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
 and he said to them all there is one coming after me who is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to undo
 i have given you baptism with water but he will give you baptism with the holy spirit
 and it came about in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was given baptism by john in the jordan
 and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens broken open and the spirit coming down on him as a dove
 and a voice came out of heaven you are my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and straight away the spirit sent him out into the waste land
 and he was in the waste land for forty days being tested by satan and he was with the beasts and the angels took care of him
 now after john had been put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the good news of god
 and saying the time has come and the kingdom of god is near let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news
 and going by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
 and jesus said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
 and they went straight from their nets and came after him
 and going on a little farther he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who were in their boat stitching up their nets
 and he said come after me and they went away from their father zebedee who was in the boat with the servants and came after him
 and they came to capernaum and on the sabbath he went into the synagogue and gave teaching
 and they were full of wonder at his teaching because he gave it as one having authority and not like the scribes
