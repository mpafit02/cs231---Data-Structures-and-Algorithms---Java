 and at daniels request the king gave shadrach meshach and abed nego authority over the business of the land of babylon but daniel was kept near the kings person
 nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold sixty cubits high and six cubits wide he put it up in the valley of dura in the land of babylon
 and nebuchadnezzar the king sent to get together all the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country to come to see the unveiling of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
 then the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country came together to see the unveiling of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up and they took their places before the image which nebuchadnezzar had put up
 then one of the kings criers said in a loud voice to you the order is given o peoples nations and languages
 that when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to your ears you are to go down on your faces in worship before the image of gold which nebuchadnezzar the king has put up
 and anyone not falling down and worshipping will that same hour be put into a burning and flaming fire
 so at that time all the people when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery and all sorts of instruments came to their ears went down on their faces in worship before the image of gold which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
 at that time certain chaldaeans came near and made a statement against the jews
 they made answer and said to nebuchadnezzar the king o king have life for ever
 you o king have given an order that every man when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to his ears is to go down on his face in worship before the image of gold
 and anyone not falling down and worshipping is to be put into a burning and flaming fire
 there are certain jews whom you have put over the business of the land of babylon shadrach meshach and abed nego these men have not given attention to you o king they are not servants of your gods or worshippers of the gold image which you have put up
 then nebuchadnezzar in his wrath and passion gave orders for shadrach meshach and abed nego to be sent for then they made these men come in before the king
 nebuchadnezzar made answer and said to them is it true o shadrach meshach and abed nego that you will not be servants of my god or give worship to the image of gold which i have put up
 now if you are ready on hearing the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments to go down on your faces in worship before the image which i have made it is well but if you will not give worship that same hour you will be put into a burning and flaming fire and what god is there who will be able to take you out of my hands
 shadrach meshach and abed nego answering nebuchadnezzar the king said there is no need for us to give you an answer to this question
 if our god whose servants we are is able to keep us safe from the burning and flaming fire and from your hands o king he will keep us safe
 but if not be certain o king that we will not be the servants of your gods or give worship to the image of gold which you have put up
 then nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath and the form of his face was changed against shadrach meshach and abed nego and he gave orders that the fire was to be heated up seven times more than it was generally heated
 and he gave orders to certain strong men in his army to put cords on shadrach meshach and abed nego and put them into the burning and flaming fire
 then these men had cords put round them as they were in their coats their trousers their hats and their clothing and were dropped into the burning and flaming fire
 and because the kings order was not to be put on one side and the heat of the fire was so great the men who took up shadrach meshach and abed nego were burned to death by the flame of the fire
 and these three men shadrach meshach and abed nego with the cords about them went down into the burning and flaming fire
 then king nebuchadnezzar full of fear and wonder got up quickly and said to his wise men did we not put three men in cords into the fire and they made answer and said to the king true o king
 he made answer and said look  i see four men loose walking in the middle of the fire and they are not damaged and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods
 then nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning and flaming fire he made answer and said shadrach meshach and abed nego you servants of the most high god come out and come here then shadrach meshach and abed nego came out of the fire
 and the captains the chiefs and the rulers and the kings wise men who had come together saw these men over whose bodies the fire had no power and not a hair of their heads was burned and their coats were not changed and there was no smell of fire about them
 nebuchadnezzar made answer and said praise be to the god of shadrach meshach and abed nego who has sent his angel and kept his servants safe who had faith in him and who put the kings word on one side and gave up their bodies to the fire so that they might not be servants or worshippers of any other god but their god
 and it is my decision that any people nation or language saying evil against the god of shadrach meshach and abed nego will be cut to bits and their houses made waste because there is no other god who is able to give salvation such as this
