 simon simon satan has made a request to have you so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested
 but i have made prayer for you that your faith may not go from you and when you are turned again make your brothers strong
 and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death
 and he said i say to you peter before the cocks second cry today you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 and he said to them when i sent you out without money or bag or shoes were you in need of anything and they said nothing
 and he said to them but now he who has a money bag or a bag for food let him take it and he who has not let him give his coat for money and get a sword
 for i say to you that these words will be put into effect in me and he was numbered among the evil doers for what has been said in the writings about me has an end
 and they said lord here are two swords and he said it is enough
 and he came out and went as his way was to the mountain of olives and the disciples went with him
 and when he came to the place he said to them make a prayer that you may not be put to the test
 and he went a little distance away from them and falling on his knees in prayer he said
 father if it is your pleasure take this cup from me but still let your pleasure not mine be done
 and an angel from heaven came to him to give him strength
 and being in great trouble of soul the force of his prayer became stronger and great drops like blood came from him falling to the earth
 and getting up from prayer he came to the disciples and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow
 and he said why are you sleeping get up and give yourselves to prayer so that you may not be put to the test
 and while he was saying these words there came a band of people and judas one of the twelve was in front of them and he came near to jesus to give him a kiss
 but jesus said to him judas will you be false to the son of man with a kiss
 and when those who were with him saw what was coming they said lord may we not make use of our swords
 and one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest cutting off his right ear
 but jesus answering said put up with this at least and touching his ear he made it well
 and jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the temple and the rulers who had come against him have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks
 when i was in the temple with you every day your hands were not stretched out against me but this is your hour and the authority of the dark power
 and they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest but peter went after them at a distance
 and a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square and they were seated together and peter was among them
 and a certain woman servant seeing him in the light of the fire and looking at him with attention said this man was with him
 but he said woman it is not true i have no knowledge of him
 and after a little time another saw him and said you are one of them and he said man i am not
 and after about an hour another man said with decision certainly this man was with him for he is a galilaean
 and peter said man i have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking and straight away while he was saying these words there came the cry of a cock
