 and after the birth of terah nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years and had sons and daughters
 and terah was seventy years old when he became the father of abram nahor and haran
 these are the generations of terah terah was the father of abram nahor and haran and haran was the father of lot
 and death came to haran when he was with his father terah in the land of his birth ur of the chaldees
 and abram and nahor took wives for themselves the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife was milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and iscah
 and sarai had no child
 and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran and sarai his daughter in law the wife of his son abram and they went out from ur of the chaldees to go to the land of canaan and they came to haran and were there for some time
 and all the years of terahs life were two hundred and five and terah came to his end in haran
 now the lord said to abram go out from your country and from your family and from your fathers house into the land to which i will be your guide
 and i will make of you a great nation blessing you and making your name great and you will be a blessing
 to them who are good to you will i give blessing and on him who does you wrong will i put my curse and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
 so abram went as the lord had said to him and lot went with him abram was seventy five years old when he went away from haran
 and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their goods and the servants which they had got in haran and they went out to go to the land of canaan
 and abram went through the land till he came to shechem to the holy tree of moreh at that time the canaanites were still living in the land
 and the lord came to abram and said i will give all this land to your seed then abram made an altar there to the lord who had let himself be seen by him
 and moving on from there to the mountain on the east of beth el he put up his tent having beth el on the west and ai on the east and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the lord
 and he went on journeying still to the south
 and because there was little food to be had in that land he went down into egypt
 now when he came near to egypt he said to sarai his wife truly you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye
 and i am certain that when the men of egypt see you they will say this is his wife and they will put me to death and keep you
 say then that you are my sister and so it will be well with me because of you and my life will be kept safe on your account
 and so it was that when abram came into egypt the men of egypt looking on the woman saw that she was fair
 and pharaohs great men having seen her said words in praise of her to pharaoh and she was taken into pharaohs house
 and because of her he was good to abram and he had sheep and oxen and asses and men servants and women servants and camels
 and the lord sent great troubles on pharaohs house because of sarai abrams wife
 then pharaoh sent for abram and said what have you done to me why did you not say that she was your wife
 why did you say that she was your sister so that i took her for my wife now take your wife and go on your way
 and pharaoh gave orders to his men and they sent him on his way with his wife and all he had
 and abram went up out of egypt with his wife and all he had and lot with him and they came in to the south
 now abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold
