 and the lord gave me knowledge of it and i saw it then you made clear to me their doings
 but i was like a gentle lamb taken to be put to death i had no thought that they were designing evil against me saying come and let us make trouble his food cutting him off from the land of the living so that there may be no more memory of his name
 but o lord of armies judging in righteousness testing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for i have put my cause before you
 so this is what the lord of armies has said about the men of anathoth who have made designs against your life saying you are not to be a prophet in the name of the lord or death will overtake you by our hands
 so the lord of armies has said see i will send punishment on them the young men will be put to the sword their sons and their daughters will come to death through need of food
 not one of them will keep his life for i will send evil on the men of anathoth in the year of their punishment
 you are in the right o lord when i put my cause before you still let me take up with you the question of your decisions why does the evil doer do well why are the workers of deceit living in comfort
 they have been planted by you they have taken root they go on and give fruit you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts
 but you o lord have knowledge of me you see me searching and testing how my heart is with you let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death make them ready for the day of death
 how long will the land have grief and the plants of all the land be dry because of the sins of the people living in it destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds because they said god does not see our ways
 if running with the fighting men has made you tired how will you be able to keep up with horses and if in a land of peace you go in flight what will become of you in the thick growth of jordan
 for even your brothers your fathers family even they have been untrue to you crying loudly after you have no faith in them though they say fair words to you
 i have given up my house i have let my heritage go i have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters
 my heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me her voice has been loud against me so i have hate for her
 my heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me the cruel birds are attacking her on every side go get together all the beasts of the field make them come for destruction
 the keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vine garden crushing my heritage under their feet they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste
 they have made it waste it is weeping to me being wasted all the land is made waste because no man takes it to heart
 those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land for the sword of the lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land no flesh has peace
 though good grain was planted they have got in thorns they have given themselves pain without profit they will be shamed on account of their produce because of the burning wrath of the lord
 this is what the lord has said against all my evil neighbours who put their hands on the heritage which i gave my people israel see i will have them uprooted from their land uprooting the people of judah from among them
 and it will come about that after they have been uprooted i will again have pity on them and i will take them back every man to his heritage and every man to his land
 and it will be that if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people using my name in their oaths by the living lord as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the baal then their place will be made certain among my people
 but if they will not give ear then i will have that nation uprooted and given to destruction says the lord
 this is what the lord said to me go and get yourself a linen band and put it round you and do not put it in water
 so as the lord said i got a band for a price and put it round my body
 and the word of the lord came to me a second time saying
 take the band which you got for a price which is round your body and go to parah and put it in a secret place there in a hole of the rock
 so i went and put it in a secret place by parah as the lord had said to me
 then after a long time the lord said to me up  go to parah and get the band which i gave you orders to put there
 so i went to parah and uncovering the hole took the band from the place where i had put it away and the band was damaged and of no use for anything
