 to whom i gave answer that it is not the roman way to give a man up till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him
 so when they had come together here straight away on the day after i took my place on the judges seat and sent for the man
 but when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as i had in mind
 but had certain questions against him in connection with their religion and about one jesus now dead who paul said was living
 and as i had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things i made the suggestion to him to go to jerusalem and be judged there
 but when paul made a request that he might be judged by caesar i gave orders for him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
 and agrippa said to festus i have a desire to give the man a hearing myself tomorrow he said you may give him a hearing
 so on the day after when agrippa and bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town at the order of festus paul was sent for
 and festus said king agrippa and all those who are present here with us you see this man about whom all the jews have made protests to me at jerusalem and in this place saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer
 but in my opinion there is no cause of death in him and as he himself has made a request to be judged by caesar i have said that i would send him
 but i have no certain account of him to send to caesar so i have sent for him to come before you and specially before you king agrippa so that after the business has been gone into i may have something to put in writing
 for it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him
 and agrippa said to paul you may put your cause before us then paul stretching out his hand made his answer saying
 in my opinion i am happy king agrippa to be able to give my answer before you today to all these things which the jews say against me
 the more so because you are expert in all questions to do with the jews and their ways so i make my request to you to give me a hearing to the end
 all the jews have knowledge of my way of life from my early years as it was from the start among my nation and at jerusalem
 and they are able to say if they would give witness that i was living as a pharisee in that division of our religion which is most regular in the keeping of the law
 and now i am here to be judged because of the hope given by gods word to our fathers
 for the effecting of which our twelve tribes have been working and waiting night and day with all their hearts and in connection with this hope i am attacked by the jews o king 
 why in your opinion is it outside belief for god to make the dead come to life again
 for i truly was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of jesus of nazareth
 and this i did in jerusalem and numbers of the saints i put in prison having had authority given to me from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my decision against them
 and i gave them punishment frequently in all the synagogues forcing them to say things against god and burning with passion against them i went after them even into far away towns
 then when i was journeying to damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests
 in the middle of the day on the road i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining round me and those who were journeying with me
 and when we had all gone down on the earth a voice came to me saying in the hebrew language saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly it is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you
 and i said who are you lord and the lord said i am jesus whom you are attacking
 but get up on your feet for i have come to you for this purpose to make you a servant and a witness of the things in which you have seen me and of those in which you will see me
 and i will keep you safe from the people and from the gentiles to whom i send you
 to make their eyes open turning them from the dark to the light and from the power of satan to god so that they may have forgiveness of sins and a heritage among those who are made holy by faith in me
