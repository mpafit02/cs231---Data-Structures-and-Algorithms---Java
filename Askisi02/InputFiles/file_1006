 gone is the wealth of the strong their last sleep has overcome them the men of war have become feeble
 at the voice of your wrath o god of jacob deep sleep has overcome carriage and horse
 you you are to be feared who may keep his place before you in the time of your wrath
 from heaven you gave your decision the earth in its fear gave no sound
 when god took his place as judge for the salvation of the poor on the earth  selah 
 the  will give you praise the rest of 
 give to the lord your god what is his by right let all who are round him give offerings to him who is to be feared
 he puts an end to the wrath of rulers he is feared by the kings of the earth
 &ltto the chief music maker after jeduthun of asaph a psalm&gt i was crying to god with my voice even to god with my voice and he gave ear to me
 in the day of my trouble my heart was turned to the lord my hand was stretched out in the night without resting my soul would not be comforted
 i will keep god in memory with sounds of grief my thoughts are troubled and my spirit is overcome  selah 
 you keep my eyes from sleep i am so troubled that no words come
 my thoughts go back to the days of the past to the years which are gone
 the memory of my song comes back to me in the night my thoughts are moving in my heart my spirit is searching with care
 will the lord put me away for ever will he be kind no longer
 is his mercy quite gone for ever has his word come to nothing
 has god put away the memory of his pity are his mercies shut up by his wrath  selah 
 and i said it is a weight on my spirit but i will keep in mind the years of the right hand of the most high
 i will keep in mind the works of jah i will keep the memory of your wonders in the past
 i will give thought to all your work while my mind goes over your acts of power
 your way o god is holy what god is so great as our god
 you are the god who does works of power you have made your strength clear to the nations
 with your arm you have made your people free the sons of jacob and joseph  selah 
 the waters saw you o god the waters saw you they were in fear even the deep was troubled
 the clouds sent out water the skies gave out a sound truly your arrows went far and wide
 the voice of your thunder went rolling on the world was flaming with the light of the storm the earth was shaking
 your way was in the sea and your road in the great waters there was no knowledge of your footsteps
 you were guiding your people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron
 &ltmaschil of asaph&gt give ear o my people to my law let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth
 opening my mouth i will give out a story even the dark sayings of old times
