 and they were not able to get anything from these words before the people but they were full of wonder at his answer and said nothing
 and some of the sadducees came to him who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they said to him
 master moses said that if a mans brother comes to his end having a wife but no children his brother is to take the wife and get a family for his brother
 now there were seven brothers and the first had a wife and came to his end having no children
 and the second
 and the third took her and in the same way all the seven without having any children came to their end
 and last of all the woman came to her end
 when they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for all the seven had her
 and jesus said to them the sons of this world are married and have wives
 but those to whom is given the reward of the world to come and to come back from the dead have no wives and are not married
 and death has no more power over them for they are equal to the angels and are sons of god being of those who will come back from the dead
 but even moses made it clear that the dead come back to life saying in the story of the burning thorn tree the lord the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
 now he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all men are living to him
 and some of the scribes in answer to this said master you have said well
 and they had fear of putting any more questions to him
 and he said to them why do they say that the christ is the son of david
 for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord take your seat at my right hand
 till i put under your feet all those who are against you
 david then gives him the name of lord so how is it possible for him to be his son
 and in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
 keep away from the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and to have words of respect said to them in the market places and to take the chief seats in the synagogues and the first places at feasts
 who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers they will get a greater punishment
 and looking up he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the money box
 and he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing
 and he said truly i say to you this poor widow has given more than all of them
 for they gave out of their wealth having more than enough for themselves but she even out of her need has put in all her living
 and some were talking about the temple how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings but he said
 as for these things which you see the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another but all will be broken down
 and they said to him master when will these things be and what sign will there be when these events are to take place
 and he said take care that you are not tricked for a number of people will come in my name saying i am he and the time is near do not go after them
