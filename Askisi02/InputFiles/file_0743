 for what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off when god takes back his soul
 will his cry come to the ears of god when he is in trouble
 will he take delight in the ruler of all and make his prayer to god at all times
 i will give you teaching about the hand of god i will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the ruler of all
 truly you have all seen it yourselves why then have you become completely foolish
 this is the punishment of the evil doer from god and the heritage given to the cruel by the ruler of all
 if his children are increased it is for the sword and his offspring have not enough bread
 when those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease they are not put into the earth and their widows are not weeping for them
 though he may get silver together like dust and make ready great stores of clothing
 he may get them ready but the upright will put them on and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage
 his house has no more strength than a spiders thread or a watchmans tent
 he goes to rest full of wealth but does so for the last time on opening his eyes he sees it there no longer
 fears overtake him like rushing waters in the night the storm wind takes him away
 the east wind takes him up and he is gone he is forced violently out of his place
 god sends his arrows against him without mercy he goes in flight before his hand
 men make signs of joy because of him driving him from his place with sounds of hissing
 truly there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is washed out
 iron is taken out of the earth and stone is changed into brass by the fire
 man puts an end to the dark searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark
 he makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day when they go about on the earth they have no knowledge of those who are under them who are hanging far from men twisting from side to side on a cord
 as for the earth bread comes out of it but under its face it is turned up as if by fire
 its stones are the place of sapphires and it has dust of gold
 no bird has knowledge of it and the hawks eye has never seen it
 the great beasts have not gone over it and the cruel lion has not taken that way
 man puts out his hand on the hard rock overturning mountains by the roots
 he makes deep ways cut through the rock and his eye sees everything of value
 he keeps back the streams from flowing and makes the secret things come out into the light
 but where may wisdom be seen and where is the resting place of knowledge
 man has not seen the way to it and it is not in the land of the living
 the deep waters say it is not in me and the sea says it is not with me
