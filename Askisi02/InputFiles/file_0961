 see  this is the blessing of the worshipper of the lord
 may the lord send you blessing out of zion may you see the good of jerusalem all the days of your life
 may you see your childrens children peace be on israel
 &lta song of the going up&gt great have been my troubles from the time when i was young  let israel now say 
 great have been my troubles from the time when i was young but my troubles have not overcome me
 the ploughmen were ploughing on my back long were the wounds they made
 the lord is true the cords of the evil doers are broken in two
 let all the haters of zion be shamed and turned back
 let them be like the grass on the house tops which is dry before it comes to full growth
 he who gets in the grain has no use for it and they do not make bands of it for the grain stems
 and those who go by do not say the blessing of the lord be on you we give you blessing in the name of the lord
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt will you for ever put me out of your memory o lord will your face for ever be turned away from me
 how long is my soul to be in doubt with sorrow in my heart all the day how long will he who is against me be given power over me
 let my voice come before you and give me an answer o lord my god let your light be shining on me so that the sleep of death may not overtake me
 and he who is against me may not say i have overcome him and those who are troubling me may not be glad when i am moved
 but i have had faith in your mercy my heart will be glad in your salvation
 i will make a song to the lord because he has given me my reward
 &lta song of the going up&gt out of the deep have i sent up my cry to you o lord
 lord let my voice come before you let your ears be awake to the voice of my prayer
 o jah if you took note of every sin who would go free
 but there is forgiveness with you so that you may be feared
 i am waiting for the lord my soul is waiting for him and my hope is in his word
 my soul is watching for the lord more than those who are watching for the morning yes more than the watchers for the morning
 o israel have hope in the lord for with the lord is mercy and full salvation
 and he will make israel free from all his sins
 &lta song of the going up of david&gt lord there is no pride in my heart and my eyes are not lifted up and i have not taken part in great undertakings or in things over hard for me
 see i have made my soul calm and quiet like a child on its mothers breast my soul is like a child on its mothers breast
 o israel have hope in the lord from this time and for ever
 &lta song of the going up&gt lord give thought to david and to all his troubles
 how he made an oath to the lord and gave his word to the great god of jacob saying
