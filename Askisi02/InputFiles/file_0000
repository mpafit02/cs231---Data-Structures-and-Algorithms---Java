 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and sosthenes the brother
 to the church of god which is in corinth to those who have been made holy in christ jesus saints by the selection of god with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our lord jesus christ their lord and ours
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to my god for you at all times because of the grace of god which has been given to you in christ jesus
 so that in him you have wealth in all things in word and in knowledge of every sort
 even as the witness of the christ has been made certain among you
 so that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our lord jesus christ
 who will give you strength to the end to be free from all sin in the day of our lord jesus christ
 god is true through whom you have been given a part with his son jesus christ our lord
 now i make request to you my brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ that you will all say the same thing and that there may be no divisions among you so that you may be in complete agreement in the same mind and in the same opinion
 because it has come to my knowledge through those of the house of chloe that there are divisions among you my brothers
 that is that some of you say i am of paul some say i am of apollos some say i am of cephas and some say i am christs
 is there a division in christ was paul nailed to the cross for you or were you given baptism in the name of paul
 i give praise to god that not one of you had baptism from me but crispus and gaius
 so that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name
 and i gave baptism to the house of stephanas but i am not certain that any others had baptism from me
 for christ sent me not to give baptism but to be a preacher of the good news not with wise words for fear that the cross of christ might be made of no value
 for the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of god
 as it says in the holy writings i will put an end to the wisdom of the wise and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge
 where is the wise where is he who has knowledge of the law where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
 for because by the purpose of god the world with all its wisdom had not the knowledge of god it was gods pleasure by so foolish a thing as preaching to give salvation to those who had faith in him
 seeing that the jews make request for signs and the greeks are looking for knowledge
 but we give the good news of christ on the cross a hard thing to the jews and a foolish thing to the gentiles
 but to those of gods selection jews and greeks christ is the power and the wisdom of god
 because what seems foolish in god is wiser than men and what seems feeble in god is stronger than men
 for you see gods design for you my brothers that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh not the strong not the noble
 but god made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong
 and the low things of the world and the things without honour did god make selection of yes even the things which are not so that he might make as nothing the things which are
 so that no flesh might have glory before god
 but god has given you a place in christ jesus through whom god has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation and made us holy
