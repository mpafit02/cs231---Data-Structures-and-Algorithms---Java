 the sons of gershom shebuel the first
 and the sons of eliezer rehabiah the first and eliezer had no other sons but rehabiah had a great number
 the sons of izhar shelomith the first
 the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth
 the sons of uzziel micah the first and isshiah the second
 the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli eleazar and kish
 and at his death eleazar had no sons but only daughters and their relations the sons of kish took them as wives
 the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three
 these were the sons of levi grouped by families the heads of the families of those who were numbered by name by heads all those of twenty years old and over who did the work of the house of the lord
 for david said the lord the god of israel has given his people rest and he has made his resting place in jerusalem for ever
 and from now there will be no need for the house of the lord and the vessels used in it to be moved about by the levites
 so among the last acts of david was the numbering of the sons of levi from twenty years old and over
 their place was by the side of the sons of aaron in all the work of the house of the lord in the open spaces and in the rooms in the making clean of all the holy things in doing all the work of the house of the lord
 the holy bread was in their care and the crushed grain for the meal offering of unleavened cakes or meal cooked over the fire or in water they had control of all sorts of weights and measures
 they had to take their places every morning to give praise and make melody to the lord and in the same way at evening
 at every offering of burned offerings to the lord on sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts in the number ordered by the law at all times before the lord
 and they had the care of the tent of meeting and the holy place under the direction of the sons of aaron their brothers for the work of the house of the lord
 now the divisions into which the sons of aaron were grouped were these the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
 but nadab and abihu came to their end before their father and had no children so eleazar and ithamar did the work of priests
 and david with zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar made distribution of them into their positions for their work
 and there were more chiefs among the sons of eleazar than among the sons of ithamar and this is how they were grouped of the sons of eleazar there were sixteen all heads of families and of the sons of ithamar heads of families there were eight
 so they were put into groups by the lords decision one with another for there were rulers of the holy place and rulers of the house of god among the sons of eleazar and the sons of ithamar
 and shemaiah the son of nethanel the scribe who was a levite put down their names in writing the king being present with the rulers and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and the levites one family being taken for eleazar and then one for ithamar and so on
 now the first name to come out was that of jehoiarib the second jedaiah
 the third harim the fourth seorim
 the fifth malchijah the sixth mijamin
 the seventh hakkoz the eighth abijah
 the ninth jeshua the tenth shecaniah
 the eleventh eliashib the twelfth jakim
 the thirteenth huppah the fourteenth jeshebeab
