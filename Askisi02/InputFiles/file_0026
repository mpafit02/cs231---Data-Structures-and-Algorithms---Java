 but his wrongdoing was pointed out to him an ass talking with a mans voice put a stop to the error of the prophet
 these are fountains without water and mists before a driving storm for whom the eternal night is kept in store
 for with high sounding false words making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error
 saying that they will be free while they themselves are the servants of destruction because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him
 for if after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again taken in the net and overcome their last condition is worse than their first
 for it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them after having knowledge of it
 they are an example of that true saying the dog has gone back to the food it had put out and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth
 my loved ones this is now my second letter to you and in this as in the first i am attempting to keep your true minds awake
 so that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past and the law of the lord and saviour which was given to you by his apostles
 having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who ruled by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
 saying where is the hope of his coming from the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world
 but in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water by the word of god
 and that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters
 but the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men
 but my loved ones keep in mind this one thing that with the lord one day is the same as a thousand years and a thousand years are no more than one day
 the lord is not slow in keeping his word as he seems to some but he is waiting in mercy for you not desiring the destruction of any but that all may be turned from their evil ways
 but the day of the lord will come like a thief and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat and the world and everything in it will be burned up
 seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end what sort of persons is it right for you to be in all holy behaviour and righteousness
 looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of god when the heavens will come to an end through fire and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat
 but having faith in his word we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth which will be the resting place of righteousness
 for this reason my loved ones as you are looking for these things take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him free from sin and every evil thing
 and be certain that the long waiting of the lord is for salvation even as our brother paul has said in his letters to you from the wisdom which was given to him
 and as he said in all his letters which had to do with these things in which are some hard sayings so that like the rest of the holy writings they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge to the destruction of their souls
 for this reason my loved ones having knowledge of these things before they take place take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled so falling from your true faith
 but be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ may he have glory now and for ever so be it
 that which was from the first which has come to our ears and which we have seen with our eyes looking on it and touching it with our hands about the word of life
  and the life was made clear to us and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the father and was seen by us 
 we give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears so that you may be united with us and we are united with the father and with his son jesus christ
 and we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete
 this is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you that god is light and in him there is nothing dark
