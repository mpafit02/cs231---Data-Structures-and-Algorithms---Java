 then zipporah took a sharp stone and cutting off the skin of her sons private parts and touching his feet with it she said truly you are a husband of blood to me
 so he let him go then she said you are a husband of blood because of the circumcision
 and the lord said to aaron go into the waste land and you will see moses so he went and came across moses at the mountain of god and gave him a kiss
 and moses gave aaron an account of all the words of the lord which he had sent him to say and of all the signs which he had given him orders to do
 then moses and aaron went and got together all the chiefs of the children of israel
 and aaron said to them all the words the lord had said to moses and did the signs before all the people
 and the people had faith in them and hearing that the lord had taken up the cause of the children of israel and had seen their troubles with bent heads they gave him worship
 and the lord said to moses
 on the first day of the first month you are to put up the house of the tent of meeting
 and inside it put the ark of the law hanging the veil before it
 and put the table inside placing all the things on it in order and put in the support for the lights and let its lights be burning
 and put the gold altar for burning perfumes in front of the ark of the law hanging the curtain over the doorway of the house
 and put the altar of burned offerings before the doorway of the house of the tent of meeting
 and let the washing vessel with water in it be put between the tent of meeting and the altar
 and put up the hangings forming the open space all round it with the curtain over its doorway
 and take the holy oil and put it on the house and everything in it and make it and everything in it holy
 and put oil on the altar of burned offering and make it and all its vessels holy this altar is to be most holy
 and put oil on the washing vessel and its base and make them holy
 then let aaron and his sons come to the door of the tent of meeting and after washing them with water
 you are to put on aaron the holy robes and you are to put oil on him and make him holy so that he may be my priest
 and take his sons with him and put coats on them
 and put oil on them as you did on their father so that they may be my priests the putting on of oil will make them priests for ever from generation to generation
 and moses did this as the lord gave him orders so he did
 so on the first day of the first month in the second year the house was put up
 moses put up the house placing its bases in position and lifting up its uprights putting in the rods and planting the pillars in their places
 stretching the outer tent over it and covering it as the lord had given him orders
 and he took the law and put it inside the ark and put the rods at its side and the cover over it
 and he took the ark into the house hanging up the veil before it as the lord had given him orders
 and he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side outside the veil
 and he put the bread on it in order before the lord as the lord had said
