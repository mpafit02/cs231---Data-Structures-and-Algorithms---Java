 do not take away the property of the poor man because he is poor or be cruel to the crushed ones when they come before the judge
 for the lord will give support to their cause and take the life of those who take their goods
 do not be friends with a man who is given to wrath do not go in the company of an angry man
 for fear of learning his ways and making a net ready for your soul
 be not one of those who give their hands in an agreement or of those who make themselves responsible for debts
 if you have nothing with which to make payment he will take away your bed from under you
 let not the old landmark be moved which your fathers have put in place
 have you seen a man who is expert in his business he will take his place before kings his place will not be among low persons
 when you take your seat at the feast with a ruler give thought with care to what is before you
 and put a knife to your throat if you have a strong desire for food
 have no desire for his delicate food for it is the bread of deceit
 take no care to get wealth let there be an end to your desire for money
 are your eyes lifted up to it it is gone for wealth takes to itself wings like an eagle in flight up to heaven
 do not take the food of him who has an evil eye or have any desire for his delicate meat
 for as the thoughts of his heart are so is he take food and drink he says to you but his heart is not with you
 the food which you have taken will come up again and your pleasing words will be wasted
 say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words
 do not let the landmark of the widow be moved and do not go into the fields of those who have no father
 for their saviour is strong and he will take up their cause against you
 give your heart to teaching and your ears to the words of knowledge
 do not keep back training from the child for even if you give him blows with the rod it will not be death to him
 give him blows with the rod and keep his soul safe from the underworld
 my son if your heart becomes wise i even i will be glad in heart
 and my thoughts in me will be full of joy when your lips say right things
 have no envy of sinners in your heart but keep in the fear of the lord all through the day
 for without doubt there is a future and your hope will not be cut off
 give ear my son and be wise guiding your heart in the right way
 do not be among those who give themselves to wine drinking or among those who make themselves full with meat
 for those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed
 give ear to your father whose child you are and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old
