 and separating his forces by night he overcame them putting them to flight and going after them as far as hobah which is on the north side of damascus
 and he got back all the goods and lot his brothers son with his goods and the women and the people
 and when he was coming back after putting to flight chedorlaomer and the other kings he had a meeting with the king of sodom in the valley of shaveh that is the kings valley
 and melchizedek king of salem the priest of the most high god took bread and wine
 and blessing him said may the blessing of the most high god maker of heaven and earth be on abram
 and let the most high god be praised who has given into your hands those who were against you then abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken
 and the king of sodom said to abram give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself
 but abram said to the king of sodom i have taken an oath to the lord the most high god maker of heaven and earth
 that i will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours so that you may not say i have given wealth to abram
 give me nothing but the food which the fighting men who went with me have had but let aner and eshcol and mamre have their part of the goods
 after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying have no fear abram i will keep you safe and great will be your reward
 and abram said what will you give me for i have no child and this eliezer of damascus will have all my wealth after me
 and abram said you have given me no child and a servant in my house will get the heritage
 then said the lord this man will not get the heritage but a son of your body will have your property after you
 and he took him out into the open air and said to him let your eyes be lifted to heaven and see if the stars may be numbered even so will your seed be
 and he had faith in the lord and it was put to his account as righteousness
 and he said to him i am the lord who took you from ur of the chaldees to give you this land for your heritage
 and he said o lord god how may i be certain that it will be mine
 and he said take a young cow of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a sheep of three years old and a dove and a young pigeon
 all these he took cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other but not cutting the birds in two
 and evil birds came down on the bodies but abram sent them away
 now when the sun was going down a deep sleep came on abram and a dark cloud of fear
 and he said to abram truly your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years
 but i will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are and they will come out from among them with great wealth
 as for you you will go to your fathers in peace at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting place
 and in the fourth generation they will come back here for at present the sin of the amorite is not full
 then when the sun went down and it was dark he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies
 in that day the lord made an agreement with abram and said to your seed have i given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates
 the kenite the kenizzite and the kadmonite
 and the hittite and the perizzite and the rephaim
