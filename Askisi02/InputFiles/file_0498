 do not put anyone to death without cause
 do not be false to the married relation
 do not take the property of another
 do not give false witness against your neighbour
 let not your desire be turned to your neighbours house or his wife or his man servant or his woman servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his
 and all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking and when they saw it they kept far off shaking with fear
 and they said to moses to your words we will give ear but let not the voice of god come to our ears for fear death may come on us
 and moses said to the people have no fear for god has come to put you to the test so that fearing him you may be kept from sin
 and the people kept their places far off but moses went near to the dark cloud where god was
 and the lord said to moses say to the children of israel you yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven
 gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves
 make for me an altar of earth offering on it your burned offerings and your peace offerings your sheep and your oxen in every place where i have put the memory of my name i will come to you and give you my blessing
 and if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean
 and do not go up by steps to my altar for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered
 now these are the laws which you are to put before them
 if you get a hebrew servant for money he is to be your servant for six years and in the seventh year you are to let him go free without payment
 if he comes to you by himself let him go away by himself if he is married let his wife go away with him
 if his master gives him a wife and he gets sons or daughters by her the wife and her children will be the property of the master and the servant is to go away by himself
 but if the servant says clearly my master and my wife and children are dear to me i have no desire to be free
 then his master is to take him to the gods of the house and at the door or at its framework he is to make a hole in his ear with a sharp pointed instrument and he will be his servant for ever
 and if a man gives his daughter for a price to be a servant she is not to go away free as the men servants do
 if she is not pleasing to her master who has taken her for himself let a payment be made for her so that she may go free her master has no power to get a price for her and send her to a strange land because he has been false to her
 and if he gives her to his son he is to do everything for her as if she was his daughter
 and if he takes another woman her food and clothing and her married rights are not to be less
 and if he does not do these three things for her she has the right to go free without payment
 he who gives a man a death blow is himself to be put to death
 but if he had no evil purpose against him and god gave him into his hand i will give you a place to which he may go in flight
 but if a man makes an attack on his neighbour on purpose to put him to death by deceit you are to take him from my altar and put him to death
 any man who gives a blow to his father or his mother is certainly to be put to death
 any man who gets another into his power in order to get a price for him is to be put to death if you take him in the act
