 i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob and moses shaking with fear kept his eyes from looking at it
 and the lord said take off the shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
 truly i have seen the sorrows of my people in egypt and their cries have come to my ears and i have come down to make them free and now come i will send you to egypt
 this moses whom they would not have saying who made you a ruler and a judge him god sent to be a ruler and a saviour by the hand of the angel whom he saw in the thorn tree
 this man took them out having done wonders and signs in egypt and in the red sea and in the waste land for forty years
 this is the same moses who said to the children of israel god will give you a prophet from among your brothers like me
 this is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in sinai and with our fathers and to him were given the living words of god so that he might give them to you
 by whom our fathers would not be controlled but they put him on one side turning back in their hearts to egypt
 and saying to aaron make us gods to go before us as for this moses who took us out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has become of him
 and they made the image of a young ox in those days and made an offering to it and had joy in the work of their hands
 but god was turned from them and let them give worship to the stars of heaven as it says in the book of the prophets did you make offerings to me of sheep and oxen for forty years in the waste land o house of israel
 and you took up the tent of moloch and the star of the god rephan images which you made to give worship to them and i will take you away farther than babylon
 our fathers had the tent of witness in the waste land as god gave orders to moses to make it after the design which he had seen
 which our fathers in their turn took with them when with joshua they came into the heritage of the nations whom god was driving out before the face of our fathers till the time of david
 who was pleasing to god and he had a desire to make a holy tent for the god of jacob
 but solomon was the builder of his house
 but still the most high has not his resting place in houses made with hands as the prophet says
 heaven is the seat of my power and earth is a resting place for my feet what sort of house will you make for me says the lord or what is my place of rest
 did not my hand make all these things
 you whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me you are ever working against the holy spirit as your fathers did so do you
 which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the upright one whom you have now given up and put to death
 you to whom the law was given as it was ordered by angels and who have not kept it
 hearing these things they were cut to the heart and moved with wrath against him
 but he was full of the holy spirit and looking up to heaven he saw the glory of god and jesus at the right hand of god
 and he said now i see heaven open and the son of man at the right hand of god
 but with loud cries and stopping their ears they made an attack on him all together
 driving him out of the town and stoning him and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named saul
 and stephen while he was being stoned made prayer to god saying lord jesus take my spirit
 and going down on his knees he said in a loud voice lord do not make them responsible for this sin and when he had said this he went to his rest
 and saul gave approval to his death now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in jerusalem and all but the apostles went away into all parts of judaea and samaria
