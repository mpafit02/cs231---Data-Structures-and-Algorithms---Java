 the poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
 then a great number of the jews had news that he was there and they came not only because of jesus but so that they might see lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life
 now there was talk among the chief priests of putting lazarus to death
 for because of him a great number of the jews went away and had belief in jesus
 the day after a great number of people who were there for the feast when they had the news that jesus was coming to jerusalem
 took branches of palm trees and went out to him crying a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord the king of israel 
 and jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it as the writings say
 have no fear daughter of zion see your king is coming seated on a young ass
  these things were not clear to his disciples at first but when jesus had been lifted up into his glory then it came to their minds that these things in the writings were about him and that they had been done to him 
 now the people who were with him when his voice came to lazarus in the place of the dead and gave him life again had been talking about it
 and that was the reason the people went out to him because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign
 then the pharisees said one to another you see you are unable to do anything the world has gone after him
 now there were some greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast
 they came to philip who was of beth saida in galilee and made a request saying sir we have a desire to see jesus
 philip went and gave word of it to andrew and andrew went with philip to jesus
 and jesus said to them in answer the hour of the glory of the son of man has come
 truly i say to you if a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end it is still a seed and no more but through its death it gives much fruit
 he who is in love with life will have it taken from him and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever
 if any man is my servant let him come after me and where i am there will my servant be if any man becomes my servant my father will give him honour
 now is my soul troubled and what am i to say father keep me from this hour no for this purpose have i come to this hour
 father give glory to your name then there came a voice out of heaven saying i have given it glory and i will give it glory again
 hearing the sound a number of people who were there said that it was thunder others said an angel was talking to him
 jesus said in answer this voice came not for me but for you
 now is this world to be judged now will the ruler of this world be sent out
 and i if i am lifted up from the earth will make all men come to me
  this he said pointing to the sort of death he would have 
 then the people in answer said to him the law says that the christ will have life without end how say you then that it is necessary for the son of man to be lifted up who is this son of man
 jesus said to them for a little time longer the light will be among you while you have the light go on walking in it so that the dark may not overtake you one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going
 in so far as you have the light put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light with these words jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them
 but though he had done such a number of signs before them they still had no belief in him
