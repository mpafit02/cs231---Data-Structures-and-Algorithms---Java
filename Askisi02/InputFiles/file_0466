 who took the fat of their offerings and the wine of their drink offering let them now come to your help let them be your salvation
 see now i myself am he there is no other god but me giver of death and life wounding and making well and no one has power to make you free from my hand
 for lifting up my hand to heaven i say by my unending life
 if i make sharp my shining sword and my hand is outstretched for judging i will give punishment to those who are against me and their right reward to my haters
 i will make my arrows red with blood my sword will be feasting on flesh with the blood of the dead and the prisoners of the long haired heads of my haters
 be glad o you his people over the nations for he will take payment for the blood of his servants and will give punishment to his haters and take away the sin of his land for his people
 so moses said all the words of this song in the hearing of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
 and after saying all this to the people
 moses said to them let the words which i have said to you today go deep into your hearts and give orders to your children to do every word of this law
 and this is no small thing for you but it is your life and through this you may make your days long in the land which you are going over jordan to take for your heritage
 that same day the lord said to moses
 go up into this mountain of abarim to mount nebo in the land of moab opposite jericho there you may see the land of canaan which i am giving to the children of israel for their heritage
 and let death come to you on the mountain where you are going and be put to rest with your people as death came to aaron your brother on mount hor where he was put to rest with his people
 because of your sin against me before the children of israel at the waters of meribath kadesh in the waste land of zin because you did not keep my name holy among the children of israel
 so you will see the land before you but you will not go into the land which i am giving to the children of israel
 now this is the blessing which moses the man of god gave to the children of israel before his death
 he said the lord came from sinai dawning on them from seir shining out from mount paran coming from meribath kadesh from his right hand went flames of fire his wrath made waste the peoples
 all his holy ones are at his hand they go at his feet they are lifted up on his wings
 moses gave us a law a heritage for the people of jacob
 and there was a king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel came together
 let life not death be reubens let not the number of his men be small
 and this is the blessing of judah he said give ear o lord to the voice of judah and make him one with his people let your hands take up his cause and be his help against his attackers
 and of levi he said give your thummim to levi and let the urim be with your loved one whom you put to the test at massah with whom you were angry at the waters of meribah
 who said of his father who is he and of his mother i have not seen her he kept himself separate from his brothers and had no knowledge of his children for they have given ear to your word and kept your agreement
 they will be the teachers of your decisions to jacob and of your law to israel the burning of perfumes before you will be their right and the ordering of burned offerings on your altar
 let your blessing o lord be on his substance may the work of his hands be pleasing to you may those who take up arms against him and all who have hate for him be wounded through the heart never to be lifted up again
 and of benjamin he said benjamin is the loved one of the lord he will be kept safe at all times he will be covered by the most high resting between his arms
 and of joseph he said let the blessing of the lord be on his land for the good things of heaven on high and the deep waters flowing under the earth
 and the good things of the fruits of the sun and the good things of the growth of the moons
 and the chief things of the oldest mountains and the good things of the eternal hills
