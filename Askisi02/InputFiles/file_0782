 and the children of israel sent phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh to the land of gilead
 and with him they sent ten chiefs one for every tribe of the children of israel every one of them the head of his house among the families of israel
 and they came to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh to the land of gilead and said to them
 this is what all the meeting of the people of the lord has said what is this wrong which you have done against the god of israel turning back this day from the lord and building an altar for yourselves and being false to the lord
 was not the sin of baal peor great enough from which we are not clear even to this day though punishment came on the people of the lord
 that now you are turned back from the lord and because you are false to him today tomorrow his wrath will be let loose on all the people of israel
 but if the land you now have is unclean come over into the lords land where his house is and take up your heritage among us but do not be false to the lord and to us by building yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of the lord our god
 did not achan the son of zerah do wrong about the cursed thing causing wrath to come on all the people of israel and not on him only came the punishment of death
 then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of israel
 god even god the lord god even god the lord he sees and israel will see  if it is in pride or in sin against the lord
 that we have made ourselves an altar being false to the lord keep us not safe from death this day and if for the purpose of offering burned offerings on it and meal offerings or peace offerings let the lord himself send punishment for it
 and if we have not in fact done this designedly and with purpose having in our minds the fear that in time to come your children might say to our children what have you to do with the lord the god of israel
 for the lord has made jordan a line of division between us and you the children of reuben and the children of gad you have no part in the lord so your children will make our children give up fearing the lord
 so we said let us now make an altar for ourselves not for burned offerings or for the offerings of beasts
 but to be a witness between us and you and between the future generations that we have the right of worshipping the lord with our burned offerings and our offerings of beasts and our peace offerings so that your children will not be able to say to our children in time to come you have no part in the lord
 for we said to ourselves if they say this to us or to future generations then we will say see this copy of the lords altar which our fathers made not for burned offerings or offerings of beasts but for a witness between us and you
 never let it be said that we were false to the lord turning back this day from him and building an altar for burned offerings and meal offerings and offerings of beasts in addition to the altar of the lord our god which is before his house
 then phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the meeting and the heads of the families of israel who were with him hearing what the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh said were pleased
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh now we are certain that the lord is among us because you have not done this wrong against the lord and you have kept us from falling into the hands of the lord
 then phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the chiefs went back from the land of gilead from the children of reuben and the children of gad and came to the children of israel in canaan and gave them the news
 and the children of israel were pleased about this and they gave praise to god and had no more thought of going to war against the children of reuben and the children of gad for the destruction of their land
 and the children of reuben and the children of gad gave to that altar the name of ed for they said it is a witness between us that the lord is god
 now after a long time when the lord had given israel rest from wars on every side and joshua was old and full of years
 joshua sent for all israel for their responsible men and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and said to them i am old and full of years
 you have seen everything the lord your god has done to all these nations because of you for it is the lord your god who has been fighting for you
 now i have given to you as the heritage of your tribes all these nations which are still in the land together with those cut off by me from jordan as far as the great sea on the west
 the lord your god will send them away by force driving them out before you and you are to take their land for your heritage as the lord your god said to you
 so be very strong to keep and do whatever is recorded in the book of the law of moses not turning away from it to the right or to the left
 have nothing to do with these nations who still are living among you let not their gods be named by you or used in your oaths do not be their servants or give them worship
 but be true to the lord your god as you have been till this day
