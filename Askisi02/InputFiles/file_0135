 so that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching
 in the days of herod king of judaea there was a certain priest by name zacharias of the order of abijah and he had a wife of the family of aaron and her name was elisabeth
 they were upright in the eyes of god keeping all the rules and orders of god and doing no wrong
 and they were without children because elisabeth had never given birth and they were at that time very old
 now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before god
 and as was the way of the priests he had to go into the temple to see to the burning of perfumes
 and all the people were offering prayers outside at the time of the burning of perfumes
 and he saw an angel of the lord in his place on the right side of the altar
 and zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear came on him
 but the angel said have no fear zacharias for your prayer has come to the ears of god and your wife elisabeth will have a son and his name will be john
 and you will be glad and have great delight and numbers of people will have joy at his birth
 for he will be great in the eyes of the lord he will not take wine or strong drink and he will be full of the spirit of god from his birth
 and through him great numbers of the children of israel will be turned to the lord their god
 and he will go before his face in the spirit and power of elijah turning the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the lord
 and zacharias said to the angel how may i be certain of this for i am an old man and my wife is far on in years
 and the angel answering said i am gabriel whose place is before god i have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news
 now see you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about because you had not faith in my words which will have effect at the right time
 and the people were waiting for zacharias and were surprised because he was in the temple for such a long time
 and when he came out he was not able to say anything and they saw that he had seen a vision in the temple and he was making signs to them without words
 and when the days of his work in the temple were ended he went back to his house
 after that time elisabeth being certain that she was to become a mother kept herself from mens eyes for five months saying
 the lord has done this to me for his eyes were on me to take away my shame in the eyes of men
 now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god to a town in galilee named nazareth
 to a virgin who was to be married to a man named joseph of the family of david and the name of the virgin was mary
 and the angel came in to her and said peace be with you to whom special grace has been given the lord is with you
 but she was greatly troubled at his words and said to herself what may be the purpose of these words
 and the angel said to her have no fear mary for you have gods approval
 and see you will give birth to a son and his name will be jesus
 he will be great and will be named the son of the most high and the lord god will give him the kingdom of david his father
 he will have rule over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there will be no end
