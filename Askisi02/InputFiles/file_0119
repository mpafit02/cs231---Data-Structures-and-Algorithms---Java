 but when they came to jesus they saw that he was dead by this time and so his legs were not broken
 but one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear and straight away there came out blood and water
 and he who saw it has given witness  and his witness is true he is certain that what he says is true  so that you may have belief
 these things came about so that the writings might be true no bone of his body will be broken
 and again another verse says they will see him who was wounded by their spears
 after these things joseph of arimathaea who was a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews made a request to pilate to let him take away the body of jesus and pilate said he might do so so he went and took away his body
 and nicodemus came  he who had first come to jesus by night  with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed about a hundred pounds
 then they took the body of jesus folding linen about it with the spices as is the way of the jews when they put the dead to rest
 now there was a garden near the cross and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put
 so they put jesus there because it was the jews day of getting ready for the passover and the place was near
 on the third day two people were going to be married at cana in galilee the mother of jesus was there
 and jesus with his disciples came as guests
 when they had not enough wine the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
 jesus said to her woman this is not your business my time is still to come
 his mother said to the servants whatever he says to you do it
 now six pots of stone every one taking two or three firkins of water were placed there for the purpose of washing as is the way of the jews
 jesus said to the servants make the pots full of water and they made them full to the top
 then he said to them now take some and give it to the master of the feast so they took it to him
 after tasting the water which had now become wine the master of the feast  having no idea where it came from though it was clear to the servants who took the water out  sent for the newly married man
 and said to him every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good but you have kept the good wine till now
 this the first of his signs jesus did at cana in galilee and let his glory be seen openly and his disciples put their faith in him
 after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they were there not more than two or three days
 the time of the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
 and there in the temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves and he saw the changers of money in their seats
 and he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the temple with the sheep and the oxen sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables
 and to those who were trading in doves he said take these things away do not make my fathers house a market
 and it came to the minds of the disciples that the writings say i am on fire with passion for your house
 then the jews put this question to him what sign of authority have you to give us seeing that you do these things
 and jesus said to them send destruction on this temple and i will put it up again in three days
 the jews said the building of this temple took forty six years and you will put it up in three days
