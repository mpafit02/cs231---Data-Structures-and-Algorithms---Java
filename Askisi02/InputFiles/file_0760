 he takes the wise in their secret designs and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly
 in the daytime it becomes dark for them and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night
 but he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father and the poor from the power of the strong
 so the poor man has hope and the mouth of the evil doer is stopped
 truly that man is happy who has training from the hand of god so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the ruler of all
 for after his punishment he gives comfort and after wounding his hands make you well
 he will keep you safe from six troubles and in seven no evil will come near you
 when there is need of food he will keep you from death and in war from the power of the sword
 he will keep you safe from the evil tongue and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes
 you will make sport of destruction and need and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth
 for you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you
 and you will be certain that your tent is at peace and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone
 you will be certain that your seed will be great and your offspring like the plants of the earth
 you will come to your last resting place in full strength as the grain is taken up to the crushing floor in its time
 see we have made search with care and it is so it has come to our ears see that you take note of it for yourself
 and job made answer and said
 if only my passion might be measured and put into the scales against my trouble 
 for then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas because of this my words have been uncontrolled
 for the arrows of the ruler of all are present with me and their poison goes deep into my spirit his army of fears is put in order against me
 does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass or does the ox make sounds over his food
 will a man take food which has no taste without salt or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain
 my soul has no desire for such things they are as disease in my food
 if only i might have an answer to my prayer and god would give me my desire 
 if only he would be pleased to put an end to me and would let loose his hand so that i might be cut off 
 so i would still have comfort and i would have joy in the pains of death for i have not been false to the words of the holy one
 have i strength to go on waiting or have i any end to be looking forward to
 is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh brass
 i have no help in myself and wisdom is completely gone from me
 he whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the ruler of all
 my friends have been false like a stream like streams in the valleys which come to an end
