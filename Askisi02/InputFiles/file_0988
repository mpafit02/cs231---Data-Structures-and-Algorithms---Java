 my downfall is ever before me and i am covered with the shame of my face
 because of the voice of him who says sharp and bitter words because of the hater and him who is the instrument of punishment
 all this has come on us but still we have kept you in our memory and we have not been false to your word
 our hearts have not gone back and our steps have not been turned out of your way
 though you have let us be crushed in the place of jackals though we are covered with darkest shade
 if the name of our god has gone out of our minds or if our hands have been stretched out to a strange god
 will not god make search for it for he sees the secrets of the heart
 truly because of you we are put to death every day we are numbered like sheep for destruction
 why are you sleeping o lord awake  and come to our help do not give us up for ever
 why is your face covered and why do you give no thought to our trouble and our cruel fate
 for our souls are crushed down to the dust our bodies are stretched out on the earth
 up  and come to our help and give us salvation because of your mercy
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim of the sons of korah maschil a song of loves&gt my heart is flowing over with good things my words are of that which i have made for a king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
