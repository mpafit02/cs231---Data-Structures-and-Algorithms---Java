 if a man was desiring to go to law with him he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions
 he is wise in heart and great in strength who ever made his face hard against him and any good came of it
 it is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge overturning them in his wrath
 who is moving the earth out of its place so that its pillars are shaking
 who gives orders to the sun and it does not give its light and who keeps the stars from shining
 by whose hand the heavens were stretched out and who is walking on the waves of the sea
 who made the bear and orion and the pleiades and the store houses of the south
 who does great things not to be searched out yes wonders without number
 see he goes past me and i see him not he goes on before but i have no knowledge of him
 if he puts out his hand to take by whom may it be turned back who may say to him what are you doing
 gods wrath may not be turned back the helpers of rahab were bent down under him
 how much less may i give an answer to him using the right words in argument with him
 even if my cause was good i would not be able to give an answer i would make request for grace from him who was against me
 if i had sent for him to be present and he had come i would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice
 for i would be crushed by his storm my wounds would be increased without cause
 he would not let me take my breath but i would be full of bitter grief
 if it is a question of strength he says here i am  and if it is a question of a cause at law he says who will give me a fixed day
 though i was in the right he would say that i was in the wrong i have done no evil but he says that i am a sinner
 i have done no wrong i give no thought to what becomes of me i have no desire for life
 it is all the same to me so i say he puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together
 if death comes suddenly through disease he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong
 the land is given into the power of the evil doer the faces of its judges are covered if not by him then who has done it
 my days go quicker than a post runner they go in flight they see no good
 they go rushing on like reed boats like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food
 if i say i will put my grief out of mind i will let my face be sad no longer and i will be bright
 i go in fear of all my pains i am certain that i will not be free from sin in your eyes
 you will not let me be clear of sin  why then do i take trouble for nothing
 if i am washed with snow water and make my hands clean with soap
 then you will have me pushed into the dust so that i will seem disgusting to my very clothing
 for he is not a man as i am that i might give him an answer that we might come together before a judge
