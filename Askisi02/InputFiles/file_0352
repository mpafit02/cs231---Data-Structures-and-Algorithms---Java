 now rehoboam kept in jerusalem building walled towns in judah
 he was the builder of beth lehem and etam and tekoa
 and beth zur and soco and adullam
 and gath and mareshah and ziph
 and adoraim and lachish and azekah
 and zorah and aijalon and hebron walled towns in judah and benjamin
 and he made the walled towns strong and he put captains in them and stores of food oil and wine
 and in every town he put stores of body covers and spears and made them very strong and judah and benjamin were his
 and the priests and levites who were in all israel came together to him from every part of their country
 for the levites gave up their living places and their property and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had sent them away not letting them be priests to the lord
 and he himself made priests for the high places and for the images of he goats and oxen which he had made
 and after them from all the tribes of israel all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the lord the god of israel came to jerusalem to make offerings to the lord the god of their fathers
 so they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong for three years and for three years they went in the ways of david and solomon
 and rehoboam took as his wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david and of abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse
 and she had sons by him jeush shemariah and zaham
 and after her he took maacah the daughter of absalom and she had abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith by him
 maacah the daughter of absalom was dearer to rehoboam than all his wives and his servant wives  for he had eighteen wives and sixty servant wives and was the father of twenty eight sons and sixty daughters 
 rehoboam made abijah the son of maacah chief and ruler among his brothers for it was his purpose to make him king
 and in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of judah and benjamin and he gave them a great store of food and took wives for them
 now when rehoboams position as king had been made certain and he was strong he gave up the law of the lord and all israel with him
 now in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because of their sin against the lord
 with twelve hundred war carriages and sixty thousand horsemen and the people who came with him out of egypt were more than might be numbered lubim and sukkiim and ethiopians
 and he took the walled towns of judah and came as far as jerusalem
 now shemaiah the prophet came to rehoboam and the chiefs of judah who had come together in jerusalem because of shishak and said to them the lord has said because you have given me up i have given you up into the hands of shishak
 then the chiefs of israel and the king made themselves low and said the lord is upright
 and the lord seeing that they had made themselves low said to shemaiah they have made themselves low i will not send destruction on them but in a short time i will give them salvation and will not let loose my wrath on jerusalem by the hand of shishak
 but still they will become his servants so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands
 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the lord and the kings house he took everything away and with the rest the gold body covers which solomon had made
 and in their place king rehoboam had other body covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the kings house
 and whenever the king went into the house of the lord the armed men went with him taking the body covers and then took them back to their room
