 will he make an agreement with you so that you may take him as a servant for ever
 will you make sport with him as with a bird or put him in chains for your young women
 will the fishermen make profit out of him will they have him cut up for the traders
 will you put sharp pointed irons into his skin or fish spears into his head
 only put your hand on him and see what a fight you will have you will not do it again 
 truly the hope of his attacker is false he is overcome even on seeing him 
 he is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him who then is able to keep his place before me
 who ever went against me and got the better of me there is no one under heaven 
 i will not keep quiet about the parts of his body or about his power and the strength of his frame
 who has ever taken off his outer skin who may come inside his inner coat of iron
 who has made open the doors of his face fear is round about his teeth
 his back is made of lines of plates joined tight together one against the other like a stamp
 one is so near to the other that no air may come between them
 they take a grip of one another they are joined together so that they may not be parted
 his sneezings give out flames and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn
 out of his mouth go burning lights and flames of fire are jumping up
 smoke comes out of his nose like a pot boiling on the fire
 his breath puts fire to coals and a flame goes out of his mouth
 strength is in his neck and fear goes dancing before him
 the plates of his flesh are joined together fixed and not to be moved
 his heart is as strong as a stone hard as the lower crushing stone
 when he gets ready for the fight the strong are overcome with fear
 the sword may come near him but is not able to go through him the spear or the arrow or the sharp pointed iron
 iron is to him as dry grass and brass as soft wood
 the arrow is not able to put him to flight stones are no more to him than dry stems
 a thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear
 under him are sharp edges of broken pots as if he was pulling a grain crushing instrument over the wet earth
 the deep is boiling like a pot of spices and the sea like a perfume vessel
 after him his way is shining so that the deep seems white
 on earth there is not another like him who is made without fear
