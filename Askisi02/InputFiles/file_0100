 for protesting against them he says see the days are coming when i will make a new agreement with the house of israel and with the house of judah
 not like the agreement which i made with their fathers when i took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of egypt for they did not keep the agreement with me and i gave them up says the lord
 for this is the agreement which i will make with the people of israel after those days i will put my laws into their minds writing them in their hearts and i will be their god and they will be my people
 and there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother or his neighbour saying this is the knowledge of the lord for they will all have knowledge of me great and small
 and i will have mercy on their evil doing and i will not keep their sins in mind
 when he says a new agreement he has made the first agreement old but anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer
 now the first agreement had its rules of worship and a holy order
 for the first tent was made ready having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread and this is named the holy place
 and inside the second veil was the place which is named the holy of holies
 having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes and the ark of the agreement which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna and aarons rod which put out buds and the stones with the writing of the agreement
 and over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy seat about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail
 now while these things were in existence the priests went into the first tent at all times for prayer and the making of offerings
 but only the high priest went into the second once a year not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people
 the holy spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open while the first tent was still in being
 and this is an image of the present time when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean
 because they are only rules of the flesh of meats and drinks and washings which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right
 but now christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future through this greater and better tent not made with hands that is to say not of this world
 and has gone once and for ever into the holy place having got eternal salvation not through the blood of goats and young oxen but through his blood
 for if the blood of goats and oxen and the dust from the burning of a young cow being put on the unclean make the flesh clean
 how much more will the blood of christ who being without sin made an offering of himself to god through the holy spirit make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living god
 and for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death the word of god might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage
 because where there is a testament there has to be the death of the man who made it
 for a testament has effect after death for what power has it while the man who made it is living
 so that even the first agreement was not made without blood
 for when moses had given all the rules of the law to the people he took the blood of goats and young oxen with water and red wool and hyssop and put it on the book itself and on all the people
 saying this blood is the sign of the agreement which god has made with you
 and the blood was put on the tent and all the holy vessels in the same way
 and by the law almost all things are made clean with blood and without blood there is no forgiveness
 for this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these
 for christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by mens hands as the copy of the true one but he went into heaven itself and now takes his place before the face of god for us
