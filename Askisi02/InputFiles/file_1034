 these are the things which you are to do let every man say what is true to his neighbour and let your judging give peace in your towns
 let no one have any evil thought in his heart against his neighbour and have no love for false oaths for all these things are hated by me says the lord
 and the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said the times of going without food in the fourth month and in the fifth and the seventh and the tenth months will be for the people of judah times of joy and happy meetings so be lovers of good faith and of peace
 this is what the lord of armies has said it will again come about that when peoples and those living in great towns come
 and the people of one town go to another and say let us certainly go with a request for grace from the lord and to give worship to the lord of armies then i will go with you
 and great peoples and strong nations will come to give worship to the lord of armies in jerusalem and to make requests for grace from the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said in those days ten men from all the languages of the nations will put out their hands and take a grip of the skirt of him who is a jew saying we will go with you for it has come to our ears that god is with you
 a word of the lord the lord has come to the land of hadrach and damascus is his resting place for the towns of aram are the lords
 as well as hamath which is by its limit and tyre and zidon because they are very wise
 and tyre made for herself a strong place and got together silver like dust and the best gold like the earth of the streets
 see the lord will take away her heritage overturning her power in the sea and she will be burned up with fire
 ashkelon will see it with fear and gaza bent with pain and ekron for her hope will be shamed and the king will be cut off from gaza and ashkelon will be unpeopled
 and a mixed people will be living in ashdod and i will have the pride of the philistines cut off
 and i will take away his blood from his mouth and his disgusting things from between his teeth and some of his people will be kept for our god and he will be as a family in judah and ekron as one living in jerusalem
 and i will put my forces in position round my house so that there may be no coming and going and no cruel master will again go through them for now i have seen his trouble
 be full of joy o daughter of zion give a glad cry o daughter of jerusalem see your king comes to you he is upright and has overcome gentle and seated on an ass on a young ass
 and he will have the war carriage cut off from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will say words of peace to the nations and his rule will be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth
 and as for you because of the blood of your agreement i have sent out your prisoners from the deep hole in which there is no water
 and they will come back to you o daughter of zion as prisoners of hope today i say to you that i will give you back twice as much
 for i have made judah a bow bent for my use i have made ephraim the arrows of the bow i will make your sons o zion take up arms against your sons o greece and will make you like the sword of a man of war
 and the lord will be seen over them and his arrow will go out like the thunder flame and the lord god sounding the war horn will go in the storm winds of the south
 the lord of armies will be a cover for them and they will overcome crushing under foot the armed men they will take their blood for drink like wine they will be full like the sides of the altar
 and the lord their god will be their saviour in that day giving them food like the flock of his people for they will be like the jewels of a crown shining over his land
 for how good it is and how beautiful  grain will make the young men strong and new wine the virgins
 the word of the lord which came to zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hezekiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah
 i will take away everything from the face of the earth says the lord
 i will take away man and beast i will take away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea causing the downfall of the evil doers and cutting man off from the face of the earth says the lord
 and my hand will be stretched out on judah and on all the people of jerusalem cutting off the name of the baal from this place and the name of the false priests
 and the worshippers of the army of heaven on the house tops and the lords worshippers who take oaths by milcom
