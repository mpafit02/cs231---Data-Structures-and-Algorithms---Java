 house and wealth are a heritage from fathers but a wife with good sense is from the lord
 hate of work sends deep sleep on a man and he who has no industry will go without food
 he who keeps the law keeps his soul but death will be the fate of him who takes no note of the word
 he who has pity on the poor gives to the lord and the lord will give him his reward
 give your son training while there is hope let not your heart be purposing his death
 a man of great wrath will have to take his punishment for if you get him out of trouble you will have to do it again
 let your ear be open to suggestion and take teaching so that at the end you may be wise
 a mans heart may be full of designs but the purpose of the lord is unchanging
 the ornament of a man is his mercy and a poor man is better than one who is false
 the fear of the lord gives life and he who has it will have need of nothing no evil will come his way
 the hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin and will not even take it to his mouth again
 when blows overtake the man of pride the simple will get sense say sharp words to the wise and knowledge will be made clear to him
 he who is violent to his father driving away his mother is a son causing shame and a bad name
 a son who no longer gives attention to teaching is turned away from the words of knowledge
 a good for nothing witness makes sport of the judges decision and the mouth of evil doers sends out evil like a stream
 rods are being made ready for the man of pride and blows for the back of the foolish
 my son if you will take my words to your heart storing up my laws in your mind
 so that your ear gives attention to wisdom and your heart is turned to knowledge
 truly if you are crying out for good sense and your request is for knowledge
 if you are looking for her as for silver and searching for her as for stored up wealth
 then the fear of the lord will be clear to you and knowledge of god will be yours
 for the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth come knowledge and reason
 he has salvation stored up for the upright he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil
 he keeps watch on the ways which are right and takes care of those who have the fear of him
 then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting and upright behaviour even of every good way
 for wisdom will come into your heart and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul
 wise purposes will be watching over you and knowledge will keep you
 giving you salvation from the evil man from those whose words are false
 who give up the way of righteousness to go by dark roads
 who take pleasure in wrongdoing and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner
