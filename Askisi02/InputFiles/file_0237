 and on her brow was a name secret babylon the great the mother of the evil women and of the unclean things of the earth
 and i saw the woman overcome as with the wine of the blood of the saints and the blood of those put to death because of jesus and when i saw her i was overcome with a great wonder
 and the angel said to me why were you surprised i will make clear to you the secret of the woman and of the beast on which she is seated which has the seven heads and the ten horns
 the beast which you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the great deep and to go into destruction and those who are on the earth whose names have not been put in the book of life from the first will be full of wonder when they see the beast that he was and is not and still will be
 here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated
 and they are seven kings the five have come to an end the one is the other has not come and when he comes he will have to go on for a little time
 and the beast which was and is not is himself the eighth and is of the seven and he goes into destruction
 and the ten horns which you saw are ten kings which still have been given no kingdom but they are given authority as kings with the beast for one hour
 these have one mind and they give their power and authority to the beast
 these will make war against the lamb and the lamb will overcome them because he is the lord of lords and king of kings and those who are with him are named marked out and true
 and he said to me the waters which you saw where the evil woman is seated are peoples and armies and nations and languages
 and the ten horns which you saw and the beast these will be turned against the evil woman and will make her waste and uncovered and will take her flesh for food and will have her burned with fire
 because god has put it in their hearts to do his purpose and to be of one mind giving their kingdom to the beast till the words of god have effect and are complete
 and the woman whom you saw is the great town which is ruling over the kings of the earth
 after these things i saw another angel coming down out of heaven having great authority and the earth was bright with his glory
 and he gave a loud cry saying babylon the great has come down from her high place she has come to destruction and has become a place of evil spirits and of every unclean spirit and a hole for every unclean and hated bird
 for through the wine of the wrath of her evil desires all the nations have come to destruction and the kings of the earth made themselves unclean with her and the traders of the earth had their wealth increased by the power of her evil ways
 and another voice from heaven came to my ears saying come out of her my people so that you may have no part in her sins and in her punishments
 for her sins have gone up even to heaven and god has taken note of her evil doing
 give to her as she gave even an increased reward for her works in the cup which was mixed by her let there be mixed as much again for herself
 as she gave glory to herself and became more evil in her ways in the same measure give her pain and weeping for she says in her heart i am seated here a queen and am no widow and will in no way see sorrow
 for this reason in one day will her troubles come death and sorrow and need of food and she will be completely burned with fire for strong is the lord god who is her judge
 and the kings of the earth who made themselves unclean with her and in her company gave themselves up to evil will be weeping and crying over her when they see the smoke of her burning
 watching from far away for fear of her punishment saying sorrow sorrow for babylon the great town the strong town  for in one hour you have been judged
 and the traders of the earth are weeping and crying over her because no man has any more desire for their goods
 gold and silver and stones of great price and jewels and delicate linen and robes of purple and silk and red and perfumed wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel made of fair wood and of brass and iron and stone
 and sweet smelling plants and perfumes and wine and oil and well crushed grain and cattle and sheep and horses and carriages and servants and souls of men
 and the fruit of your souls desire has gone from you and all things delicate and shining have come to an end and will never again be seen
 the traders in these things by which their wealth was increased will be watching far off for fear of her punishment weeping and crying
 saying sorrow sorrow for the great town she who was clothed in delicate linen and purple and red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels
