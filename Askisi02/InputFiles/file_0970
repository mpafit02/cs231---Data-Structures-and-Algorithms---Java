 let israel have joy in his maker let the children of zion be glad in their king
 let them give praise to his name in the dance let them make melody to him with instruments of brass and corded instruments of music
 for the lord has pleasure in his people he gives the poor in spirit a crown of salvation
 let the saints have joy and glory let them give cries of joy on their beds
 let the high praises of god be in their mouths and a two edged sword in their hands
 to give the nations the reward of their sins and the peoples their punishment
 to put their kings in chains and their rulers in bands of iron
 to give them the punishment which is in the holy writings this honour is given to all his saints praise be to the lord
 &lta psalm of david&gt lord who may have a resting place in your tent a living place on your holy hill
 he who goes on his way uprightly doing righteousness and saying what is true in his heart
 whose tongue is not false who does no evil to his friend and does not take away the good name of his neighbour
 who gives honour to those who have the fear of the lord turning away from him who has not the lords approval he who takes an oath against himself and makes no change
 he who does not put out his money at interest or for payment give false decisions against men who have done no wrong he who does these things will never be moved
 let the lord be praised give praise to god in his holy place give him praise in the heaven of his power
 give him praise for his acts of power give him praise in the measure of his great strength
 give him praise with the sound of the horn give him praise with corded instruments of music
 give him praise with instruments of brass and in the dance give him praise with horns and corded instruments
 give him praise with the loud brass give him praise with the high sounding brass
 let everything which has breath give praise to the lord let the lord be praised
 &ltmichtam of david&gt keep me safe o god for in you i have put my faith
 o my soul you have said to the lord you are my lord i have no good but you
 as for the saints who are in the earth they are the noble in whom is all my delight
 their sorrows will be increased who go after another god i will not take drink offerings from their hands or take their names on my lips
 the lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup you are the supporter of my right
 fair are the places marked out for me i have a noble heritage
 i will give praise to the lord who has been my guide knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night
 i have put the lord before me at all times because he is at my right hand i will not be moved
 because of this my heart is glad and my glory is full of joy while my flesh takes its rest in hope
 for you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld you will not let your loved one see the place of death
 you will make clear to me the way of life where you are joy is complete in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever
