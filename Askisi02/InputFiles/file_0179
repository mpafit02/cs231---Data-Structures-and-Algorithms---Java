 and he made his disciples come to him and said to them truly i say to you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box
 because they all put in something out of what they had no need for but she out of her need put in all she had even all her living
 and when he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said to him master see what stones and what buildings 
 and jesus said to him do you see these great buildings there is not one stone here resting on another which will not be overturned
 and while he was seated on the mountain of olives opposite the temple peter and james and john and andrew said to him privately
 say when these things will be and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be done
 and jesus said to them take care that you are not tricked by anyone
 people will come in my name saying i am he and a number will be turned from the true way
 and when you have news of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled these things have to be but it is still not the end
 nation will go to war with nation and kingdom with kingdom there will be earth shocks in different places there will be times when there is no food these things are the first of the troubles
 but take care for they will give you up to the sanhedrins and in synagogues you will be whipped and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me for a sign to them
 and the good news has first to be given to all the nations
 and when you are taken and given up to be judged do not be troubled about what to say but whatever is given to you in that hour say because it is not you who say it but the holy spirit
 and brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
 and you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who goes through to the end will have salvation
 but when you see the unclean thing which makes destruction in the place where it has no right to be  let this be clear to the reader  then let those who are in judaea go quickly to the mountains
 and let him who is on the house top not go down or go in to take anything out of his house
 and let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat
 and it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days
 and say a prayer that it may not be in the winter
 for in those days there will be sorrow such as there has not been from the time when god made the world till now and will not ever be again
 and if the lord had not made the time short no flesh would have been kept from destruction but because of the saints he has made the time short
 and then if any man says to you see here is christ or see there have no faith in it
 because there will be false christs and false prophets and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way
 but take care see i have made all things clear to you before the time
 but in those days after that time of trouble the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light
 and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers which are in the heavens will be moved
 and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
 and then he will send out the angels and will get together his saints from the four winds from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven
 take an example from the fig tree when its branches become soft and put out their leaves you see that the summer is near
