 and david said solomon my son is young and untested and the house which is to be put up for the lord is to be very great a thing of wonder and glory through all countries so i will make ready what is needed for it so david got ready a great store of material before his death
 then he sent for his son solomon and gave him orders for the building of a house for the lord the god of israel
 and david said to solomon my son it was my desire to put up a house for the name of the lord my god
 but the word of the lord came to me saying you have taken lives without number and made great wars i will not let you be the builder of a house for my name because of the lives you have taken on the earth before my eyes
 but you will have a son who will be a man of rest and i will give him rest from wars on every side his name will be solomon and in his time i will give israel peace and quiet
 he will be the builder of a house for my name he will be to me a son and i will be to him a father and i will make the seat of his rule over israel certain for ever
 now my son may the lord be with you and may you do well and put up the house of the lord your god as he has said of you
 only may the lord give you wisdom and knowledge of his orders for israel so that you may keep the law of the lord your god
 and all will go well for you if you take care to keep the laws and the rules which the lord gave to moses for israel be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled
 now see poor though i am i have got ready for the house of the lord a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver and a weight of brass and iron greater than may be measured and wood and stone have i made ready and you may put more to it
 and you have a great number of workmen cutters and workers of stone and wood and experts in every sort of work
 in gold and silver and brass and iron more than may be numbered up  then and to work and may the lord be with you
 then david gave orders to all the chiefs of israel to give their help to solomon his son saying
 is not the lord your god with you and has he not given you rest on every side for the lord has given the people of the land into my hands and the land is overcome before the lord and before his people
 now give your heart and soul to the worship of the lord your god and get to work on the building of the holy place of the lord god so that you may put the ark of the lords agreement and the holy vessels of god in the house which is to be made for the name of the lord
 now david was old and full of days and he made his son solomon king over israel
 and he got together all the chiefs of israel with the priests and the levites
 and the levites all those of thirty years old and over were numbered and the number of them by heads man by man was thirty eight thousand
 of these twenty four thousand were to be overseers of the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were judges and men of authority
 four thousand were door keepers and four thousand gave praise to the lord with the instruments which i made said david for giving praise
 and david put them into divisions under the names of the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
 of the gershonites ladan and shimei
 the sons of ladan jehiel the chief and zetham and joel three
 the sons of shimei shelomoth and haziel and haran three these were the heads of the families of ladan
 and the sons of shimei jahath zizah and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei
 jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had only a small number of sons so they were grouped together as one family
 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four
 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was made separate and holy he and his sons for ever for the care of the most holy things and the burning of offerings before the lord to do his work and give blessings in his name for ever
 and the sons of moses the man of god were put into the list of the tribe of levi
 the sons of moses gershom and eliezer
