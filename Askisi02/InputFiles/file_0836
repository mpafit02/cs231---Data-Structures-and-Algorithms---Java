 and if after all this you do not give ear to me but go against me still
 then my wrath will be burning against you and i will give you punishment i myself seven times for your sins
 then you will take the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters for food
 and i will send destruction on your high places overturning your perfume altars and will put your dead bodies on your broken images and my soul will be turned from you in disgust
 and i will make your towns waste and send destruction on your holy places i will take no pleasure in the smell of your sweet perfumes
 and i will make your land a waste a wonder to your haters living in it
 and i will send you out in all directions among the nations and my sword will be uncovered against you and your land will be without any living thing and your towns will be made waste
 then will the land take pleasure in its sabbaths while it is waste and you are living in the land of your haters then will the land have rest
 all the days while it is waste will the land have rest such rest as it never had in your sabbaths when you were living in it
 and as for the rest of you i will make their hearts feeble in the land of their haters and the sound of a leaf moved by the wind will send them in flight and they will go in flight as from the sword falling down when no one comes after them
 falling on one another as before the sword when no one comes after them you will give way before your haters
 and death will overtake you among strange nations and the land of your haters will be your destruction
 and those of you who are still living will be wasting away in their sins in the land of your haters in the sins of their fathers they will be wasting away
 and they will have grief for their sins and for the sins of their fathers when their hearts were untrue to me and they went against me
 so that i went against them and sent them away into the land of their haters if then the pride of their hearts is broken and they take the punishment of their sins
 then i will keep in mind the agreement which i made with jacob and with isaac and with abraham and i will keep in mind the land
 and the land while she is without them will keep her sabbaths and they will undergo the punishment of their sins because they were turned away from my decisions and in their souls was hate for my laws
 but for all that when they are in the land of their haters i will not let them go or be turned away from them or give them up completely my agreement with them will not be broken for i am the lord their god
 and because of them i will keep in mind the agreement which i made with their fathers whom i took out of the land of egypt before the eyes of the nations to be their god i am the lord
 these are the rules decisions and laws which the lord made between himself and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a man makes a special oath you will give your decision as to the value of the persons for the lord
 and you will put the value of a male from twenty years to sixty years old at fifty shekels of silver by the scale of the holy place
 and if it is a female the value will be thirty shekels
 and if the person is from five to twenty years old the value will be twenty shekels for a male and ten for a female
 and if the person is from one month to five years old then the value for a male will be five shekels of silver and for a female three shekels
 and for sixty years old and over for a male the value will be fifteen shekels and for a female ten
 but if he is poorer than the value which you have put on him then let him be taken to the priest and the priest will put a value on him such as it is possible for him to give
 and if it is a beast of which men make offerings to the lord whatever any man gives of such to the lord will be holy
 it may not be changed in any way a good given for a bad or a bad for a good if one beast is changed for another the two will be holy
