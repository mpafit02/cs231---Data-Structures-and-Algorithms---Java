 and when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day he sent them into his vine garden
 and he went out about the third hour and saw others in the market place doing nothing
 and he said to them go into the vine garden with the others and whatever is right i will give you and they went to work
 again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same
 and about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing and he says to them why are you here all the day doing nothing
 they say to him because no man has given us work he says to them go in with the rest into the vine garden
 and when evening came the lord of the vine garden said to his manager let the workers come and give them their payment from the last to the first
 and when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour they were given every man a penny
 then those who came first had the idea that they would get more and they like the rest were given a penny
 and when they got it they made a protest against the master of the house
 saying these last have done only one hours work and you have made them equal to us who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat
 but he in answer said to one of them friend i do you no wrong did you not make an agreement with me for a penny
 take what is yours and go away it is my pleasure to give to this last even as to you
 have i not the right to do as seems good to me in my house or is your eye evil because i am good
 so the last will be first and the first last
 and when jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples on one side and said to them
 see we go up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and they will give orders for him to be put to death
 and will give him up to the gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross and the third day he will come back again from the dead
 then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons giving him worship and making a request of him
 and he said to her what is your desire she says to him let my two sons be seated the one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom
 but jesus made answer and said you have no idea what you are requesting are you able to take of the cup which i am about to take
 they say to him we are able he says to them truly you will take of my cup but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom my father has made it ready
 and when it came to the ears of the ten they were angry with the two brothers
 but jesus said to them you see that the rulers of the gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
 let it not be so among you but if anyone has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
 and whoever has a desire to be first among you let him take the lowest place
 even as the son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
 and when they were going out from jericho a great number went after him
 and two blind men seated by the wayside when they had the news that jesus was going by gave a loud cry saying lord son of david have mercy on us
 and the people gave them orders to be quiet but they went on crying even louder lord son of david have mercy on us
