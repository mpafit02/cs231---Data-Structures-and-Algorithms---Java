 even so when you see these things taking place you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
 truly i say to you this generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
 heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
 but of that day or that hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the son but the father
 take care keep watch with prayer for you are not certain when the time will be
 it is as when a man who is in another country for a time having gone away from his house and given authority to his servants and to everyone his work gives the porter an order to keep watch
 so you are to keep watch because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming in the evening or in the middle of the night or at the cocks cry or in the morning
 for fear that coming suddenly he sees you sleeping
 and what i say to you i say to all keep watch
 it was now two days before the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death
 but they said not while the feast is going on for fear there may be trouble among the people
 and while he was in bethany in the house of simon the leper seated at table there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head
 but some of them were angry among themselves saying for what purpose has this oil been wasted
 we might have got more than three hundred pence for it and given the money to the poor and they said things against her among themselves
 but jesus said let her be why are you troubling her she has done a kind act to me
 the poor you have ever with you and whenever you have the desire you may do them good but me you have not for ever
 she has done what she was able she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting place
 and truly i say to you wherever the good news goes out through all the earth what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
 and judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went away to the chief priests so that he might give him up to them
 and hearing what he said they were glad and gave him their word to make him a payment of money and he took thought how he might best give him up to them
 and on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is put to death his disciples said to him where are we to go and make ready for you to take the passover meal
 and he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the town and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water go after him
 and wherever he goes in say to the owner of the house the master says where is my guest room where i may take the passover with my disciples
 and he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats there make ready for us
 and the disciples went out and came into the town and saw that it was as he had said and they made ready the passover
 and when it was evening he came with the twelve
 and while they were seated taking food jesus said truly i say to you one of you will be false to me one who is taking food with me
 they were sad and said to him one by one is it i
 and he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate
 the son of man goes even as the writings say of him but cursed is that man through whom the son of man is given up  it would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth
