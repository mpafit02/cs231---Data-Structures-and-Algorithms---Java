 and a number of women were there watching from a distance who had come with jesus from galilee waiting on his needs
 among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of the sons of zebedee
 and in the evening there came a man of wealth from arimathaea joseph by name who was a disciple of jesus
 this man went in to pilate and made a request for the body of jesus then pilate gave orders for it to be given to him
 and joseph took the body folding it in clean linen
 and put it in the resting place which had been cut out of the rock for himself and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away
 and mary magdalene was there and the other mary seated by the place of the dead
 now on the day after the getting ready of the passover the chief priests and pharisees came together to pilate
 saying sir we have in mind how that false man said while he was still living after three days i will come again from the dead
 give orders then that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people he has come back from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first
 pilate said to them you have watchmen go and make it as safe as you are able
 so they went and made safe the place where his body was putting a stamp on the stone and the watchmen were with them
 now late on the sabbath when the dawn of the first day of the week was near mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the place where his body was
 and there was a great earth shock for an angel of the lord came down from heaven and rolling back the stone took his seat on it
 his form was shining like the light and his clothing was white as snow
 and for fear of him the watchmen were shaking and became as dead men
 and the angel said to the women have no fear for i see that you are searching for jesus who was put to death on the cross
 he is not here for he has come to life again even as he said come see the lords resting place
 and go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead and is going before you into galilee there you will see him as i have said to you
 and they went away quickly with fear and great joy to give his disciples the news
 and on the way jesus came to them saying be glad and they came and put their hands on his feet and gave him worship
 then said jesus to them have no fear go and give word to my brothers to go into galilee and there they will see me
 now while they were going some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place
 and when they had come together with those in authority and had made their decision they gave much money to the watchmen saying
 say his disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping
 and if this comes to the rulers ears we will see that he does not make you responsible
 so they took the money and did as they had been ordered and this account has been current among the jews till the present time
 but the eleven disciples went into galilee to the mountain where jesus had given them orders to go
 and when they saw him they gave him worship but some were in doubt
 and jesus came to them and said all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
