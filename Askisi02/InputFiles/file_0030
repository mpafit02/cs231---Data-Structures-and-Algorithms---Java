 he who has the son has the life he who has not the son of god has not the life
 i have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the son of god so that you may be certain that you have eternal life
 and we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes he will give ear to us
 and if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests we are equally certain that we will get our requests
 if a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death let him make a prayer to god and god will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death there is a sin whose punishment is death i do not say that he may make such a request then
 all evil doing is sin but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin
 we are certain that one who is a child of god will do no sin but the son of god keeps him so that he is not touched by the evil one
 we are certain that we are of god but all the world is in the power of the evil one
 and we are certain that the son of god has come and has given us a clear vision so that we may see him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ he is the true god and eternal life
 my little children keep yourselves from false gods
 i a ruler in the church send word to the noble sister who is of gods selection and to her children for whom i have true love and not only i but all who have knowledge of what is true
 because of this true knowledge which is in us and will be with us for ever
 may grace mercy and peace be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the son of the father in all true love
 it gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way even as we were ordered to do by the father
 and now my sister i make a request to you not sending you a new law but the law which we had from the first that we have love for one another
 and love is the keeping of his laws this is the law which was given to you from the first so that you might keep it
 because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world who do not give witness that jesus christ came in the flesh such a one is a false teacher and antichrist
 keep watch over yourselves so that you do not make our work of no effect but may get your full reward
 anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of christ has not god he who keeps to the teaching has the father and the son
 if anyone comes to you not having this teaching do not take him into your house or give him words of love
 for he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works
 having much to say to you it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink but i am hoping to come to you and to have talk with you face to face so that your joy may be full
 the children of your noble sister who is of gods selection send you their love
 i a ruler in the church send word to the well loved gaius for whom i have true love
 my loved one it is my prayer that you may do well in all things and be healthy in body even as your soul does well
 for it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way
 i have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way
 my loved one you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places
 who have given witness to the church of your love for them and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for as is right for servants of god
 for they went out for love of the name taking nothing from the gentiles
