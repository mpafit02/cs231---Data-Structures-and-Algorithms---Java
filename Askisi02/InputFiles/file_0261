 looking for the glad hope the revelation of the glory of our great god and saviour jesus christ
 who gave himself for us so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works
 on all these points give teaching and help and make clear what is right with all authority let all men give you honour
 make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities to do what they are ordered to be ready for every good work
 to say no evil of any man not to be fighters to give way to others to be gentle in behaviour to all men
 for in the past we were foolish hard in heart turned from the true way servants of evil desires and pleasures living in bad feeling and envy hated and hating one another
 but when the mercy of god our saviour and his love to man was seen
 not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves but in the measure of his mercy he gave us salvation through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the holy spirit
 which he gave us freely through jesus christ our saviour
 so that having been given righteousness through grace we might have a part in the heritage the hope of eternal life
 this is a true saying and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things so that those who have had faith in god may give attention to good works these things are good and of profit to men
 but have nothing to do with foolish questionings and lists of generations and fights and arguments about the law for they are of no profit and foolish
 a man whose opinions are not those of the church after a first and second protest is to be kept out of your society
 clearly he is in error and a sinner being self judged
 when i send artemas or tychicus to you do your best to come to me at nicopolis for it is my purpose to be there for the winter
 send zenas the man of law and apollos on their journey with all care so that they may be in need of nothing
 and let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes so that they may not be without fruit
 all who are with me send you their love give our love to our friends in the faith grace be with you all
 paul and timothy servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus at philippi with the bishops and deacons of the church
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to my god at every memory of you
 and in all my prayers for you all making my request with joy
 because of your help in giving the good news from the first day till now
 for i am certain of this very thing that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of jesus christ
 so it is right for me to take thought for you all in this way because i have you in my heart for in my chains and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news making clear that it is true you all have your part with me in grace
 for god is my witness how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of christ jesus
 and my prayer is that you may be increased more and more in knowledge and experience
 so that you may give your approval to the best things that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of christ
 being full of the fruits of righteousness which are through jesus christ to the glory and praise of god
 now it is my purpose to make clear to you brothers that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences
