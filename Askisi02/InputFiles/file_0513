 and he said i will make all the light of my being come before you and will make clear to you what i am i will be kind to those to whom i will be kind and have mercy on those on whom i will have mercy
 but it is not possible for you to see my face for no man may see me and still go on living
 and the lord said see there is a place near me and you may take your place on the rock
 and when my glory goes by i will put you in a hole in the rock covering you with my hand till i have gone past
 then i will take away my hand and you will see my back but my face is not to be seen
 and the lord said to moses make two other stones like the first two and i will put on them the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you
 and be ready by the morning and come up on mount sinai and come before me there in the morning on the top of the mountain
 no one is to come up with you and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot
 so moses got two stones cut like the first and early in the morning he went up mount sinai as the lord had said with the two stones in his hand
 and the lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of moses and moses gave worship to the name of the lord
 and the lord went past before his eyes saying the lord the lord a god full of pity and grace slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith
 having mercy on thousands overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin he will not let wrongdoers go free but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers and on their childrens children to the third and fourth generation
 then moses quickly went down on his face in worship
 and he said if now i have grace in your eyes let the lord go among us for this is a stiff necked people and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin and take us for your heritage
 and the lord said see this is what i will undertake before the eyes of your people i will do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation and all your people will see the work of the lord for what i am about to do for you is greatly to be feared
 take care to do the orders which i give you today i will send out from before you the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 but take care and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going for it will be a cause of sin to you
 but their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down
 for you are to be worshippers of no other god for the lord is a god who will not give his honour to another
 so see that you make no agreement with the people of the land and do not go after their gods or take part in their offerings or be guests at their feasts
 or take their daughters for your sons for when their daughters give worship before their gods they will make your sons take part with them
 make for yourselves no gods of metal
 keep the feast of unleavened bread for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven as i gave you orders at the regular time in the month abib for in that month you came out of egypt
 every first male child is mine the first male birth of your cattle the first male of every ox and sheep
 a lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass but if you will not make payment for it its neck will have to be broken for all the first of your sons you are to make payment no one is to come before me without an offering
 six days let work be done but on the seventh day take your rest at ploughing time and at the grain cutting you are to have a day for rest
 and you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first fruits of the grain and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields
 three times in the year let all your males come before the lord the god of israel
 for i will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the lord three times in the year
 no leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering and the offering of the passover feast may not be kept till the morning
