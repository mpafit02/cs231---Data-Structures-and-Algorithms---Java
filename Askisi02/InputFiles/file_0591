 now then give me your oath in the name of god that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me but that as i have been good to you so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living
 and abraham said i will give you my oath
 but abraham made a protest to abimelech because of a water hole which abimelechs servants had taken by force
 but abimelech said i have no idea who has done this thing you never gave me word of it and i had no knowledge of it till this day
 and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to abimelech and the two of them made an agreement together
 and abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves
 then abimelech said what are these seven lambs which you have put on one side
 and he said take these seven lambs from me as a witness that i have made this water hole
 so he gave that place the name beer sheba because there the two of them had given their oaths
 so they made an agreement at beer sheba and abimelech and phicol the captain of his army went back to the land of the philistines
 and abraham after planting a holy tree in beer sheba gave worship to the name of the lord the eternal god
 and abraham went on living in the land of the philistines as in a strange country
 now after these things god put abraham to the test and said to him abraham and he said here am i
 and he said to him take your son your dearly loved only son isaac and go to the land of moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which i will give you knowledge
 and abraham got up early in the morning and made ready his ass and took with him two of his young men and isaac his son and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut he went on his way to the place of which god had given him word
 and on the third day abraham lifting up his eyes saw the place a long way off
 then he said to his young men keep here with the ass and i and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you
 and abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his sons back and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand and the two of them went on together
 then isaac said to abraham my father and he said here am i my son and he said we have wood and fire here but where is the lamb for the burned offering
 and abraham said god himself will give the lamb for the burned offering so they went on together
 and they came to the place of which god had given him knowledge and there abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it and having made tight the bands round isaac his son he put him on the wood on the altar
 and stretching out his hand abraham took the knife to put his son to death
 but the voice of the angel of the lord came from heaven saying abraham abraham and he said here am i
 and he said let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him for now i am certain that the fear of god is in your heart because you have not kept back your son your only son from me
 and lifting up his eyes abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood and abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son
 and abraham gave that place the name yahweh yireh as it is said to this day in the mountain the lord is seen
 and the voice of the angel of the lord came to abraham a second time from heaven
 saying i have taken an oath by my name says the lord because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son
 that i will certainly give you my blessing and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside your seed will take the land of those who are against them
 and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth because you have done what i gave you orders to do
