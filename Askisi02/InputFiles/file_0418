 after him was eleazar the son of dodai the ahohite one of the three great fighters who was with david in pas dammim when the philistines came together there for the fight and when the men of israel had gone in flight
 he was with david and went on fighting the philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his sword and that day the lord gave a great salvation and the people came back after him only to take the goods of the philistines
 after him was shammah the son of ela the hararite and the philistines came together in lehi where there was a bit of land full of seed and the people went in flight from the philistines
 but he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the philistines and the lord gave a great salvation
 and three of the thirty went down at the start of the grain cutting and they came to david at the strong place of adullam and the band of philistines had taken up their position in the valley of rephaim
 and at that time david had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the philistines was in beth lehem
 and david moved by a strong desire said if only someone would give me a drink of water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town 
 and the three men forcing their way through the philistine army got water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to david but he would not take it but draining it out made an offering of it to the lord
 and he said far be it from me o lord to do this how may i take as my drink the life blood of men who have put their lives in danger so he would not take it these things did the three great men of war
