 o have love for the lord all you his saints for the lord keeps safe from danger all those who are true to him and gives the workers of pride their right reward
 put away fear and let your heart be strong all you whose hope is in the lord
 &ltof david maschil&gt happy is he who has forgiveness for his wrongdoing and whose sin is covered
 happy is the man in whom the lord sees no evil and in whose spirit there is no deceit
 when i kept my mouth shut my bones were wasted because of my crying all through the day
 for the weight of your hand was on me day and night my body became dry like the earth in summer  selah 
 i made my wrongdoing clear to you and did not keep back my sin i said i will put it all before the lord and you took away my wrongdoing and my sin  selah 
 for this cause let every saint make his prayer to you at a time when you are near then the overflowing of the great waters will not overtake him
 you are my safe and secret place you will keep me from trouble you will put songs of salvation on the lips of those who are round me  selah 
 i will give you knowledge teaching you the way to go my eye will be your guide
 do not be like the horse or the ass without sense 
 the sinner will be full of trouble but mercy will be round the man who has faith in the lord
 be glad in the lord with joy you upright men give cries of joy all you whose hearts are true
 be glad in the lord o doers of righteousness for praise is beautiful for the upright
 give praise to the lord on the corded instrument make melody to him with instruments of music
 make a new song to him playing expertly with a loud noise
 for the word of the lord is upright and all his works are certain
 his delight is in righteousness and wisdom the earth is full of the mercy of the lord
 by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth
 he makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass he keeps the deep seas in store houses
 let the earth be full of the fear of the lord let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him
 for he gave the word and it was done by his order it was fixed for ever
 the lord undoes the designs of the nations he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect
 the lords purpose is eternal the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man
 happy is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he has taken for his heritage
 the lord is looking down from heaven he sees all the sons of men
 from his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth
 he makes all their hearts their works are clear to him
 a kings salvation is not in the power of his army a strong man does not get free by his great strength
 a horse is a false hope his great power will not make any man free from danger
