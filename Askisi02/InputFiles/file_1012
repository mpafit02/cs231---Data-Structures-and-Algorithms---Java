 let their faces be full of shame so that they may give honour to your name o lord
 let them be overcome and troubled for ever let them be put to shame and come to destruction
 so that men may see that you only whose name is yahweh are most high over all the earth
 &ltto the chief music maker put to the gittith a psalm of the sons of korah&gt how dear are your tents o lord of armies 
 the passion of my souls desire is for the house of the lord my heart and my flesh are crying out for the living god
 the little birds have places for themselves where they may put their young even your altars o lord of armies my king and my god
 happy are they whose resting place is in your house they will still be praising you  selah 
 happy is the man whose strength is in you in whose heart are the highways to zion
 going through the valley of balsam trees they make it a place of springs it is clothed with blessings by the early rain
 they go from strength to strength every one of them comes before god in zion
 o lord god of armies let my prayer come to you give ear o god of jacob  selah 
 o god let your eyes be on him who is our safe cover and let your heart be turned to your king
 for a day in your house is better than a thousand it is better to be a door keeper in the house of my god than to be living in the tents of sin
 the lord god is our sun and our strength the lord will give grace and glory he will not keep back any good thing from those whose ways are upright
 o lord of armies happy is the man whose hope is in you
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of the sons of korah&gt lord you were good to your land changing the fate of jacob
 the wrongdoing of your people had forgiveness all their sin had been covered  selah 
 you were no longer angry you were turned from the heat of your wrath
 come back to us o god of our salvation and be angry with us no longer
 will you go on being angry with us for ever will you keep your wrath against us through all the long generations
 will you not give us life again so that your people may be glad in you
 let us see your mercy o lord and give us your salvation
 i will give ear to the voice of the lord for he will say words of peace to his people and to his saints but let them not go back to their foolish ways
 truly his salvation is near to his worshippers so that glory may be in our land
 mercy and faith have come together righteousness and peace have given one another a kiss
 faith comes up from the earth like a plant righteousness is looking down from heaven
 the lord will give what is good and our land will give its increase
 righteousness will go before him making a way for his footsteps
 &lta prayer of david&gt let your ears be open to my voice o lord and give me an answer for i am poor and in need
 keep my soul for i am true to you o my god give salvation to your servant whose hope is in you
