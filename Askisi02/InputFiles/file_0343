 then david said to achish if now i have grace in your eyes let me have a place in one of the smaller towns of your land to be my living place for it is not right for your servant to be living with you in the kings town
 so achish straight away gave him ziklag and for that reason ziklag has been the property of the kings of judah to this day
 and david was living in the land of the philistines for the space of a year and four months
 and david and his men went up and made attacks on the geshurites and the girzites and the amalekites for these were the people who were living in the land from telam on the way to shur as far as egypt
 and david again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was still living and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing and he came back to achish
 and every time achish said where have you been fighting today david said against the south of judah and the south of the jerahmeelites and the south of the kenites
 not one living man or woman did david ever take back with him to gath fearing that they might give an account of what had taken place and say this is what david did and so has he been doing all the time while he has been living in the land of the philistines
 and achish had belief in what david said saying he has made himself hated by all his people israel and so he will be my servant for ever
 now in those days the philistines got their forces together to make war on israel and achish said to david certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight
 and david said to achish you will see now what your servant will do and achish said to david then i will make you keeper of my head for ever
 now samuel was dead and all israel after weeping for him had put his body in its last resting place in ramah his town and saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts
 and the philistines came together and put their forces in position in shunem and saul got all israel together and they took up their positions in gilboa
 and when saul saw the philistine army he was troubled and his heart was moved with fear
 and when saul went for directions to the lord the lord gave him no answer by a dream or by the urim or by the prophets
 then saul said to his servants get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that i may go to her and get directions and his servants said to him there is such a woman at en dor
 so saul putting on other clothing so that he might not be seen to be the king took two men with him and went to the woman by night and he said now with the help of the spirit which you have make the person whose name i will give you come up
 and the woman said to him but you have knowledge of what saul has done how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts why would you by a trick put me in danger of death
 and saul made an oath to her by the lord saying by the living lord no punishment will come to you for this
 then the woman said who am i to let you see and he said make samuel come up for me
 and the woman saw that it was saul and she gave a loud cry and said to saul why have you made use of deceit for you are saul
 and the king said to her have no fear what do you see and the woman said to saul i see a god coming up out of the earth
 and he said to her what is his form and she said it is an old man coming up covered with a robe and saul saw that it was samuel and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour
 and samuel said to saul why have you made me come up troubling my rest and saul in answer said i am in great danger for the philistines are making war on me and god has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer by the prophets or by dreams so i have sent for you to make clear to me what i am to do
 and samuel said why do you put your questions to me seeing that god has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you
 and the lord himself has done what i said the lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour david
 because you did not do what the lord said and did not give effect to his burning wrath against amalek so the lord has done this thing to you today
 and more than this the lord will give israel up with you into the hands of the philistines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me and the lord will give up the army of israel into the hands of the philistines
 then saul went down flat on the earth and was full of fear because of samuels words and there was no strength in him for he had taken no food all that day or all that night
 and the woman came to saul and saw that he was in great trouble and said to him see now your servant has given ear to your words and i have put my life in danger by doing what you said
 so now give ear to the voice of your servant and let me give you a little bread and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way
