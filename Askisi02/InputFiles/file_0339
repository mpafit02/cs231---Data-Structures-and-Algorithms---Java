 so david and his men went to keilah and had a fight with the philistines and took away their cattle and put them to the sword with great destruction so david was the saviour of the people of keilah
 now when abiathar the son of ahimelech went in flight to david he came down to keilah with the ephod in his hand
 and news was given to saul that david had come to keilah and saul said now god has given him into my hands for by going into a walled town with locked doors he has let himself be shut in
 and saul sent for all the people to come to the fight and go down to keilah to make an attack on david and his men
 and it was clear to david that saul had evil designs against him and he said to abiathar the priest come here with the ephod
 then david said o lord the god of israel news has been given to your servant that it is sauls purpose to come to keilah and send destruction on the town because of me
 and now is it true as they have said to me that saul is coming o lord the god of israel give ear to your servant and say if these things are so and the lord said he is coming down
 then david said will the men of keilah give me and my men up to saul and the lord said they will give you up
 then david and his men about six hundred of them went out of keilah and got away wherever they were able to go and saul hearing that david had got away from keilah did not go there
 and david kept in the waste land in safe places waiting in the hill country in the waste land of ziph and saul was searching for him every day but god did not give him up into his hands
 and david was full of fear in the knowledge that saul had come out to take his life and david was in the waste land of ziph in horesh
 and sauls son jonathan went to david in horesh and made his hands strong in god
 and said to him have no fear for saul my father will not get you into his power and you will be king of israel and i will be by your side and my father saul is certain of this
 and the two of them made an agreement before the lord and david went on living in horesh and jonathan went back to his house
 then the ziphites came up to gibeah to see saul and said is not david living secretly among us in the strong places in horesh in the hill of hachilah to the south of the waste land
 so now o king have your souls desire and come down and we for our part will give him up into the kings hands
 and saul said the lords blessing will be yours for you have had pity on me
 go now and take more steps and see where he is living for they say that he is expert in deceit
 so take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover and be certain to come back to me and i will go with you and without doubt if he is anywhere in the land i will get him among all the families of judah
 and they went back and came to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the waste land of maon in the dry land south of the waste land
 and saul and his men went in search of him and david had word of it so he came down to the rock in the waste land of maon and saul hearing of this went after david into the waste land of maon
 and saul and his men went on one side of the mountain and david and his men went on the other and davids purpose was to get away as quickly as possible for fear of saul for saul and his men were making a circle round david and his men in order to take them
 but a man came to saul saying be quick and come for the philistines have made an attack on the land
 so turning back from going after david saul went against the philistines so that place was named sela hammah lekoth
 and from there david went up and took cover in the safe place of en gedi
 now when saul came back from fighting the philistines news was given him that david was in the waste land of en gedi
 then saul took three thousand of the best men out of all israel and went in search of david and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats
 and on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept where there was a hollow in the rock and saul went in for a private purpose now david and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow
 and davids men said to him now is the time when the lord says to you i will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you then david getting up took the skirt of sauls robe in his hand cutting off the end of it without his knowledge
 and later david was full of regret for cutting off sauls skirt
