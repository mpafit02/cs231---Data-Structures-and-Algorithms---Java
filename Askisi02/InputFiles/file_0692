 is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments or a bride her robes but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days
 with what care are your ways ordered when you are looking for love  so  your ways
 and in the skirts of your robe may be seen the life blood of those who have done no wrong 
 and still you said i have done no wrong truly his wrath is turned away from me see i will take up the cause against you because you say i have done no wrong
 why do you go about so much for the purpose of changing your way you will be shamed on account of egypt as you were shamed on account of assyria
 truly you will go out from him with your hands on your head for the lord has given up those in whom you have put your faith and they will be of no help to you
 now it came to the ears of pashhur the son of immer the priest who was chief in authority in the house of the lord that jeremiah was saying these things
 and pashhur gave blows to jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of benjamin which was in the house of the lord
 then on the day after pashhur let jeremiah loose then jeremiah said to him the lord has given you the name of magor missabib  cause of fear on every side  not pashhur
 for the lord has said see i will make you a cause of fear to yourself and to all your friends they will come to their death by the sword of their haters and your eyes will see it and i will give all judah into the hands of the king of babylon and he will take them away prisoners into babylon and put them to the sword
 and more than this i will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value even all the stores of the kings of judah will i give into the hands of their haters who will put violent hands on them and take them away to babylon
 and you pashhur and all who are in your house will go away prisoners you will come to babylon and there your body will be put to rest you and all your friends to whom you said false words
 o lord you have been false to me and i was tricked you are stronger than i and have overcome me i have become a thing to be laughed at all the day everyone makes sport of me
 for every word i say is a cry for help i say with a loud voice violent behaviour and wasting because the word of the lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day
 and if i say i will not keep him in mind i will not say another word in his name then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones and i am tired of keeping myself in i am not able to do it
 for numbers of them say evil secretly in my hearing  there is fear on every side  they say come let us give witness against him all my nearest friends who are watching for my fall say it may be that he will be taken by deceit and we will get the better of him and give him punishment
 but the lord is with me as a great one greatly to be feared so my attackers will have a fall and they will not overcome me they will be greatly shamed because they have not done wisely even with an unending shame kept in memory for ever
 but o lord of armies testing the upright and seeing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for i have put my cause before you
 make melody to the lord give praise to the lord for he has made the soul of the poor man free from the hands of the evil doers
 a curse on the day of my birth let there be no blessing on the day when my mother had me
 a curse on the man who gave the news to my father saying you have a male child making him very glad
 may that man be like the towns overturned by the lord without mercy let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning and the sound of war in the middle of the day
 because he did not put me to death before my birth took place so my mothers body would have been my last resting place and she would have been with child for ever
 why did i come from my mothers body to see pain and sorrow so that my days might be wasted with shame
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent to him pashhur the son of malchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
 will you get directions from the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon is making war against us it may be that the lord will do something for us like all the wonders he has done and make him go away from us
 then jeremiah said to them this is what you are to say to zedekiah
 the lord god of israel has said see i am turning back the instruments of war in your hands with which you are fighting against the king of babylon and the chaldaeans who are outside the walls and shutting you in and i will get them together inside this town
 and i myself will be fighting against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even with angry feeling and passion and in great wrath
 and i will send a great disease on the people living in this town on man and on beast causing their death
