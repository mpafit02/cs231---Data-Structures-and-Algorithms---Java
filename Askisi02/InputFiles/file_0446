 it will be your food like the gazelle and the roe the unclean and the clean may take of it
 but see that you do not take the blood for food for the blood is the life and you may not make use of the life as food with the flesh
 do not take it for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
 do not take it for food so that it may be well for you and for your children after you while you do what is right in the eyes of the lord
 but the holy things which you have and the offerings of your oaths you are to take to the place which will be marked out by the lord
 offering the flesh and the blood of your burned offerings on the altar of the lord your god and the blood of your offerings is to be drained out on the altar of the lord your god and the flesh will be your food
 take note of all these orders i am giving you and give attention to them so that it may be well for you and for your children after you for ever while you do what is good and right in the eyes of the lord your god
 when the people of the land where you are going have been cut off before you by the lord your god and you have taken their land and are living in it
 after their destruction take care that you do not go in their ways and that you do not give thought to their gods saying how did these nations give worship to their gods i will do as they did
 do not so to the lord your god for everything which is disgusting to the lord and hated by him they have done in honour of their gods even burning their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods
 you are to keep with care all the words i give you making no addition to them and taking nothing from them
 if ever you have among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder
 and the sign or the wonder takes place and he says to you let us go after other gods which are strange to you and give them worship
 then give no attention to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god is testing you to see if all the love of your heart and soul is given to him
 but keep on in the ways of the lord your god fearing him and keeping his orders and hearing his voice worshipping him and being true to him
 and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is to be put to death for his words were said with the purpose of turning you away from the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt and made you free from the prison house and of forcing you out of the way in which the lord your god has given you orders to go so you are to put away the evil from among you
 if your brother the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or the wife of your heart or the friend who is as dear to you as your life working on you secretly says to you let us go and give worship to other gods strange to you and to your fathers
 gods of the peoples round about you near or far from one end of the earth to the other
 do not be guided by him or give attention to him have no pity on him or mercy and give him no cover
 but put him to death without question let your hand be the first stretched out against him to put him to death and then the hands of all the people
 let him be stoned with stones till he is dead because it was his purpose to make you false to the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 and all israel hearing of it will be full of fear and no one will again do such evil as this among you
 and if word comes to you in one of the towns which the lord your god is giving you for your resting place
 that good for nothing persons have gone out from among you turning the people of their town from the right way and saying let us go and give worship to other gods of whom you have no knowledge
 then let a full search be made and let questions be put with care and if it is true and certain that such a disgusting thing has been done among you
 then take up arms against the people of that town and give it up to the curse with all its cattle and everything in it
 and take all the goods into the middle of its open space burning the town and all its property with fire as an offering to the lord your god it is to be a waste for ever there is to be no more building there
 keep not a thing of what is cursed for yourselves so the lord may be turned away from the heat of his wrath and have mercy on you and give you increase as he said in his oath to your fathers
 so long as you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and keep all his orders which i give you today and do what is right in the eyes of the lord your god
 you are the children of the lord your god you are not to make cuts on your bodies or take off the hair on your brows in honour of the dead
