 they put the altar on its base for fear was on them because of the people of the countries and they made burned offerings on it to the lord even burned offerings morning and evening
 and they kept the feast of tents as it is recorded making the regular burned offerings every day by number as it is ordered for every day what was needed
 and after that the regular burned offering and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the lord which had been made holy and the offering of everyone who freely gave his offering to the lord
 from the first day of the seventh month they made a start with the burned offerings but the base of the temple of the lord had still not been put in its place
 and they gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers and meat and drink and oil to the people of zidon and of tyre for the transport of cedar trees from lebanon to the sea to joppa as cyrus king of persia had given them authority to do
 now in the second year of their coming into the house of god in jerusalem in the second month the work was taken in hand by zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the levites and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to jerusalem and they made the levites of twenty years old and over responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the lord
 then jeshua with his sons and his brothers kadmiel with his sons the sons of hodaviah together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brothers the levites
 and when the builders put in position the base of the temple of the lord the priests dressed in their robes took their places with horns and the levites the sons of asaph with brass instruments to give praise to the lord in the way ordered by david king of israel
 and they gave praise to the lord answering one another in their songs and saying for he is good for his mercy to israel is eternal and all the people gave a great cry of joy when they gave praise to the lord because the base of the lords house was put in place
 but a number of the priests and levites and the heads of families old men who had seen the first house when the base of this house was put down before their eyes were overcome with weeping and a number were crying out with joy
 so that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off
 now news came to the haters of judah and benjamin that the people who had come back were building a temple to the lord the god of israel
 then they came to zerubbabel and to the heads of families and said to them let us take part in the building with you for we are servants of your god even as you are and we have been making offerings to him from the days of esar haddon king of assyria who put us here
 but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in israel said to them you have no part with us in the building of a house for our god we ourselves will do the work together for the lord the god of israel as cyrus king of persia has given us orders
 then the people of the land made the hands of the people of judah feeble troubling them with fear in their building
 and they gave payment to men who made designs against them and kept them from effecting their purpose all through the time of cyrus king of persia till darius became king
 and in the time of ahasuerus when he first became king they put on record a statement against the people of judah and jerusalem
 and in the time of artaxerxes bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of his friends sent a letter to artaxerxes king of persia writing it in the aramaean writing and language
 rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe sent a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king
 the letter was sent by rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe and their friends the dinaites and the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the shushanchites the dehaites the elamites
 and the rest of the nations which the great and noble osnappar took over and put in samaria and the rest of the country over the river
 this is a copy of the letter which they sent to artaxerxes the king your servants living across the river send these words
 we give news to the king that the jews who came from you have come to us at jerusalem they are building up again that uncontrolled and evil town the walls are complete and they are joining up the bases
 the king may be certain that when the building of this town and its walls is complete they will give no tax or payment in goods or forced payments and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings
 now because we are responsible to the king and it is not right for us to see the kings honour damaged we have sent to give the king word of these things
 so that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers and you will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled and a cause of trouble to kings and countries and that there were outbursts against authority there in the past for which reason the town was made waste
 we give you word that if the building of this town and its walls is made complete there will be an end of your power in the country across the river
 then the king sent an answer to rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe and their friends living in samaria and to the rest of those across the river saying peace to you
 and now the sense of the letter which you sent to us has been made clear to me
 and i gave orders for a search to be made and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings and that outbursts against authority have taken place there
