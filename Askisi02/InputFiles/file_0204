 for god said give honour to your father and mother and he who says evil of father or mother will be put to death
 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother that by which you might have had profit from me is given to god
 there is no need for him to give honour to his father and you have made the word of god without effect because of your teaching
 you false ones well did isaiah say of you
 these people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
 but their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
 and he got the people together and said to them give ear and let my words be clear to you
 not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean but that which comes out of the mouth
 then the disciples came and said to him did you see that the pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears
 but he said in answer every plant which my father in heaven has not put in the earth will be taken up by the roots
 let them be they are blind guides and if a blind man is guiding a blind man the two will go falling into a hole together
 then peter said to him make the story clear to us
 and he said are you like them still without wisdom
 do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach and is sent out as waste
 but the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart and they make a man unclean
 for out of the heart come evil thoughts the taking of life broken faith between the married unclean desires of the flesh taking of property false witness bitter words
 these are the things which make a man unclean but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean
 and jesus went away from there into the country of tyre and sidon
 and a woman of canaan came out from those parts crying and saying have pity on me o lord son of david my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit
 but he gave her no answer and his disciples came and said to him send her away for she is crying after us
 but he made answer and said i was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of israel
 but she came and gave him worship saying help lord
 and he made answer and said it is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
 but she said yes lord but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters table
 then jesus answering said to her o woman great is your faith let your desire be done and her daughter was made well from that hour
 and jesus went from there and came to the sea of galilee and he went up into the mountain and took his seat there
 and there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body or blind or without voice or wounded or ill in any way and a number of others they put them down at his feet and he made them well
 so that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking the feeble were made strong those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking and the blind were able to see and they gave glory to the god of israel
 and jesus got his disciples together and said i have pity for the people because they have now been with me three days and have no food and i will not send them away without food or they will have no strength for the journey
 and the disciples say to him how may we get enough bread in a waste place to give food to such a number of people
