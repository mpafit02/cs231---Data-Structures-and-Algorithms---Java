 whoever keeps a fig tree will have its fruit and the servant waiting on his master will be honoured
 like face looking at face in water so are the hearts of men to one another
 the underworld and abaddon are never full and the eyes of man have never enough
 the heating pot is for silver and the oven fire for gold and a man is measured by what he is praised for
 even if a foolish man is crushed with a hammer in a vessel among crushed grain still his foolish ways will not go from him
 take care to have knowledge about the condition of your flocks looking well after your herds
 for wealth is not for ever and money does not go on for all generations
 the grass comes up and the young grass is seen and the mountain plants are got in
 the lambs are for your clothing and the he goats make the value of a field
 there will be goats milk enough for your food and for the support of your servant girls
 the evil man goes running away when no man is after him but the upright are without fear like the lion
 because of the sin of the land its troubles are increased but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire
 a man of wealth who is cruel to the poor is like a violent rain causing destruction of food
 those who have no respect for the law give praise to the evil doer but such as keep the law are against him
 evil men have no knowledge of what is right but those who go after the lord have knowledge of all things
 better is the poor man whose ways are upright than the man of wealth whose ways are not straight
 he who keeps the law is a wise son but he who keeps company with feasters puts shame on his father
 he who makes his wealth greater by taking interest only gets it together for him who has pity on the poor
 as for the man whose ear is turned away from hearing the law even his prayer is disgusting
 anyone causing the upright to go wandering in an evil way will himself go down into the hole he has made but the upright will have good things for their heritage
 the man of wealth seems to himself to be wise but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him
 when the upright do well there is great glory but when evil doers are lifted up men do not let themselves be seen
 he who keeps his sins secret will not do well but one who is open about them and gives them up will get mercy
 happy is the man in whom is the fear of the lord at all times but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble
 like a loud voiced lion and a wandering bear is an evil ruler over a poor people
 the prince who has no sense is a cruel ruler but he who has no desire to get profit for himself will have long life
 one who has been the cause of a mans death will go in flight to the underworld let no man give him help
 he whose ways are upright will be safe but sudden will be the fall of him whose ways are twisted
 by ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure but he who goes after good for nothing persons will be poor enough
 a man of good faith will have great blessing but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment
