 i have still much to say to you but you are not strong enough for it now
 however when he the spirit of true knowledge has come he will be your guide into all true knowledge for his words will not come from himself but whatever has come to his hearing that he will say and he will make clear to you the things to come
 he will give me glory because he will take of what is mine and make it clear to you
 everything which the father has is mine that is why i say he will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you
 after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
 so some of the disciples said one to another what is this he is saying after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me and i am going to the father
 so they said again and again what is this he is saying a little time his words are not clear to us
 jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him so he said to them is this what you are questioning one with another why i said after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
 truly i say to you you will be weeping and sorrowing but the world will be glad you will be sad but your sorrow will be turned into joy
 when a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow because her hour is come but when she has given birth to the child the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world
 so you have sorrow now but i will see you again and your hearts will be glad and no one will take away your joy
 and on that day you will put no questions to me truly i say to you whatever request you make to the father he will give it to you in my name
 up to now you have made no request in my name do so and it will be answered so that your hearts may be full of joy
 all this i have said to you in veiled language but the time is coming when i will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the father clearly
 in that day you will make requests in my name and i do not say that i will make prayer to the father for you
 for the father himself gives his love to you because you have given your love to me and have had faith that i came from god
 i came out from the father and have come into the world again i go away from the world and go to the father
 his disciples said now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language
 now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you through this we have faith that you came from god
 jesus made answer have you faith now
 see a time is coming yes it is now here when you will go away in all directions every man to his house and i will be by myself but i am not by myself because the father is with me
 i have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you have trouble but take heart  i have overcome the world
 jesus said these things then lifting his eyes to heaven he said father the time has now come give glory to your son so that the son may give glory to you
 even as you gave him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him
 and this is eternal life to have knowledge of you the only true god and of him whom you have sent even jesus christ
 i have given you glory on the earth having done all the work which you gave me to do
 and now father let me have glory with you even that glory which i had with you before the world was
 i have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world yours they were and you gave them to me and they have kept your words
 now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you
 because i have given them the words which you gave to me and they have taken them to heart and have certain knowledge that i came from you and they have faith that you sent me
