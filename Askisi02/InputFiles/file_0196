 and the son of salmon by rahab was boaz and the son of boaz by ruth was obed and the son of obed was jesse
 and the son of jesse was david the king and the son of david was solomon by her who had been the wife of uriah
 and the son of solomon was rehoboam and the son of rehoboam was abijah and the son of abijah was asa
 and the son of asa was jehoshaphat and the son of jehoshaphat was joram and the son of joram was uzziah
 and the son of uzziah was jotham and the son of jotham was ahaz and the son of ahaz was hezekiah
 and the son of hezekiah was manasseh and the son of manasseh was amon and the son of amon was josiah
 and the sons of josiah were jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the taking away to babylon
 and after the taking away to babylon jechoniah had a son shealtiel and shealtiel had zerubbabel
 and zerubbabel had abiud and abiud had eliakim and eliakim had azor
 and azor had zadok and zadok had achim and achim had eliud
 and eliud had eleazar and eleazar had matthan and matthan had jacob
 and the son of jacob was joseph the husband of mary who gave birth to jesus whose name is christ
 so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the taking away to babylon fourteen generations and from the taking away to babylon to the coming of christ fourteen generations
 now the birth of jesus christ was in this way when his mother mary was going to be married to joseph before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the holy spirit
 and joseph her husband being an upright man and not desiring to make her a public example had a mind to put her away privately
 but when he was giving thought to these things an angel of the lord came to him in a dream saying joseph son of david have no fear of taking mary as your wife because that which is in her body is of the holy spirit
 and she will give birth to a son and you will give him the name jesus for he will give his people salvation from their sins
 now all this took place so that the word of the lord by the prophet might come true
 see the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will give him the name immanuel that is god with us
 and joseph did as the angel of the lord had said to him and took her as his wife
 and he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son and he gave him the name jesus
 and he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits and of making well all sorts of disease and pain
 now the names of the twelve are these the first simon who is named peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother
 philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax farmer james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus
 simon the zealot and judas iscariot who was false to him
 these twelve jesus sent out and gave them orders saying do not go among the gentiles or into any town of samaria
 but go to the wandering sheep of the house of israel
 and on your way say the kingdom of heaven is near
 make well those who are ill give life to the dead make lepers clean send evil spirits out of men freely it has been given to you freely give
 take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets
