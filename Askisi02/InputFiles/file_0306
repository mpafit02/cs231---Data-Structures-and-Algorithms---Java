 and ahab the son of omri did evil in the eyes of the lord even worse than all who went before him
 and as if copying the evil ways of jeroboam the son of nebat was a small thing for him he took as his wife jezebel daughter of ethbaal king of zidon and became a servant and worshipper of baal
 and he put up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had made in samaria
 and ahab made an image of asherah and did more than all the kings of israel before him to make the lord the god of israel angry
 in his days hiel made jericho he put its base in position at the price of abiram his oldest son and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son segub even as the lord had said by joshua the son of nun
 and elijah the tishbite of tishbe in gilead said to ahab by the living lord the god of israel whose servant i am there will be no dew or rain in these years but only at my word
 then the word of the lord came to him saying
 go from here in the direction of the east and keep yourself in a secret place by the stream cherith east of jordan
 the water of the stream will be your drink and by my orders the ravens will give you food there
 so he went and did as the lord said living by the stream cherith east of jordan
 and the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening and the water of the stream was his drink
 now after a time the stream became dry because there was no rain in the land
 then the word of the lord came to him saying
 up  go now to zarephath in zidon and make your living place there i have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food
 so he got up and went to zarephath and when he came to the door of the town he saw a widow woman getting sticks together and crying out to her he said will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink
 and when she was going to get it he said to her and get me with it a small bit of bread
 then she said by the life of the lord your god i have nothing but a little meal in my store and a drop of oil in the bottle and now i am getting two sticks together so that i may go in and make it ready for me and my son so that we may have a meal before our death
 and elijah said to her have no fear go and do as you have said but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me and then make something for yourself and your son
 for this is the word of the lord the god of israel the store of meal will not come to an end and the bottle will never be without oil till the day when the lord sends rain on the earth
 so she went and did as elijah said and she and he and her family had food for a long time
 the store of meal did not come to an end and the bottle was never without oil as the lord had said by the mouth of elijah
 now after this the son of the woman of the house became ill so ill that there was no breath in him
 and she said to elijah what have i to do with you o man of god have you come to put god in mind of my sin and to put my son to death
 and he said to her give your son to me and lifting him out of her arms he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed
 and crying to the lord he said o lord my god have you sent evil even on the widow whose guest i am by causing her sons death
 and stretching herself out on the child three times he made his prayer to the lord saying o lord my god be pleased to let this childs life come back to him again
 and the lord gave ear to the voice of elijah and the childs spirit came into him again and he came back to life
 and elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her see your son is living
 then the woman said to elijah now i am certain that you are a man of god and that the word of the lord in your mouth is true
 now after a long time the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go and let ahab see you so that i may send rain on the earth
