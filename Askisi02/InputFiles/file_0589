 but a mist went up from the earth watering all the face of the land
 and the lord god made man from the dust of the earth breathing into him the breath of life and man became a living soul
 and the lord god made a garden in the east in eden and there he put the man whom he had made
 and out of the earth the lord made every tree to come delighting the eye and good for food and in the middle of the garden the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
 and a river went out of eden giving water to the garden and from there it was parted and became four streams
 the name of the first is pishon which goes round about all the land of havilah where there is gold
 and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
 and the name of the second river is gihon this river goes round all the land of cush
 and the name of the third river is tigris which goes to the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
 and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to do work in it and take care of it
 and the lord god gave the man orders saying you may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden
 but of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take for on the day when you take of it death will certainly come to you
 and the lord god said it is not good for the man to be by himself i will make one like himself as a help to him
 and from the earth the lord god made every beast of the field and every bird of the air and took them to the man to see what names he would give them and whatever name he gave to any living thing that was its name
 and the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field but adam had no one like himself as a help
 and the lord god sent a deep sleep on the man and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping joining up the flesh again in its place
 and the bone which the lord god had taken from the man he made into a woman and took her to the man
 and the man said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh let her name be woman because she was taken out of man
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they will be one flesh
 and the man and his wife were without clothing and they had no sense of shame
 and abraham went on his way from there to the land of the south and was living between kadesh and shur in gerar
 and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
 but god came to abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a mans wife
 now abimelech had not come near her and he said lord will you put to death an upright nation
 did he not say to me himself she is my sister and she herself said he is my brother with an upright heart and clean hands have i done this
 and god said to him in the dream i see that you have done this with an upright heart and i have kept you from sinning against me for this reason i did not let you come near her
 so now give the man back his wife for he is a prophet and let him say a prayer for you so your life may be safe but if you do not give her back be certain that death will come to you and all your house
 so abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things and they were full of fear
 then abimelech sent for abraham and said what have you done to us what wrong have i done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin you have done to me things which are not to be done
 and abimelech said to abraham why did you do this thing
