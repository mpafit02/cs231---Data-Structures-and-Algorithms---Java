 for my clean and upright ways keep me safe because my hope is in you
 give israel salvation o god out of all his troubles
 &ltof david&gt o lord be my judge for my behaviour has been upright i have put my faith in the lord i am not in danger of slipping
 put me in the scales o lord so that i may be tested let the fire make clean my thoughts and my heart
 for your mercy is before my eyes and i have gone in the way of your good faith
 i have not taken my seat with foolish persons and i do not go with false men
 i have been a hater of the band of wrongdoers and i will not be seated among sinners
 i will make my hands clean from sin so will i go round your altar o lord
 that i may give out the voice of praise and make public all the wonders which you have done
 lord your house has been dear to me and the resting place of your glory
 let not my soul be numbered among sinners or my life among men of blood
 in whose hands are evil designs and whose right hands take money for judging falsely
 but as for me i will go on in my upright ways be my saviour and have mercy on me
 i have a safe resting place for my feet i will give praise to the lord in the meetings of the people
 &ltof david&gt the lord is my light and my salvation who is then a cause of fear to me the lord is the strength of my life who is a danger to me
 when evil doers even my haters came on me to put an end to me they were broken and put to shame
 even if an army came against me with its tents my heart would have no fear if war was made on me my faith would not be moved
 one prayer have i made to the lord and this is my hearts desire that i may have a place in the house of the lord all the days of my life looking on his glory and getting wisdom in his temple
 for in the time of trouble he will keep me safe in his tent in the secret place of his tent he will keep me from mens eyes high on a rock he will put me
 and now my head will be lifted up higher than my haters who are round me because of this i will make offerings of joy in his tent i will make a song truly i will make a song of praise to the lord
 o lord let the voice of my cry come to your ears have mercy on me and give me an answer
 when you said make search for my face my heart said to you for your face will i make my search
 let not your face be covered from me do not put away your servant in wrath you have been my help do not give me up or take your support from me o god of my salvation
 when my father and my mother are turned away from me then the lord will be my support
 make your way clear to me o lord guiding me by the right way because of my haters
 do not give me into their hands because false witnesses have come out against me and men breathing destruction
 i had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessing of the lord in the land of the living
 let your hope be in the lord take heart and be strong yes let your hope be in the lord
 &ltof david&gt my cry goes up to you o lord my rock do not keep back your answer from me so that i may not become like those who go down into the underworld
 give ear to the voice of my prayer when i am crying to you when my hands are lifted up to your holy place
