 unequal weights are disgusting to the lord and false scales are not good
 a mans steps are of the lord how then may a man have knowledge of his way
 it is a danger to a man to say without thought it is holy and after taking his oaths to be questioning if it is necessary to keep them
 a wise king puts evil doers to flight and makes their evil doing come back on them
 the lord keeps watch over the spirit of man searching all the deepest parts of the body
 mercy and good faith keep the king safe and the seat of his power is based on upright acts
 the glory of young men is their strength and the honour of old men is their grey hairs
 by the wounds of the rod evil is taken away and blows make clean the deepest parts of the body
 the kings heart in the hands of the lord is like the water streams and by him it is turned in any direction at his pleasure
 every way of a man seems right to himself but the lord is the tester of hearts
 to do what is right and true is more pleasing to the lord than an offering
 a high look and a heart of pride *** of the evil doer is sin
 the purposes of the man of industry have their outcome only in wealth but one who is over quick in acting will only come to be in need
 he who gets stores of wealth by a false tongue is going after what is only breath and searching for death
 by their violent acts the evil doers will be pulled away because they have no desire to do what is right
 twisted is the way of him who is full of crime but as for him whose heart is clean his work is upright
 it is better to be living in an angle of the house top than with a bitter tongued woman in a wide house
 the desire of the evil doer is fixed on evil he has no kind feeling for his neighbour
 when the man of pride undergoes punishment the simple man gets wisdom and by watching the wise he gets knowledge
 the upright one looking on the house of the evil doer lets sinners be overturned to their destruction
 he whose ears are stopped at the cry of the poor will himself get no answer to his cry for help
 by a secret offering wrath is turned away and the heat of angry feelings by money in the folds of the robe
 it is a joy to the good man to do right but it is destruction to the workers of evil
 the wanderer from the way of knowledge will have his resting place among the shades
 the lover of pleasure will be a poor man the lover of wine and oil will not get wealth
 the evil doer will be given as a price for the life of the good man and the worker of deceit in the place of the upright
 it is better to be living in a waste land than with a bitter tongued and angry woman
 there is a store of great value in the house of the wise but it is wasted by the foolish man
 he who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life righteousness and honour
 a wise man goes up into the town of the strong ones and overcomes its strength in which they put their faith
