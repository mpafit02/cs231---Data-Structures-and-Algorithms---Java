 for who has had a poor opinion of the day of small things for they will be glad when they see the weighted measuring line in the hand of zerubbabel then he said in answer to me these seven lights are the eyes of the lord which go quickly up and down through all the earth
 and i made answer and said to him what are these two olive trees on the right side of the light support and on the left
 and answering a second time i said to him what are these two olive branches through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out
 and he said in answer to me have you no knowledge what these are and i said no my lord
 and he said these are the two sons of oil whose place is by the lord of all the earth
 then again lifting up my eyes i saw a roll in flight through the air
 and he said to me what do you see and i said a roll going through the air it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide
 then he said to me this is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land for long enough has every thief gone without punishment and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment
 and i will send it out says the lord of armies and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name and it will be in his house causing its complete destruction with its woodwork and its stones
 and the angel who was talking to me went out and said to me let your eyes be lifted up now and see the ephah which is going out
 and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah which is going out and he said further this is their evil doing in all the land
 and i saw a round cover of lead lifted up and a woman was seated in the middle of the ephah
 and he said this is sin and pushing her down into the ephah he put the weight of lead on the mouth of it
 and lifting up my eyes i saw two women coming out and the wind was in their wings and they had wings like the wings of a stork and they took the ephah lifting it up between earth and heaven
 and i said to the angel who was talking to me where are they taking the ephah
 and he said to me to make a house for her in the land of shinar and they will make a place ready and put her there in the place which is hers
 and again lifting up my eyes i saw four war carriages coming out from between the two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass
 in the first war carriage were red horses and in the second black horses
 and in the third white horses and in the fourth horses of mixed colour
 and i made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me what are these my lord
 and the angel answering said to me these go out to the four winds of heaven from their place before the lord of all the earth
 the carriage in which are the black horses goes in the direction of the north country the white go to the west and those of mixed colour go in the direction of the south country
 and the red ones go to the east and they made request that they might go up and down through the earth and he said go up and down through the earth so they went up and down through the earth
 then crying out to me he said see those who are going to the north country have given rest to the spirit of the lord in the north country
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 take the offerings of those who went away as prisoners from heldai tobijah and jedaiah and from the family of josiah the son of zephaniah who have come from babylon
 and take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on the head of zerubbabel
 and say to him these are the words of the lord of armies see the man whose name is the branch under whom there will be fertile growth
 and he will be the builder of the temple of the lord and the glory will be his and he will take his place as ruler on the seat of power and joshua will be a priest at his right hand and between them there will be a design of peace
 and the crown will be for grace to heldai and tobijah and jedaiah and the son of zephaniah to keep their memory living in the house of the lord
