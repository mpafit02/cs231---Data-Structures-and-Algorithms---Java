 that is to say that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me
 you may be certain my brothers that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you  but till now i was kept from it  so that i might have some fruit from you in the same way as i have had it from the other nations
 i have a debt to greeks and to the nations outside to the wise and to those who have no learning
 for which reason i have the desire as far as i am able to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in rome
 for i have no feeling of shame about the good news because it is the power of god giving salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and then to the greek
 for in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of god from faith to faith as it is said in the holy writings the man who does righteousness will be living by his faith
 for there is a revelation of the wrath of god from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing
 because the knowledge of god may be seen in them god having made it clear to them
 for from the first making of the world those things of god which the eye is unable to see that is his eternal power and existence are fully made clear he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made so that men have no reason for wrongdoing
 because having the knowledge of god they did not give glory to god as god and did not give praise but their minds were full of foolish things and their hearts being without sense were made dark
 seeming to be wise they were in fact foolish
 and by them the glory of the eternal god was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth
 for this reason god gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts working shame in their bodies with one another
 because by them the true word of god was changed into that which is false and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made and not to him who made it to whom be blessing for ever so be it
 for this reason god gave them up to evil passions and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural
 and in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another men doing shame with men and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil doing
 and because they had not the mind to keep god in their knowledge god gave them up to an evil mind to do those things which are not right
 being full of all wrongdoing evil desire for the goods of others hate envy putting to death fighting deceit cruel ways evil talk and false statements about others
 hated by god full of pride without respect full of loud talk given to evil inventions not honouring father or mother
 without knowledge not true to their undertakings unkind having no mercy
 who though they have knowledge of the law of god that the fate of those who do these things is death not only go on doing these things themselves but give approval to those who do them
 brothers my hearts desire and my prayer to god for them is that they may get salvation
 for i give witness of them that they have a strong desire for god but not with knowledge
 because not having knowledge of gods righteousness and desiring to give effect to their righteousness they have not put themselves under the righteousness of god
 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith
 for moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it
 but the righteousness which is of faith says these words say not in your heart who will go up to heaven  that is to make christ come down 
 or who will go down into the deep  that is to make christ come again from the dead 
 but what does it say the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith of which we are the preachers
 because if you say with your mouth that jesus is lord and have faith in your heart that god has made him come back from the dead you will have salvation
