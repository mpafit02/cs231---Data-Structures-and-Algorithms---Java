 and i will let the fate of judah and of israel be changed building them up as at first
 and i will make them clean from all their sin with which they have been sinning against me i will have forgiveness for all their sins with which they have been sinning against me and with which they have done evil against me
 and this town will be to me for a name of joy for a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who hearing of all the good which i am doing for them will be shaking with fear because of all the good and the peace which i am doing for it
 this is what the lord has said there will again be sounding in this place of which you say it is a waste without man and without beast even in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled without man and without beast
 happy sounds the voice of joy the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride the voices of those who say give praise to the lord of armies for the lord is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever the voices of those who go with praise into the house of the lord for i will let the land come back to its first condition says the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said again there will be in this place which is a waste without man and without beast and in all its towns a resting place where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest
 in the towns of the hill country in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the country round jerusalem and in the towns of judah the flocks will again go under the hand of him who is numbering them says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will give effect to the good word which i have said about the people of israel and the people of judah
 in those days and at that time i will let a branch of righteousness come up for david and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land
 in those days judah will have salvation and jerusalem will be safe and this is the name which will be given to her the lord is our righteousness
 for the lord has said david will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of israel
 and the priests and the levites will never be without a man to come before me offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 the lord has said if it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times
 then my agreement with my servant david may be broken so that he no longer has a son to take his place on the seat of the kingdom and my agreement with the levites the priests my servants
 as it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered or the sand of the sea measured so will i make the seed of my servant david and the levites my servants
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 have you taken note of what these people have said the two families which the lord took for himself he has given up this they say looking down on my people as being in their eyes no longer a nation
 the lord has said if i have not made day and night and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me
 then i will give up caring for the seed of jacob and of david my servant so that i will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth which were under his rule and all the peoples were fighting against jerusalem and all its towns saying
 the lord the god of israel has said go and say to zedekiah king of judah this is what the lord has said see i will give this town into the hands of the king of babylon and he will have it burned with fire
 and you will not get away from him but will certainly be taken and given up into his hands and you will see the king of babylon eye to eye and he will have talk with you mouth to mouth and you will go to babylon
 but give ear to the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah this is what the lord has said about you death will not come to you by the sword
 you will come to your end in peace and such burnings as they made for your fathers the earlier kings before you will be made for you and they will be weeping for you and saying ah lord  for i have said the word says the lord
 then jeremiah the prophet said all these things to zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem
 when the army of the king of babylon was fighting against jerusalem and against all the towns of judah which had not been taken against lachish and against azekah for these were the last of the walled towns of judah
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord after king zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in jerusalem to give news in public that servants were to be made free
 that every man was to let his hebrew man servant and his hebrew servant girl go free so that no one might make use of a jew his countryman as a servant
 and this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement and every one let his man servant and his servant girl go free not to be used as servants any longer they did so and let them go
