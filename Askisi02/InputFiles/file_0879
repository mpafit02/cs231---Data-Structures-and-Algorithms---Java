 then moses sent men from kadesh to the king of edom to say to him your brother israel says you have knowledge of all the things we have been through
 how our fathers went down into egypt and we were living in egypt for a long time and the egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers
 and the lord gave ear to the voice of our cry and sent an angel and took us out of egypt and now we are in kadesh a town on the edge of your land
 let us now go through your land we will not go into field or vine garden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway not turning to the right or to the left till we have gone past the limits of your land
 and edom said you are not to go through my land for if you do i will come out against you with the sword
 and the children of israel said to him we will go up by the highway and if we or our cattle take of your water we will give you a price for it only let us go through on our feet nothing more
 but he said you are not to go through and edom came out against them in his strength with a great army
 so edom would not let israel go through his land and israel went in another direction
 and they went on from kadesh and came with all their people to mount hor
 and at mount hor at the edge of the land of edom the lord said to moses and aaron
 aaron will be put to rest with his people he will not go into the land which i have given to the children of israel because you went against my word at the waters of meribah
 so take aaron and eleazar his son up into mount hor
 and take aarons robes off him and put them on eleazar his son and death will come to aaron there and he will be put to rest with his people
 so moses did as the lord had said and before the eyes of all the people they went up mount hor
 and moses took off aarons robes and put them on eleazar his son and there on the top of the mountain death came to aaron then moses and eleazar came down from the mountain
 and when the people saw that aaron was dead all the children of israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days
 and it came to the ears of the canaanite the king of arad living in the south that israel was coming by the way of atharim and he came out against them and took some of them prisoners
 then israel made an oath to the lord and said if you will give up this people into my hands then i will send complete destruction on all their towns
 and the lord in answer to the voice of israel gave the canaanites up to them and they put them and their towns completely to destruction and that place was named hormah
 then they went on from mount hor by the way to the red sea going round the land of edom and the spirit of the people was overcome with weariness on the way
 and crying out against god and against moses they said why have you taken us out of egypt to come to our death in the waste land for there is no bread and no water and this poor bread is disgusting to us
 then the lord sent poison snakes among the people and their bites were a cause of death to numbers of the people of israel
 then the people came to moses and said we have done wrong in crying out against the lord and against you make prayer to the lord to take away the snakes from us so moses made prayer for the people
 and the lord said to moses make an image of a snake and put it on a rod and anyone who has been wounded by the snakes looking on it will be made well
 so moses made a snake of brass and put it on a rod and anyone who had a snakebite after looking on the snake of brass was made well
 then the children of israel went on and put up their tents in oboth
 and journeying on again from oboth they put up their tents in iye abarim in the waste land before moab looking east
 and moving on from there they put up their tents in the valley of zered
 from there they went on and put up their tents on the other side of the arnon which is on the waste land at the edge of the land of the amorites for the arnon is the line of division between moab and the amorites
 as it says in the book of the wars of the lord vaheb in suphah and the valley of the amon
