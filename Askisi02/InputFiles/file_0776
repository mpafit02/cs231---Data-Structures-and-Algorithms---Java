 the land of tappuah was the property of manasseh but tappuah on the edge of manasseh was the property of the children of ephraim
 and the limit goes down to the stream kanah to the south of the stream these towns were ephraims among the towns of manasseh manassehs limit was on the north side of the stream ending at the sea
 to the south it is ephraims and to the north it is manassehs and the sea is his limit and they are touching asher on the north and issachar on the east
 in issachar and asher manasseh had beth shean and its daughter towns and ibleam and its daughter towns and the people of dor and its daughter towns and the people of en dor and its daughter towns and the people of taanach and its daughter towns and the people of megiddo and its daughter towns that is the three hills
 but the children of manasseh were not able to make the people of those towns go out but the canaanites would go on living in that land
 and when the children of israel had become strong they put the canaanites to forced work in place of driving them out
 then the children of joseph said to joshua why have you given me only one part and one stretch of land for my heritage for through the blessing given to me by the lord up to now i am a great people
 then joshua said to them if you are such a great people go up into the woodlands clearing a place there for yourselves in the land of the perizzites and the rephaim if the hill country of ephraim is not wide enough for you
 and the children of joseph said the hill country is not enough for us and all the canaanites living in the valley have iron war carriages those in beth shean and its towns as well as those in the valley of jezreel
 then joshua said to the children of joseph to ephraim and manasseh you are a great people and have great power you are not to have one property only
 for the hill country of gilead will be yours  the woodland and cut down  its outskirts will be yours  get the canaanites out for they have iron war carriages  strong
 and all the meeting of the children of israel came together at shiloh and put up the tent of meeting there and the land was crushed before them
 but there were still seven tribes among the children of israel who had not taken up their heritage
 then joshua said to the children of israel why are you so slow to go in and take up your heritage in the land which the lord the god of your fathers has given you
 take from among you three men from every tribe and i will send them to go through the land and make a record of it for distribution as their heritage then let them come back to me
 and let them make division of it into seven parts let judah keep inside his limit on the south and let the children of joseph keep inside their limit on the north
 and you are to have the land marked out in seven parts and come back to me with the record and i will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the lord our god
 for the levites have no part among you to be the lords priests is their heritage and gad and reuben and the half tribe of manasseh have had their heritage on the east side of jordan given to them by moses the servant of the lord
 so the men got up and went and joshua gave orders to those who went to make a record of the land saying go up and down through the land and make a record of it and come back here to me and i will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the lord in shiloh
 so the men went travelling through the land and made a record of it by towns in seven parts in a book and came back to joshua to the tent circle at shiloh
 and joshua made the distribution for them in shiloh by the decision of the lord marking out the land for the children of israel by their divisions
 and the first heritage came out for the tribe of benjamin by their families and the limit of their heritage went between the children of judah and the children of joseph
 and their limit on the north was from the jordan and the line goes up to the side of jericho on the north and through the hill country to the west ending at the waste land of beth aven
 and from there the line goes south to luz to the side of luz  which is beth el  then down to ataroth addar by the mountain to the south of beth horon the lower
