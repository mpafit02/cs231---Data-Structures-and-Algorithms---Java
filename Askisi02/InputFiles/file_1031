 and the angel who was talking to me went out and another angel went out and meeting him
 said to him go quickly and say to this young man jerusalem will be an unwalled town because of the great number of men and cattle in her
 for i says the lord will be a wall of fire round about her and i will be the glory inside her
 ho ho  go in flight from the land of the north says the lord for i have sent you far and wide to the four winds of heaven says the lord
 ho  zion go in flight from danger you who are living with the daughter of babylon
 for this is what the lord of armies has said in the way of glory he has sent me to the nations which have taken your goods for anyone touching you is touching what is most dear to him
 for at the shaking of my hand over them their goods will be taken by those who were their servants and you will see that the lord of armies has sent me
 give songs of joy o daughter of zion for i come and i will make my resting place among you says the lord
 and a number of nations will be joined to the lord in that day and will become my people and i will be living among you and you will see that the lord of armies has sent me to you
 and judah will be the lords heritage in the holy land and jerusalem will again be his
 let all flesh be quiet and make no sound before the lord for he is awake and has come from his holy resting place
 and he let me see joshua the high priest in his place before the angel of the lord and the satan at his right hand ready to take up a cause against him
 and the lord said to the satan may the lords word be sharp against you o satan the word of the lord who has taken jerusalem for himself is this not a burning branch pulled out of the fire
 now joshua was clothed in unclean robes and he was in his place before the angel
 and he made answer and said to those who were there before him take the unclean robes off him and let him be clothed in clean robes
 and let them put a clean head dress on his head so they put a clean head dress on his head clothing him with clean robes and to him he said see i have taken your sin away from you
 and the angel of the lord made a statement to joshua and said
 these are the words of the lord of armies if you will go in my ways and keep what i have put in your care then you will be judge over my temple and have the care of my house and i will give you the right to come in among those who are there
 give ear now o joshua the high priest you and your friends who are seated before you for these are men who are a sign for see i will let my servant the branch be seen
 for see the stone which i have put before joshua on one stone are seven eyes see the design cut on it will be my work says the lord of armies and i will take away the sin of that land in one day
 in that day says the lord of armies you will be one anothers guests under the vine and under the fig tree
 and the angel who was talking to me came again awaking me as a man out of his sleep
 and he said to me what do you see and i said i see a light support made all of gold with its cup on the top of it and seven lights on it and there are seven pipes to every one of the lights which are on the top of it
 and two olive trees by it one on the right side of the cup and one on the left
 and i made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me what are these my lord
 then the angel who was talking to me answering me said have you no knowledge of what these are and i said no my lord
 this is the word of the lord to zerubbabel saying not by force or by power but by my spirit says the lord of armies
 who are you o great mountain before zerubbabel you will become level and he will let all see the headstone with cries of grace grace to it
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 the hands of zerubbabel have put the base of this house in place and his hands will make it complete and it will be clear to you that the lord of armies has sent me to you
