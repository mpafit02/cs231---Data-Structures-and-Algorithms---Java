 what will come on us if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the lord and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came
 and god was a witness with them by signs and wonders and by more than natural powers and by his distribution of the holy spirit at his pleasure
 for he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come of which i am writing
 but a certain writer has given his witness saying what is man that you keep him in mind what is the son of man that you take him into account
 you made him a little lower than the angels you gave him a crown of glory and honour and made him ruler over all the works of your hands
 you put all things under his feet for in making man the ruler over all things god did not put anything outside his authority though we do not see everything under him now
 but we see him who was made a little lower than the angels even jesus crowned with glory and honour because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of god he might undergo death for all men
 because it was right for him for whom and through whom all things have being in guiding his sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain
 for he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers
 saying i will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers i will make a song of praise to you before the church
 and again he says i will put my faith in him and again see i am here and the children which god has given to me
 and because the children are flesh and blood he took a body himself and became like them so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death that is to say the evil one
 and let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death go free
 for truly he does not take on the life of angels but that of the seed of abraham
 because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with god making offerings for the sins of the people
 for having been put to the test himself he is able to give help to others when they are tested
 for this reason holy brothers marked out to have a part in heaven give thought to jesus the representative and high priest of our faith
 who kept faith with god who gave him his place even as moses did in all his house
 and it was right for this man to have more honour than moses even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house
 for every house has a builder but the builder of all things is god
 and moses certainly kept faith as a servant in all his house and as a witness of those things which were to be said later
 but christ as a son over his house whose house are we if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end
 and so as the holy spirit says today if you let his voice come to your ears
 be not hard of heart as when you made me angry on the day of testing in the waste land
 when your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years
 so that i was angry with this generation and i said their hearts are in error at all times and they have no knowledge of my ways
 and being angry i made an oath saying they may not come into my rest
 my brothers take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief turning away from the living god
 but give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still today so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin
 for if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start even till the end we have a part with christ
