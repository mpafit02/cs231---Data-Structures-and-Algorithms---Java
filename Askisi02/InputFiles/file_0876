 all the best of the oil and the wine and the grain the first fruits of them which they give to the lord to you have i given them
 the earliest produce from their land which they take to the lord is to be yours everyone in your house who is clean may have it for his food
 everything given by oath to the lord in israel is to be yours
 the first birth of every living thing which is offered to the lord of man or beast is to be yours but for the first sons of man payment is to be made and for the first young of unclean beasts
 payment is to be made for these when they are a month old at the value fixed by you a price of five shekels by the scale of the holy place that is twenty gerahs to the shekel
 but no such payment may be made for the first birth of an ox or a sheep or a goat these are holy their blood is to be dropped on the altar and their fat burned for an offering made by fire a sweet smell to the lord
 their flesh is to be yours like the breast of the wave offering and the right leg it is to be yours
 all the lifted offerings of the holy things which the children of israel give to the lord i have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as a right for ever this is an agreement made with salt before the lord to you and to your seed for ever
 and the lord said to aaron you will have no heritage in their land or any part among them i am your part and your heritage among the children of israel
 and to the children of levi i have given as their heritage all the tenths offered in israel as payment for the work they do the work of the tent of meeting
 in future the children of israel are not to come near the tent of meeting so that death may not come to them because of sin
 but the levites are to do the work of the tent of meeting and be responsible for errors in connection with it this is a law for ever through all your generations and among the children of israel they will have no heritage
 for the tenths which the children of israel give as a lifted offering to the lord i have given to the levites as their heritage and so i have said to them among the children of israel they will have no heritage
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the levites when you take from the children of israel the tenth which i have given to you from them as your heritage a tenth part of that tenth is to be offered as an offering lifted up before the lord
 and this lifted offering is to be put to your credit as if it was grain from the grain floor and wine from the vines
 so you are to make an offering lifted up to the lord from all the tenths which you get from the children of israel giving out of it the lords lifted offering to aaron the priest
 from everything given to you let the best of it the holy part of it be offered as a lifted offering to the lord
 say to them then when the best of it is lifted up on high it is to be put to the account of the levites as the increase of the grain floor and of the place where the grapes are crushed
 it is to be your food for you and your families in every place it is your reward for your work in the tent of meeting
 and no sin will be yours on account of it when the best of it has been lifted up on high you are not to make a wrong use of the holy things of the children of israel so that death may not overtake you
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 this is the rule of the law which the lord has made saying give orders to the children of israel to give you a red cow without any mark on her and on which the yoke has never been put
 give her to eleazar the priest and let him take her outside the tent circle and have her put to death before him
 then let eleazar the priest take some of her blood on his finger shaking the blood seven times in the direction of the front of the tent of meeting
 and the cow is to be burned before him her skin and her flesh and her blood and her waste are to be burned
 then let the priest take cedar wood and hyssop and red thread and put them into the fire where the cow is burning
 and the priest after washing his clothing and bathing his body in water may come back to the tent circle and will be unclean till evening
 and he who does the burning is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening
 then let a man who is clean take the dust of the burned cow and put it outside the tent circle in a clean place where it is to be kept for the children of israel and used in making the water which takes away what is unclean it is a sin offering
