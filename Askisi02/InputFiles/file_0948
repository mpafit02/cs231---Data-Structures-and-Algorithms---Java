 with god we will do great things for by him will our haters be crushed underfoot
 &ltto the chief music maker of david a psalm&gt god of my praise let my prayer be answered
 for the mouth of the sinner is open against me in deceit his tongue has said false things against me
 words of hate are round about me they have made war against me without cause
 for my love they give me back hate but i have given myself to prayer
 they have put on me evil for good hate in exchange for my love
 put an evil man over him and let one be placed at his right hand to say evil of him
 when he is judged let the decision go against him and may his prayer become sin
 let his life be short let another take his position of authority
 let his children have no father and his wife be made a widow
 let his children be wanderers looking to others for their food let them be sent away from the company of their friends
 let his creditor take all his goods and let others have the profit of his work
 let no man have pity on him or give help to his children when he is dead
 let his seed be cut off in the coming generation let their name go out of memory
 let the lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness
 let them be ever before the eyes of the lord so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth
 because he had no mercy but was cruel to the low and the poor designing the death of the broken hearted
 as he took pleasure in cursing so let it come on him and as he had no delight in blessing let it be far from him
 he put on cursing like a robe and it has come into his body like water and into his bones like oil
 let it be to him as a robe which he puts on let it be like a band which is round him at all times
 let this be the reward given to my haters from the lord and to those who say evil of my soul
 but o lord god give me your help because of your name take me out of danger because your mercy is good
 for i am poor and in need and my heart is wounded in me
 i am gone like the shade when it is stretched out i am forced out of my place like a locust
 my knees are feeble for need of food there is no fat on my bones
 as for me they make sport of me shaking their heads when they see me
 give me help o lord my god in your mercy be my saviour
 so that they may see that it is the work of your hand that you lord have done it
 they may give curses but you give blessing when they come up against me put them to shame but let your servant be glad
 let my haters be clothed with shame covering themselves with shame as with a robe
