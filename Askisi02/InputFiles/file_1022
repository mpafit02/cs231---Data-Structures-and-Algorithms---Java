 and she said to me let me come into the grain field and take up the grain after the cutters so she came and has been here from morning till now without resting even for a minute
 then said boaz to ruth give ear to me my daughter do not go to take up the grain in another field or go away from here but keep here by my young women
 keep your eyes on the field they are cutting and go after them have i not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you and when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there
 then she went down on her face to the earth and said to him why have i grace in your eyes that you give attention to me seeing i am from a strange people
 and boaz answering said to her i have had news of everything you have done for your mother in law after the death of your husband how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth and came to a people who are strange to you
 the lord give you a reward for what you have done and may a full reward be given to you by the lord the god of israel under whose wings you have come to take cover
 then she said may i have grace in your eyes my lord for you have given me comfort and you have said kind words to your servant though i am not like one of your servants
 and at meal time boaz said to her come here and take some of the bread and put your bit into the wine and she took her seat among the grain cutters and he gave her dry grain and she took it and there was more than enough for her meal
 and when she got ready to take up the grain boaz gave his young men orders saying let her take it even from among the cut grain and say nothing to her
 and let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up and dropped for her to take and let no sharp word be said to her
 so she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain
 and she took it up and went into the town and she let her mother in law see what she had got and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest
 and her mother in law said to her where did you take up the grain today and where were you working may a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you and she gave her mother in law an account of where she had been working and said the name of the man with whom i was working today is boaz
 and naomi said to her daughter in law may the blessing of the lord who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead be on him and naomi said to her the man is of our family one of our near relations
 and ruth the moabitess said truly he said to me keep near my young men till all my grain is cut
 and naomi said to ruth her daughter in law it is better my daughter for you to go out with his servant girls so that no danger may come to you in another field
 so she kept near the servant girls of boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended and she went on living with her mother in law
 and naomi her mother in law said to her my daughter am i not to get you a resting place where you may be in comfort
 and now is there not boaz our relation with whose young women you were see tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grain floor
 so take a bath and after rubbing your body with sweet oil put on your best robe and go down to the grain floor but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal
 but see to it when he goes to rest that you take note of the place where he is sleeping and go in there and uncovering his feet take your place by him and he will say what you are to do
 and she said i will do all you say
 so she went down to the grain floor and did all her mother in law had said to her
 now when boaz had taken meat and drink and his heart was glad he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain then she came softly and uncovering his feet went to rest
 now in the middle of the night the man awaking from his sleep in fear and lifting himself up saw a woman stretched at his feet
 and he said who are you and she answering said i am your servant ruth take your servant as wife for you are a near relation
 and he said may the lord give you his blessing my daughter even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done in not going after young men with or without wealth
 and now my daughter have no fear i will do for you whatever you say for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue
 now it is true that i am a near relation but there is a relation nearer than i
 take your rest here tonight and in the morning if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do very well let him do so but if he will not then by the living lord i myself will do so
