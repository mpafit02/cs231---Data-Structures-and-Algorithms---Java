 and he gave them orders to say these words to esau your servant jacob says till now i have been living with laban
 and i have oxen and asses and flocks and men servants and women servants and i have sent to give my lord news of these things so that i may have grace in his eyes
 when the servants came back they said we have seen your brother esau and he is coming out to you and four hundred men with him
 then jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups
 and said if esau meeting one group makes an attack on them the others will get away safely
 then jacob said o god of my father abraham the god of my father isaac the lord who said to me go back to your country and your family and i will be good to you
 i am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant for with only my stick in my hand i went across jordan and now i have become two armies
 be my saviour from the hand of esau my brother for my fear is that he will make an attack on me putting to death mother and child
 and you said truly i will be good to you and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered
 then he put up his tent there for the night and from among his goods he took as an offering for his brother esau
 two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep
 thirty camels with their young ones forty cows ten oxen twenty asses and ten young asses
 these he gave to his servants every herd by itself and he said to his servants go on before me and let there be a space between one herd and another
 and he gave orders to the first saying when my brother esau comes to you and says whose servant are you and where are you going and whose are these herds
 then say to him these are your servant jacobs they are an offering for my lord for esau and he himself is coming after us
 and he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds saying this is what you are to say to esau when you see him
 and you are to say further jacob your servant is coming after us for he said to himself i will take away his wrath by the offering which i have sent on and then i will come before him it may be that i will have grace in his eyes
 so the servants with the offerings went on in front and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people
 and in the night he got up and taking with him his two wives and the two servant women and his eleven children he went over the river jabbok
 he took them and sent them over the stream with all he had
 then jacob was by himself and a man was fighting with him till dawn
 but when the man saw that he was not able to overcome jacob he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg so that his leg was damaged
 and he said to him let me go now for the dawn is near but jacob said i will not let you go till you have given me your blessing
 then he said what is your name and he said jacob
 and he said your name will no longer be jacob but israel for in your fight with god and with men you have overcome
 then jacob said what is your name and he said what is my name to you then he gave him a blessing
 and jacob gave that place the name of peniel saying i have seen god face to face and still i am living
 and while he was going past peniel the sun came up and he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg
 for this reason the children of israel even today never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food because the hollow of jacobs leg was touched
 then jacob lifting up his eyes saw esau coming with his four hundred men so he made a division of the children between leah and rachel and the two women servants
