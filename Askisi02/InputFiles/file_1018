 a man without sense has no knowledge of this and a foolish man may not take it in
 when the sinners come up like the grass and all the workers of evil do well for themselves it is so that their end may be eternal destruction
 but you o lord are on high for ever
 for see  your haters o lord will be put to death all the workers of evil will be put to flight
 but my horn is lifted up like the horn of the ox the best oil is flowing on my head
 my eyes have seen trouble come on my haters my ears have news of the fate of the evil doers who have come up against me
 the good man will be like a tall tree in his strength his growth will be as the wide stretching trees of lebanon
 those who are planted in the house of the lord will come up tall and strong in his gardens
 they will give fruit even when they are old they will be fertile and full of growth
 for a sign that the lord is upright he is my rock there is no deceit in him
 the lord is king he is clothed with glory the lord is clothed with strength power is the cord of his robe the world is fixed so that it may not be moved
 the seat of your power has been from the past you are eternal
 the rivers send up o lord the rivers send up their voices they send them up with a loud cry
 the lord in heaven is stronger than the noise of great waters yes he is stronger than the great waves of the sea
 your witness is most certain it is right for your house to be holy o lord for ever
 o god in whose hands is punishment o god of punishment let your shining face be seen
 be lifted up o judge of the earth let their reward come to the men of pride
 how long will sinners o lord how long will sinners have joy over us
 words of pride come from their lips all the workers of evil say great things of themselves
 your people are crushed by them o lord your heritage is troubled
 they put to death the widow and the guest they take the lives of children who have no father
 and they say jah will not see it the god of jacob will not give thought to it
 give your mind to my words you who are without wisdom among the people you foolish men when will you be wise
 has he by whom your ears were planted no hearing or is he blind by whom your eyes were formed
 he who is the judge of the nations will he not give men the reward of their acts even he who gives knowledge to man
 the lord has knowledge of the thoughts of man for they are only a breath
 happy is the man who is guided by you o jah and to whom you give teaching out of your law
 so that you may give him rest from the days of evil till a hole is made ready for the destruction of the sinners
 the lord will not give up his people or take away his support from his heritage
 but decisions will again be made in righteousness and they will be kept by all whose hearts are true
