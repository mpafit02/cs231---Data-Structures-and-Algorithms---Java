 those who have evil designs against me come near they are far from your law
 you are near o lord and all your teachings are true
 i have long had knowledge that your unchanging word is for ever
 &ltresh&gt o see my trouble and be my saviour for i keep your law in my mind
 undertake my cause and come to my help give me life as you have said
 salvation is far from evil doers for they have made no search for your rules
 great is the number of your mercies o lord give me life in keeping with your decisions
 great is the number of those who are against me but i have not been turned away from your unchanging word
 i saw with hate those who were untrue to you for they did not keep your saying
 see how great is my love for your orders give me life o lord in keeping with your mercy
 your word is true from the first and your upright decision is unchanging for ever
 &ltshin&gt rulers have been cruel to me without cause but i have the fear of your word in my heart
 i am delighted by your saying like a man who makes discovery of great wealth
 i am full of hate and disgust for false words but i am a lover of your law
 seven times a day do i give you praise because of your upright decisions
 great peace have lovers of your law they have no cause for falling
 lord my hope has been in your salvation and i have kept your teachings
 my soul has kept your unchanging word great is my love for it
 i have been ruled by your orders for all my ways are before you
 &lttau&gt let my cry come before you o lord give me wisdom in keeping with your word
 let my prayer come before you take me out of trouble as you have said
 let my lips be flowing with praise because you have given me knowledge of your rules
 let my tongue make songs in praise of your word for all your teachings are righteousness
 let your hand be near for my help for i have given my heart to your orders
 all my desire has been for your salvation o lord and your law is my delight
 give life to my soul so that it may give you praise and let your decisions be my support
 i have gone out of the way like a wandering sheep make search for your servant for i keep your teachings ever in mind
 &ltfor the chief music maker on the sheminith a psalm of david&gt send help lord for mercy has come to an end there is no more faith among the children of men
 everyone says false words to his neighbour their tongues are smooth in their talk and their hearts are full of deceit
 the smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the lord
