 so if you in using a strange tongue say words which have no sense how will anyone take in what you are saying for you will be talking to the air
 there are it may be a number of different voices in the world and no voice is without sense
 but if the sense of the voice is not clear to me i am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking and he will be the same to me
 so if you are desiring the things which the spirit gives let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church
 for this reason let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may at the same time be able to give the sense
 for if i make use of tongues in my prayers my spirit makes the prayer but not my mind
 what then let my prayer be from the spirit and equally from the mind let my song be from the spirit and equally from mind
 for if you give a blessing with the spirit how will the man who has no knowledge say so be it after your prayer seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying
 for your giving of the blessing is certainly well done but of no profit to the man without knowledge
 i give praise to god that i am able to make use of tongues more than you all
 but in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear so that others might have profit than ten thousand words in a strange tongue
 my brothers do not be children in mind in evil be as little children but in mind be of full growth
 in the law it is said by men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people and not even so will they give ear to me says the lord
 for this reason tongues are for a sign not to those who have faith but to those who have not but the prophets word is for those who have faith and not for the rest who have not
 if then the church has come together and all are using tongues and there come in men without knowledge or faith will they not say that you are unbalanced
 but if all are teaching as prophets and a man without faith or knowledge comes in he is tested by all he is judged by all
 the secrets of his heart are made clear and he will go down on his face and give worship to god saying that god is truly among you
 what is it then my brothers when you come together everyone has a holy song or a revelation or a tongue or is giving the sense of it let everything be done for the common good
 if any man makes use of a tongue let it not be more than two or at the most three and in turn and let someone give the sense
 but if there is no one to give the sense let him keep quiet in the church and let his words be to himself and to god
 and let the prophets give their words but not more than two or three and let the others be judges of what they say
 but if a revelation is given to another who is seated near let the first be quiet
 for you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort
 and the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets
 for god is not a god whose ways are without order but a god of peace as in all the churches of the saints
 let women keep quiet in the churches for it is not right for them to be talking but let them be under control as it says in the law
 and if they have a desire for knowledge about anything let them put questions to their husbands privately for talking in the church puts shame on a woman
 what was it from you that the word of god went out or did it only come in to you
 if any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the spirit let him take note of the things which i am writing to you as being the word of the lord
 but if any man is without knowledge let him be so
