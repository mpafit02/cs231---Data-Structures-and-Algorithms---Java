 mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were door keepers keeping the watch at the store houses of the doors
 these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the ruler and of ezra the priest the scribe
 and when the time came for the wall of jerusalem to be made holy they sent for the levites out of all their places to come to jerusalem to keep the feast with joy and with praise and melody with brass and corded instruments of music
 and the sons of the music makers came together from the lowland round about jerusalem and from the daughter towns of the netophathites
 and from beth gilgal and from the fields of geba and azmaveth for the music makers had made daughter towns for themselves round about jerusalem
 and the priests and the levites made themselves clean and they made the people clean and the doorways and the wall
 then i made the rulers of judah come up on the wall and i put in position two great bands of them who gave praise walking in ordered lines one went to the right on the wall in the direction of the doorway where the waste was put
 and after them went hoshaiah and half of the rulers of judah
 and azariah ezra and meshullam
 judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah
 and certain of the priests sons with wind instruments zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of micaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph
 and his brothers shemaiah and azarel milalai gilalai maai nethanel and judah hanani with the music instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe was at their head
 and by the doorway of the fountain and straight in front of them they went up by the steps of the town of david at the slope up of the wall over the house of david as far as the water doorway to the east
 and the other band of those who gave praise went to the left and i went after them with half the people on the wall over the tower of the ovens as far as the wide wall
 and over the doorway of ephraim and by the old door and the fish door and the tower of hananel and the tower of hammeah as far as the sheep door and at the doorway of the watchmen they came to a stop
 so the two bands of those who gave praise took up their positions in the house of god and i and half of the chiefs with me
 and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin micaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with wind instruments
 and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer and the makers of melody made their voices loud with jezrahiah their overseer
 and on that day they made great offerings and were glad for god had made them glad with great joy and the women and the children were glad with them so that the joy of jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off
 and on that day certain men were put over the rooms where the things which had been given were stored for the lifted offerings and the first fruits and the tenths and to take into them the amounts from the fields of every town fixed by the law for the priests and the levites for judah was glad on account of the priests and the levites who were in their places
 and they kept the watch of their god and were responsible for making things clean and so did the music makers and the door keepers as it was ordered by david and solomon his son
 for in the days of david and asaph in the past there was a master of the music and songs of blessing and praise to god
 and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave what was needed by the music makers and the door keepers day by day and they made the offerings holy for the levites and the levites did the same for the sons of aaron
 on that day there was a reading from the book of moses in the hearing of the people and they saw that it said in the book that no ammonite or moabite might ever come into the meeting of god
 because they did not give the children of israel bread and water when they came to them but got balaam to put a curse on them though the curse was turned into a blessing by our god
 so after hearing the law they took out of israel all the mixed people
 now before this eliashib the priest who had been placed over the rooms of the house of our god being a friend of tobiah
 had made ready for him a great room where at one time they kept the meal offerings the perfume and the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by order to the levites and the music makers and the door keepers and the lifted offerings for the priests
 but all this time i was not at jerusalem for in the thirty second year of artaxerxes king of babylon i went to the king and after some days i got the king to let me go
 and i came to jerusalem and it was clear to me what evil eliashib had done for tobiah in making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of god
