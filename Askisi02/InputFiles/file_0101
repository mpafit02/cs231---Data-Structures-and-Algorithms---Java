 and he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his
 for then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world but now he has come to us at the end of the old order to put away sin by the offering of himself
 and because by gods law death comes to men once and after that they are judged
 so christ having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men will be seen a second time without sin by those who are waiting for him for their salvation
 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the jews living in all parts of the earth
 let it be all joy to you my brothers when you undergo tests of every sort
 because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope
 but let this power have its full effect so that you may be made complete needing nothing
 but if any man among you is without wisdom let him make his request to god who gives freely to all without an unkind word and it will be given to him
 let him make his request in faith doubting nothing for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea which are troubled by the driving of the wind
 let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the lord
 for there is a division in his mind and he is uncertain in all his ways
 but let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up
 but the man of wealth that he is made low because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end
 for when the sun comes up with its burning heat the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways
 there is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing because if he has gods approval he will be given the crown of life which the lord has said he will give to those who have love for him
 let no man say when he is tested i am tested by god for it is not possible for god to be tested by evil and he himself puts no man to such a test
 but every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire
 then when its time comes desire gives birth to sin and sin when it is of full growth gives birth to death
 do not be turned from the right way dear brothers
 every good and true thing is given to us from heaven coming from the father of lights with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning
 of his purpose he gave us being by his true word so that we might be in a sense the first fruits of all the things which he had made
 you have knowledge of this dear brothers but let every man be quick in hearing slow in words slow to get angry
 for the righteousness of god does not come about by the wrath of man
 for this reason putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil take into your souls without pride the word which being planted there is able to give you salvation
 but be doers of the word and not only hearers of it blinding yourselves with false ideas
 because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass
 for after looking at himself he goes away and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like
 but he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect this man will have a blessing on his acts
 if a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false this mans religion is of no value
