 for he takes up the drops from the sea he sends them through his mist as rain
 flowing down from the sky and dropping on the peoples
 and who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out or of the thunders of his tent
 see he is stretching out his mist covering the tops of the mountains with it
 for by these he gives food to the peoples and bread in full measure
 he takes the light in his hands sending it against the mark
 the thunder makes clear his passion and the storm gives news of his wrath
 at this my heart is shaking it is moved out of its place
 give ear to the rolling noise of his voice to the hollow sound which goes out of his mouth
 he sends it out through all the heaven and his thunder flame to the ends of the earth
 after it a voice is sounding thundering out the word of his power he does not keep back his thunder flames from his mouth his voice is sounding
 he does wonders more than may be searched out great things of which we have no knowledge
 for he says to the snow make the earth wet and to the rain storm come down
 he puts an end to the work of every man so that all may see his work
 then the beasts go into their holes and take their rest
 out of its place comes the storm wind and the cold out of its store houses
 by the breath of god ice is made and the wide waters are shut in
 the thick cloud is weighted with thunder flame and the cloud sends out its light
 and it goes this way and that round about turning itself by his guiding to do whatever he gives orders to be done on the face of his world of men
 for a rod or for a curse or for mercy causing it to come on the mark
 give ear to this o job and keep quiet in your place and take note of the wonders worked by god
 have you knowledge of gods ordering of his works how he makes the light of his cloud to be seen
 have you knowledge of the balancings of the clouds the wonders of him who has all wisdom
 you whose clothing is warm when the earth is quiet because of the south wind
 will you with him make the skies smooth and strong as a polished looking glass
 make clear to me what we are to say to him we are unable to put our cause before him because of the dark
 how may he have knowledge of my desire for talk with him or did any man ever say may destruction come on me
 and now the light is not seen for it is dark because of the clouds but a wind comes clearing them away
 a bright light comes out of the north gods glory is greatly to be feared
 there is no searching out of the ruler of all his strength and his judging are great he is full of righteousness doing no wrong
