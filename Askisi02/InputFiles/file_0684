 at the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes the thunder flames for the rain and sends out the wind from his store houses
 then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge every gold worker is put to shame by the image he has made for his metal image is deceit and there is no breath in them
 they are nothing a work of error in the time of their punishment destruction will overtake them
 the heritage of jacob is not like these for the maker of all things is his heritage the lord of armies is his name
 get your goods together and go out of the land o you who are shut up in the walled town
 for the lord has said i will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time troubling them so that they will be conscious of it
 sorrow is mine for i am wounded  my wound may not be made well and i said cruel is my disease i may not be free from it
 my tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken my children have gone from me and they are not no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains
 for the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts not looking to the lord for directions so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight
 news is going about see it is coming a great shaking is coming from the north country so that the towns of judah may be made waste and become the living place of jackals
 o lord i am conscious that a mans way is not in himself man has no power of guiding his steps
 o lord put me right but with wise purpose not in your wrath or you will make me small
 let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you and on the families who give no worship to your name for they have made a meal of jacob truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 give ear to the words of this agreement and say to the men of judah and to the people of jerusalem
 the lord the god of israel has said let that man be cursed who does not give ear to the words of this agreement
 to the order which i gave your fathers on the day when i took them out of the land of egypt out of the oven of iron saying give ear to my voice and do all the orders i have given you so you will be my people and i will be your god
 so that i may give effect to the oath which i made to your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day and i said in answer so be it o lord
 and the lord said to me give out these words in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying give ear to the words of this agreement and do them
 for i gave certain witness to your fathers on the day when i took them up out of the land of egypt and even to this day getting up early and witnessing and saying give ear to my voice
 but they gave no attention and did not give ear but they went on every man in the pride of his evil heart so i sent on them all the curses in this agreement which i gave them orders to keep but they did not
 and the lord said to me there is an evil design at work among the men of judah and the people of jerusalem
 they are turned back to the sins of their fathers who would not give ear to my words they have gone after other gods and become their servants the people of israel and the people of judah have not kept the agreement which i made with their fathers
 so the lord has said i will send evil on them which they will not be able to get away from and they will send up a cry for help to me but i will not give ear to them
 then the towns of judah and the people of jerusalem will go crying for help to the gods to whom they have been burning perfumes but they will give them no salvation in the time of their trouble
 for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns o judah and for every street in jerusalem you have put up altars to the baal for burning perfumes to the baal
 and as for you make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them for i will not give ear to their cry in the time of their trouble
 about judah what have you to do in my house is it your thought that oaths and holy flesh will get you out of your trouble will you make yourself safe in this way
 you had been named by the lord a branching olive tree fair with beautiful fruit with the noise of a great rushing he has put it on fire and its branches are broken
 for the lord of armies by whom you were planted has given his decision for evil against you because of the evil which the people of israel and the people of judah have done in moving me to wrath by offering perfumes to the baal
