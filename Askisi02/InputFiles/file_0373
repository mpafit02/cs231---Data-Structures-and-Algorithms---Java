 so that the words of the lord which he said by the mouth of jeremiah might come true till the land had had pleasure in her sabbaths for as long as she was waste the land kept the sabbath till seventy years were complete
 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order that the words which the lord had said by the mouth of jeremiah might come true the spirit of cyrus king of persia was moved by the lord and he made a public statement and had it given out through all his kingdom and put in writing saying
 cyrus king of persia has said all the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the lord the god of heaven and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in jerusalem which is in judah whoever there is among you of all his people may the lord his god be with him and let him go up
 then he made a brass altar twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high
 and he made the great water vessel of metal round in form measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round
 and under it was a design of flowers all round it ten to a cubit circling the water vessel in two lines they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the water vessel
 it was supported on twelve oxen three facing to the north three to the west three to the south and three to the east the water vessel resting on top of them their back parts were all turned to the middle of it
 it was as thick as a mans open hand and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup like a lily flower it would take three thousand baths
 and he made ten washing vessels putting five on the right side and five on the left such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them but the great water vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves
 and he made the ten gold supports for the lights as directions had been given for them and he put them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left
 he made ten tables and put them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made a hundred gold basins
 then he made the open space for the priests and the great open space and its doors plating the doors with brass
 he put the great water vessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
 and huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins so he came to the end of all the work he did for king solomon in the house of god
 the two pillars and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
 and the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
 and he made the ten bases and the ten washing vessels which were on the bases
 the great water vessel with the twelve oxen under it
 all the pots and the spades and the meat hooks and their vessels which huram who was as his father made for king solomon for the house of the lord were of polished brass
 the king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of jordan in the soft earth between succoth and zeredah
 so solomon made all these vessels a very great store of them and the weight of the brass used was not measured
 and solomon made all the vessels used in the house of god the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed
 and the supports for the lights with their lights to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room of the best gold
