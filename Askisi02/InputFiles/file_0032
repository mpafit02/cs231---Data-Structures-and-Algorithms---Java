 but god is my witness that it was in pity for you that i did not come to corinth at that time
 not that we have authority over your faith but we are helpers of your joy for it is faith which is your support
 now i paul myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of christ i who am poor in spirit when with you but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when i am away from you
 yes i make my request to you so that when i am with you i may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh
 for though we may be living in the flesh we are not fighting after the way of the flesh
  for the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh but are strong before god for the destruction of high places 
 putting an end to reasonings and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of god and causing every thought to come under the authority of christ
 being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control
 give attention to the things which are before you if any man seems to himself to be christs let him keep in mind that we are as much christs as he is
 for though i might take pride in our authority  which the lord gave for building you up and not for your destruction  it will not be a cause of shame to me
 that i may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters
 for his letters they say have weight and are strong but in body he is feeble and his way of talking has little force
 let those who say this keep in mind that what we are in word by letters when we are away so will we be in act when we are present
 for we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves but these measuring themselves by themselves and making comparison of themselves with themselves are not wise
 we will not give glory to ourselves in over great measure but after the measure of the rule which god has given us a measure which comes even to you
 for we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are as if our authority did not come as far as to you for we came even as far as you with the good news of christ
 not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business that is for the work of others but having hope that with the growth of your faith we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work
 so that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are and not take credit for another mans work in making things ready to our hand
 but whoever has a desire for glory let his glory be in the lord
 for the lords approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself but on the lords opinion of him
 put up with me if i am a little foolish but truly you do put up with me
 for i have a very great care for you because you have been married by me to one husband and it is my desire to give you completely holy to christ
 but i have a fear that in some way as eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for christ
 for if anyone comes preaching another jesus from the one whose preachers we are or if you have got a different spirit or a different sort of good news from those which came to you how well you put up with these things
 for in my opinion i am in no way less than the most important of the apostles
 but though i am rough in my way of talking i am not so in knowledge as we have made clear to all by our acts among you
 or did i do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up because i gave you the good news of god without reward
 i took money from other churches as payment for my work so that i might be your servant
 and when i was present with you and was in need i let no man be responsible for me for the brothers when they came from macedonia gave me whatever was needed and in everything i kept myself from being a trouble to you and i will go on doing so
 as the true word of christ is in me i will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of achaia
