 and so we have sent judas and silas who will say the same things to you themselves by word of mouth
 for it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to put on you nothing more than these necessary things
 to keep from things offered to false gods and from blood and from things put to death in ways which are against the law and from the evil desires of the body if you keep yourselves from these you will do well may you be happy
 so they being sent away came down to antioch and having got the people together they gave them the letter
 and after reading it they were glad of its comfort
 and judas and silas who themselves were prophets gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith
 and when they had been there for some time they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them
   
 but paul and barnabas kept on in antioch teaching and preaching the word of god with a number of others
 and after some days paul said to barnabas let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of god and see how they are
 and barnabas had a desire to take with them john named mark
 but paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in pamphylia and had not gone on with the work
 and there was a sharp argument between them so that they were parted from one another and barnabas took mark with him and went by ship to cyprus
 but paul took silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers
 and he went through syria and cilicia making the churches stronger in the faith
 and he came to derbe and lystra and there was a certain disciple there named timothy whose mother was one of the jews of the faith but his father was a greek
 of whom the brothers at lystra and iconium had a high opinion
 paul had a desire for him to go with him and he gave him circumcision because of the jews who were in those parts for they all had knowledge that his father was a greek
 and on their way through the towns they gave them the rules which had been made by the apostles and the rulers of the church at jerusalem so that they might keep them
 so the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day
 and after they had gone through the land of phrygia and galatia the holy spirit did not let them take the word into asia
 and having come to mysia they made an attempt to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not let them
 and going past mysia they came down to troas
 and paul had a vision in the night a man of macedonia came requesting him and saying come over into macedonia and give us help
 and when he had seen the vision straight away we made the decision to go into macedonia for it seemed certain to us that god had sent us to give the good news to them
 so from troas we went straight by ship to samothrace and the day after to neapolis
 and from there to philippi which is the most important town of macedonia and a roman colony and we were there for some days
 and on the sabbath we went outside the town by the river where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer and being seated we had talk with the women who had come together
 and a certain woman named lydia a trader in purple cloth of the town of thyatira and a god fearing woman gave ear to us whose heart the lord made open to give attention to the things which paul was saying
 and when she and her family had had baptism she made a request to us saying if it seems to you that i am true to the lord come into my house and be my guests and she made us come
