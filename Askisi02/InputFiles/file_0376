 and on the twenty third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the lord had done to david and to solomon and to israel his people
 so solomon came to the end of building the house of the lord and the kings house and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the lord and for himself had been well done
 now the lord came to solomon in a vision by night and said to him i have given ear to your prayer and have taken this place for myself as a house where offerings are to be made
 if at my word heaven is shut up so that there is no rain or if i send locusts on the land for its destruction or if i send disease on my people
 if my people on whom my name is named make themselves low and come to me in prayer searching for me and turning from their evil ways then i will give ear from heaven overlooking their sin and will give life again to their land
 now my eyes will be open and my ears awake to the prayers made in this place
 for i have taken this house for myself and made it holy so that my name may be there for ever and my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
 and as for you if you will go on your way before me as david your father did doing whatever i have given you orders to do and keeping my laws and my decisions
 then i will make strong the seat of your kingdom as i gave my word to david your father saying you will never be without a man to be ruler in israel
 but if you are turned away from me and do not keep my orders and my laws which i have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods giving them worship
 then i will have this people uprooted out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for my name i will put away from before my eyes and make it an example and a word of shame among all peoples
 and this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and will say why has the lord done so to this land and to this house
 and their answer will be because they were turned away from the lord the god of their fathers who took them out of the land of egypt and took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why he has sent all this evil on them
 now at the end of twenty years in which time solomon had put up the house of the lord and a house for himself
 he took in hand the building up of the towns which huram had given him causing the children of israel to make living places for themselves there
 and solomon went to hamath zobah and overcame it
 and he put up the buildings of tadmor in the waste land and of all the store towns in hamath
 and of beth horon the higher and the lower walled towns with walls and doorways and locks
 and of baalath and all the store towns which solomon had and the towns where he kept his war carriages and his horse men and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land under his rule
 as for all the rest of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites who were not of israel
 their men who were still living in the land and whom the children of israel had not put an end to these solomon put to forced work as is done to this day
 but solomon did not make use of the children of israel as servants for his work they were men of war his chiefs and his captains and captains of his war carriages and his horsemen
 now these were the chief men in authority whom king solomon had two hundred and fifty of them in authority over the people
 then solomon made pharaohs daughter come up from the town of david to the house which he had made for her for he said i will not have my wife living in the house of david king of israel because those places where the ark of the lord has come are holy
 then solomon made burned offerings to the lord on the altar of the lord which he had put up in front of the covered way
 offering every day what had been ordered by moses on the sabbaths and at the new moon and at the regular feasts three times a year that is at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents
 and he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work as ordered by his father david and to the levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests to do what was needed day by day and he gave the door keepers their places in turn at every door for so david the man of god had given orders
 all the orders given by the king to the priests and levites in connection with any business or stores were done with care
 and all the work of solomon was complete from the day when he put the base of the lords house in position till solomon had come to the end of building the lords house
 then solomon went to ezion geber and to eloth by the sea in the land of edom
