 and they will be mine says the lord in the day when i make them my special property and i will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant
 then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner and the servant of god from him who is not
 for see the day is coming it is burning like an oven all the men of pride and all who do evil will be dry stems of grass and in the day which is coming they will be burned up says the lord of armies till they have not a root or a branch
 but to you who give worship to my name the sun of righteousness will come up with new life in its wings and you will go out playing like young oxen full of food
 and the evil doers will be crushed under you they will be dust under your feet in the day when i do my work says the lord of armies
 keep in mind the law of moses my servant which i gave him in horeb for all israel even the rules and the decisions
 see i am sending you elijah the prophet before the day of the lord comes that great day greatly to be feared
 and by him the hearts of fathers will be turned to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers for fear that i may come and put the earth under a curse
 the word of the lord which came to micah the morashtite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah his vision about samaria and jerusalem
 give ear you peoples all of you give attention o earth and everything in it let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy temple
 for see the lord is coming out from his place and will come down stepping on the high places of the earth
 and the mountains will be turned to water under him and the deep valleys will be broken open like wax before the fire like waters flowing down a slope
 all this is because of the wrongdoing of jacob and the sins of the children of israel what is the wrongdoing of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem
 so i will make samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine garden i will send its stones falling down into the valley uncovering its bases
 and all her pictured images will be hammered into bits and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire and all the images of her gods i will make waste for with the price of a loose woman she got them together and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back
 for this i will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief i will go uncovered and unclothed i will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches
 for her wounds may not be made well for it has come even to judah stretching up to the doorway of my people even to jerusalem
 give no word of it in gath let there be no weeping at all at beth le aphrah be rolling in the dust
 be uncovered and go away you who are living in shaphir the one living in zaanan has not come out of her town beth ezel is taken away from its base even from its resting place
 for the one living in maroth is waiting for good for evil has come down from the lord to the doorways of jerusalem
 let the war carriage be yoked to the quick running horse you who are living in lachish she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of zion for the wrongdoings of israel were seen in you
 for this cause give a parting offering to moresheth gath the daughter of achzib will be a deceit to the king of israel
 even now will the taker of your heritage come to you you who are living in mareshah the glory of israel will come to destruction for ever
 let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagles for they have been taken away from you as prisoners
 a curse on the designers of evil working on their beds  in the morning light they do it because it is in their power
 they have a desire for fields and take them by force and for houses and take them away they are cruel to a man and his family even to a man and his heritage
 for this cause the lord has said see against this family i am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away and you will be weighted down by it for it is an evil time
 in that day this saying will be said about you and this song of grief will be made the heritage of my people is measured out and there is no one to give it back those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us and complete destruction has come to us
 for this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the lord
 let not words like these be dropped they say shame and the curse will not come to the family of jacob
