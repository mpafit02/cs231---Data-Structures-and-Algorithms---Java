 and ahaz went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in jerusalem but they did not put him in the resting place of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son became king in his place
 hezekiah became king when he was twenty five years old and he was king in jerusalem for twenty nine years and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father david had done
 in the first year of his rule in the first month opening the doors of the lords house he made them strong
 and he sent for the priests and the levites and got them together in the wide place on the east side
 and said to them give ear to me o levites now make yourselves holy and make holy the house of the lord the god of your fathers and take away everything unclean from the holy place
 for our fathers have done evil sinning in the eyes of the lord our god and have given him up turning away their faces from the house of the lord and turning their backs on him
 the doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the god of israel in his holy place
 and so the wrath of the lord has come on judah and jerusalem and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame as your eyes have seen
 for see our fathers have been put to death with the sword and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this
 now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the lord the god of israel so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us
 my sons take care now for you have been marked out by the lord to come before him and to be his servants burning offerings to him
 then the levites took their places mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah among the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehallelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah
 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeuel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah
 and of the sons of heman jehuel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel
 and they got their brothers together and made themselves holy and went in as the king had said by the word of the lord to make the house of the lord clean
 and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to make it clean and everything unclean which was to be seen in the temple of the lord they took out into the outer square of the lords house and the levites got it together and took it away to the stream kidron
 on the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the lord in eight days they made the lords house holy and on the sixteenth day of the first month the work was done
 then they went in to king hezekiah and said we have made all the house of the lord clean as well as the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels and the table for the holy bread with all its vessels
 and all the vessels which were turned out by king ahaz in his sin while he was king we have put in order and made holy and now they are in their places before the altar of the lord
 then hezekiah the king got up early and got together the great men of the town and went up to the house of the lord
 and they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven he goats as a sin offering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for judah and he gave orders to the sons of aaron the priests that these were to be offered on the altar of the lord
 so they put the oxen to death and their blood was given to the priests to be drained out against the altar then they put the male sheep to death draining out their blood against the altar and they put the lambs to death draining out their blood against the altar
 then they took the he goats for the sin offering placing them before the king and the meeting of the people and they put their hands on them
 and the priests put them to death and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to take away the sin of all israel for the king gave orders that the burned offering and the sin offering were for all israel
 then he put the levites in their places in the house of the lord with brass and corded instruments of music as ordered by david and gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for the order was the lords given by his prophets
 so the levites took their places with davids instruments and the priests with their horns
 and hezekiah gave the word for the burned offering to be offered on the altar and when the burned offering was started then the song of the lord was started with the blowing of horns and with all the instruments of david king of israel
 and all the people gave worship to the sound of songs and the blowing of horns and this went on till the burned offering was ended
 and at the end of the offering the king and all who were present with him gave worship with bent heads
