 and god said to him i am god the ruler of all be fertile and have increase a nation truly a group of nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
 and the land which i gave to abraham and isaac i will give to you and to your seed after you i will give the land
 then god went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him
 and jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with god and put a drink offering on it and oil
 and he gave to the place where god had been talking with him the name of beth el
 so they went on from beth el and while they were still some distance from ephrath the pains of birth came on rachel and she had a hard time
 and when her pain was very great the woman who was helping her said have no fear for now you will have another son
 and in the hour when her life went from her  for death came to her  she gave the child the name ben oni but his father gave him the name of benjamin
 so rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to ephrath  which is beth lehem 
 and jacob put up a pillar on her resting place which is named the pillar of the resting place of rachel to this day
 and israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock
 now while they were living in that country reuben had connection with bilhah his fathers servant woman and israel had news of it
 now jacob had twelve sons the sons of leah reuben jacobs first son and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun
 the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin
 the sons of bilhah rachels servant dan and naphtali
 the sons of zilpah leahs servant gad and asher these are the sons whom jacob had in paddan aram
 and jacob came to his father isaac at mamre at kiriath arba that is hebron where abraham and isaac had been living
 and isaac was a hundred and eighty years old
 then isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his fathers people an old man after a long life and jacob and esau his sons put him in his last resting place
 now these are the generations of esau that is to say edom
 esaus wives were women of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and oholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite
 and basemath ishmaels daughter the sister of nebaioth
 adah had a son eliphaz and basemath was the mother of reuel
 oholibamah was the mother of jeush jalam and korah these are the sons of esau whose birth took place in the land of canaan
 esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the people of his house and his beasts and his cattle and all his goods which he had got together in the land of canaan and went into the land of seir away from his brother jacob
 for their wealth was so great that the land was not wide enough for the two of them and all their cattle
 so esau made his living place in the hill country of seir  esau is edom 
 and these are the generations of esau the father of the edomites in the hill country of seir
 these are the names of esaus sons eliphaz the son of esaus wife adah and reuel the son of esaus wife basemath
 the sons of eliphaz were teman omar zepho gatam and kenaz
