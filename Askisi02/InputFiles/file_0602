 and zilpah leahs servant gave birth to a second son
 and leah said happy am i  and all women will give witness to my joy and she gave him the name asher
 now at the time of the grain cutting reuben saw some love fruits in the field and took them to his mother leah and rachel said to her let me have some of your sons love fruits
 but leah said to her is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me and now would you take my sons love fruits then rachel said you may have him tonight in exchange for your sons love fruits
 in the evening when jacob came in from the field leah went out to him and said tonight you are to come to me for i have given my sons love fruits as a price for you and he went in to her that night
 and god gave ear to her and she became with child and gave jacob a fifth son
 then leah said god has made payment to me for giving my servant girl to my husband so she gave her son the name issachar
 and again leah became with child and she gave jacob a sixth son
 and she said god has given me a good bride price now at last will i have my husband living with me for i have given him six sons and she gave him the name zebulun
 after that she had a daughter to whom she gave the name dinah
 then god gave thought to rachel and hearing her prayer he made her fertile
 and she was with child and gave birth to a son and she said god has taken away my shame
 and she gave him the name joseph saying may the lord give me another son
 now after the birth of joseph jacob said to laban let me go away to my place and my country
 give me my wives and my children for whom i have been your servant and let me go for you have knowledge of all the work i have done for you
 and laban said if you will let me say so do not go away for i have seen by the signs that the lord has been good to me because of you
 say then what your payment is to be and i will give it
 then jacob said you have seen what i have done for you and how your cattle have done well under my care
 for before i came you had little and it has been greatly increased and the lord has given you a blessing in everything i have done but when am i to do something for my family
 and laban said what am i to give you and jacob said do not give me anything but i will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me
 let me go through all your flock today taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black and all the marked or coloured goats these will be my payment
 and so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured or any sheep which is not black you may take me for a thief
 and laban said let it be as you say
 so that day he took all the he goats which were banded or coloured and all the she goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks and all the black sheep and gave them into the care of his sons
 and sent them three days journey away and jacob took care of the rest of labans flock
 then jacob took young branches of trees cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands
 and he put the banded sticks in the drinking places where the flock came to get water and they became with young when they came to the water
 and because of this the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour
 these lambs jacob kept separate and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with labans flock
 and whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking places so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks
