 give orders to aaron and to his sons to keep themselves separate from the holy things of the children of israel which they give to me and not to make my holy name common i am the lord
 say to them if any man of all your seed through all your generations being unclean comes near the holy things which the children of israel make holy to the lord he will be cut off from before me i am the lord
 no man of the seed of aaron who is a leper or who has a flow from his body may take of the holy food till he is clean and any man touching anything which is unclean because of the dead or any man whose seed goes from him
 or anyone touching any unclean thing which goes flat on the earth or someone by whom he may be made unclean in any way whatever
 any person touching any such unclean thing will be unclean till evening and may not take of the holy food till his flesh has been bathed in water
 and when the sun has gone down he will be clean and after that he may take part in the holy food because it is his bread
 that which comes to a natural death or is attacked by beasts he may not take as food for it will make him unclean i am the lord
 so then let them keep what i have put into their care for fear that sin may come on them because of it so causing their death because they have made it common i am the lord who make them holy
 no outside person may take of the holy food or one living as a guest in the priests house or a servant working for payment
 but any person for whom the priest has given money to make him his may take of it with him and those who come to birth in his house may take of his bread
 and if the daughter of a priest is married to an outside person she may not take of the holy things which are lifted up as offerings
 but if a priests daughter is a widow or parted from her husband and has no child and has come back to her fathers house as when she was a girl she may take of her fathers bread but no outside person may do so
 and if a man takes the holy food in error he will have to give the holy thing back to the priest with the addition of a fifth part
 and they may not make common the holy things which the children of israel give to the lord
 so causing sin to come on them when they take their holy things for food i am the lord who make them holy
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel if any man of the children of israel or of another nation living in israel makes an offering given because of an oath or freely given to the lord for a burned offering
 so that it may be pleasing to the lord let him give a male without any mark from among the oxen or the sheep or the goats
 but anything which has a mark you may not give it will not make you pleasing to the lord
 and whoever makes a peace offering to the lord in payment of an oath or as a free offering from the herd or the flock if it is to be pleasing to the lord let it be free from any mark or damage
 anything blind or broken or damaged or having any disease or any mark on it may not be offered to the lord you may not make an offering of it by fire on the altar to the lord
 an ox or a lamb which has more or less than its natural parts may be given as a free offering but it will not be taken in payment of an oath
 an animal which has its sex parts damaged or crushed or broken or cut may not be offered to the lord such a thing may not be done anywhere in your land
 and from one who is not an israelite you may not take any of these for an offering to the lord for they are unclean there is a mark on them and the lord will not be pleased with them
 and the lord said to moses
 when an ox or a sheep or a goat is given birth let it be with its mother for seven days and after the eighth day it may be taken as an offering made by fire to the lord
 a cow or a sheep may not be put to death with its young on the same day
 and when you make an offering of praise to the lord make it in a way which is pleasing to him
 let it be used for food on the same day do not keep any part of it till the morning i am the lord
 so then keep my orders and do them i am the lord
