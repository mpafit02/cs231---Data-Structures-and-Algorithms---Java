 so they took jonah up and put him into the sea and the sea was no longer angry
 then great was the mens fear of the lord and they made an offering to the lord and took oaths to him
 and the lord made ready a great fish to take jonah into its mouth and jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights
 then jonah made prayer to the lord his god from the inside of the fish and said
 in my trouble i was crying to the lord and he gave me an answer out of the deepest underworld i sent up a cry and you gave ear to my voice
 for you have put me down into the deep into the heart of the sea and the river was round about me all your waves and your rolling waters went over me
 and i said i have been sent away from before your eyes how may i ever again see your holy temple
 the waters were circling round me even to the neck the deep was about me the sea grass was twisted round my head
 i went down to the bases of the mountains as for the earth her walls were about me for ever but you have taken up my life from the underworld o lord my god
 when my soul in me was overcome i kept the memory of the lord and my prayer came in to you into your holy temple
 the worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope
 but i will make an offering to you with the voice of praise i will give effect to my oaths salvation is the lords
 and at the lords order the fish sent jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land
 and the word of the lord came to jonah a second time saying
 up  go to nineveh that great town and give it the word which i have given you
 so jonah got up and went to nineveh as the lord had said now nineveh was a very great town three days journey from end to end
 and jonah first of all went a days journey into the town and crying out said in forty days destruction will overtake nineveh
 and the people of nineveh had belief in god and a time was fixed for going without food and they put on haircloth from the greatest to the least
 and the word came to the king of nineveh and he got up from his seat of authority and took off his robe and covering himself with haircloth took his seat in the dust
 and he had it given out in nineveh by the order of the king and his great men no man or beast herd or flock is to have a taste of anything let them have no food or water
 and let man and beast be covered with haircloth and let them make strong prayers to god and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands
 who may say that god will not be turned changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath so that destruction may not overtake us
 and god saw what they did how they were turned from their evil way and gods purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them and he did it not
 but this seemed very wrong to jonah and he was angry
 and he made prayer to the lord and said o lord is this not what i said when i was still in my country this is why i took care to go in flight to tarshish for i was certain that you were a loving god full of pity slow to be angry and great in mercy and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil
 so now o lord give ear to my prayer and take my life from me for death is better for me than life
 and the lord said have you any right to be angry
 then jonah went out of the town and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town
 and the lord god made a vine come up over jonah to give him shade over his head and jonah was very glad because of the vine
 but early on the morning after god made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine and it became dry and dead
