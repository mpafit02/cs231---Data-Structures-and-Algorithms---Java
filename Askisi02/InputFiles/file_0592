 then abraham went back to his young men and they went together to beer sheba the place where abraham was living
 after these things abraham had news that milcah the wife of his brother nahor had given birth to children
 uz the oldest and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
 and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
 bethuel was the father of rebekah these eight were the children of milcah and nahor abrahams brother
 and his servant reumah gave birth to tebah and gaham and tahash and maacah
 now the years of sarahs life were a hundred and twenty seven
 and sarahs death took place in kiriath arba that is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham went into his house weeping and sorrowing for sarah
 and abraham came from his dead and said to the children of heth
 i am living among you as one from a strange country give me some land here as my property so that i may put my dead to rest
 and in answer the children of heth said to abraham
 my lord truly you are a great chief among us take the best of our resting places for your dead not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest
 and abraham got up and gave honour to the children of heth the people of that land
 and he said to them if you will let me put my dead to rest here make a request for me to ephron the son of zohar
 that he will give me the hollow in the rock named machpelah which is his property at the end of his field let him give it to me for its full price as a resting place for my dead among you
 now ephron was seated among the children of heth and ephron the hittite gave abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of heth and of all those who came into his town saying
 no my lord i will give you the field with the hollow in the rock before all the children of my people will i give it to you for a resting place for your dead
 and abraham went down on his face before the people of the land
 and abraham said to ephron in the hearing of the people of the land if only you will give ear to me i will give you the price of the field take it and let me put my dead to rest there
 so ephron said to abraham
 my lord give ear to me the value of the land is four hundred shekels what is that between me and you so put your dead to rest there
 and abraham took note of the price fixed by ephron in the hearing of the children of heth and gave him four hundred shekels in current money
 so ephrons field at machpelah near mamre with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it
 became the property of abraham before the eyes of the children of heth and of all who came into the town
 then abraham put sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of machpelah near mamre that is hebron in the land of canaan
 and the field and the hollow rock were handed over to abraham as his property by the children of heth
 now abraham was old and far on in years and the lord had given him everything in full measure
 and abraham said to his chief servant the manager of all his property come now put your hand under my leg
 and take an oath by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that you will not get a wife for my son isaac from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i am living
 but that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son isaac
