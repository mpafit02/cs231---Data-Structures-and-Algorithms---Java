 have mercy on me o lord for my cry goes up to you all the day
 make glad the soul of your servant for it is lifted up to you o lord
 you are good o lord and full of forgiveness your mercy is great to all who make their cry to you
 o lord give ear to my prayer and take note of the sound of my requests
 in the day of my trouble i send up my cry to you for you will give me an answer
 there is no god like you o lord there are no works like your works
 let all the nations whom you have made come and give worship to you o lord giving glory to your name
 for you are great and do great works of wonder you only are god
 make your way clear to me o lord i will go on my way in your faith let my heart be glad in the fear of your name
 i will give you praise o lord my god with all my heart i will give glory to your name for ever
 for your mercy to me is great you have taken my soul up from the deep places of the underworld
 o god men of pride have come up against me and the army of violent men would take my life they have not put you before them
 but you o lord are a god full of pity and forgiveness slow to get angry great in mercy and wisdom
 o be turned to me and have mercy on me give your strength to your servant and your salvation to the son of her who is your servant
 give me a sign for good so that my haters may see it and be shamed because you lord have been my help and comfort
 &ltof the sons of korah a psalm a song&gt this house is resting on the holy mountain
 the lord has more love for the doors of zion than for all the tents of jacob
 noble things are said of you o town of god  selah 
 rahab and babylon will be named among those who have knowledge of me see philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man had his birth there
 and of zion it will be said this or that man had his birth there and the most high will make her strong
 the lord will keep in mind when he is writing the records of the people that this man had his birth there  selah 
 the players on instruments will be there and the dancers will say all my springs are in you
 &lta song a psalm of the sons of korah to the chief music maker put to mahalath leannoth maschil of heman the ezrahite&gt o lord god of my salvation i have been crying to you for help by day and by night
 let my prayer come before you give ear to my cry
 for my soul is full of evils and my life has come near to the underworld
 i am numbered among those who go down into the earth i have become like a man for whom there is no help
 my soul is among the dead like those in the underworld to whom you give no more thought for they are cut off from your care
 you have put me in the lowest deep even in dark places
 the weight of your wrath is crushing me all your waves have overcome me  selah 
 you have sent my friends far away from me you have made me a disgusting thing in their eyes i am shut up and not able to come out
