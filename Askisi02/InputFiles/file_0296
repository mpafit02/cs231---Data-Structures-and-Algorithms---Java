 now king david was old and far on in years and though they put covers over him his body was cold
 so his servants said to him let search be made for a young virgin for my lord the king to take care of him and be waiting on him and you may take her in your arms and so my lord the king will be warm
 so after searching through all the land of israel for a fair young girl they saw abishag the shunammite and took her to the king
 now she was very beautiful and she took care of the king waiting on him at all times but the king had no connection with her
 then adonijah the son of haggith lifting himself up in pride said i will become king and he made ready his carriages of war and his horsemen with fifty runners to go before him
 now all his life his father had never gone against him or said to him why have you done so and he was a very good looking man and younger than absalom
 and he had talk with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they were on his side and gave him their support
 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and davids men of war did not take the side of adonijah
 then adonijah put to death sheep and oxen and fat beasts by the stone of zoheleth by en rogel and he sent for all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants to come to him
 but he did not send for nathan the prophet and benaiah and the other men of war and solomon his brother
 then nathan said to bath sheba the mother of solomon has it not come to your ears that adonijah the son of haggith has made himself king without the knowledge of david our lord
 so now let me make a suggestion so that you may keep your life safe and the life of your son solomon
 come now go to king david and say to him did you not o my lord take an oath to me your servant saying truly solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom why then is adonijah acting as king
 and while you are still talking there with the king see i will come in after you and say that your story is true
 then bath sheba went into the kings room now the king was very old and abishag the shunammite was waiting on him
 and bath sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour and he said what is your desire
