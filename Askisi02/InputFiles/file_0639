 i will have nothing to do with your young ox o samaria my wrath is burning against them how long will it be before the children of israel make themselves clean
 the workman made it it is no god the ox of samaria will be broken into bits
 for they have been planting the wind and their fruit will be the storm his grain has no stem it will give no meal and if it does a strange nation will take it
 israel has come to destruction now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure
 for they have gone up to assyria like an ass going by himself ephraim has given money to get lovers
 but though they give money to the nations for help still i will send them in all directions and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers
 because ephraim has been increasing altars for sin altars have become a cause of sin to him
 though i put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules they are to him as a strange thing
 he gives the offerings of his lovers and takes the flesh for food but the lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep in mind their evil doing and give them the punishment of their sins they will go back to egypt
 for israel has no memory of his maker and has put up the houses of kings and judah has made great the number of his walled towns but i will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses
 have no joy o israel and do not be glad like the nations for you have been untrue to your god your desire has been for the loose womans reward on every grain floor
 the grain floor and the place where the grapes are crushed will not give them food there will be no new wine for them
 they will have no resting place in the lords land but ephraim will go back to egypt and they will take unclean food in assyria
 they will give no wine offering to the lord they will not make offerings ready for him their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow all who take it will be unclean because their bread will be only for their desire it will not come into the house of the lord
 what will you do on the day of worship and on the day of the feast of the lord
 for see they are going away into assyria egypt will get them together memphis will be their last resting place their fair silver vessels will be covered over with field plants and thorns will come up in their tents
 the days of punishment the days of reward are come israel will be put to shame the prophet is foolish the man who has the spirit is off his head because of your great sin
 there is great hate against the watchman of ephraim the people of my god as for the prophet there is a net in all his ways and hate in the house of his god
 they have gone deep in evil as in the days of gibeah he will keep in mind their wrongdoing he will give them punishment for their sins
 i made discovery of israel as of grapes in the waste land i saw your fathers as the first fruits of the fig tree in her early fruit time but they came to baal peor and made themselves holy to the thing of shame and became disgusting like that to which they gave their love
 as for ephraim their glory will go in flight like a bird there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life
 even though their children have come to growth i will take them away so that not a man will be there for their evil doing will be complete and they will be put to shame because of it
 as i have seen a beast whose young have been taken from her so ephraim will give birth to children only for them to be put to death
 o lord what will you give them give them bodies which may not give birth and breasts without milk
 all their evil doing is in gilgal there i had hate for them because of their evil doing i will send them out of my house they will no longer be dear to me all their rulers are uncontrolled
 the rod has come on ephraim their root is dry let them have no fruit even though they give birth i will put to death the dearest fruit of their bodies
 my god will give them up because they did not give ear to him they will be wandering among the nations
 the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw about judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah
 give ear o heavens and you o earth to the word which the lord has said i have taken care of my children till they became men but their hearts have been turned away from me
 even the ox has knowledge of its owner and the ass of the place where its master puts its food but israel has no knowledge my people give no thought to me
