 for so i was ordered by the word of the lord who said you are not to take food or a drink of water and you are not to go back the way you came
 so he went another way and not by the way he came to beth el
 now there was an old prophet living in beth el and one of his sons came and gave him word of all the man of god had done that day in beth el and they gave their father an account of the words he had said to the king
 then their father said to them which way did he go now his sons had seen which way the man of god who came from judah had gone
 so the prophet said to his sons make ready an ass for me so they made an ass ready and he got on it
 and went after the man of god and came up with him while he was seated under an oak tree and he said to him are you the man of god who came from judah and he said i am
 then he said to him come back to the house with me and have a meal
 but he said i may not go back with you or go into your house and i will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place
 for the lord said to me you are not to take food or water there or go back again by the way you came
 then he said to him i am a prophet like you and an angel said to me by the word of the lord take him back with you and give him food and water but he said false words to him
 so he went back with him and had a meal in his house and a drink of water
 but while they were seated at the table the word of the lord came to the prophet who had taken him back
 and crying out to the man of god who came from judah he said the lord says because you have gone against the voice of the lord and have not done as you were ordered by the lord
 but have come back and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers
 now after the meal he made ready the ass for him for the prophet whom he had taken back
 and he went on his way but on the road a lion came rushing at him and put him to death and his dead body was stretched in the road with the ass by its side and the lion was there by the body
 and some men going by saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side and they came and gave news of it in the town where the old prophet was living
 then the prophet who had made him come back hearing it said it is the man of god who went against the word of the lord that is why the lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death as the lord said
 and he said to his sons make ready the ass for me and they did so
 and he went and saw the dead body stretched out in the road with the ass and the lion by its side the lion had not taken the body for its food or done any damage to the ass
 then the prophet took up the body of the man of god and put it on the ass and took it back and he came to the town to put the body to rest with weeping
 and he put the body in the resting place made ready for himself weeping and sorrowing over it saying o my brother 
 and when he had put it to rest he said to his sons when i am dead then you are to put my body into the earth with the body of this man of god and put me by his bones so that my bones may be kept safe with his bones
 for the outcry he made by the word of the lord against the altar in beth el and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of samaria will certainly come about
 after this jeroboam not turning back from his evil ways still made priests for his altars from among all the people he made a priest of anyone desiring it so that there might be priests of the high places
 and this became a sin in the family of jeroboam causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth
 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam became ill
 and jeroboam said to his wife now come put on different clothing so that you may not seem to be the wife of jeroboam and go to shiloh see ahijah is there the prophet who said i would be king over this people
 and take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey and go to him he will give you word of what is to become of the child
 so jeroboams wife did so and got up and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah now ahijah was unable to see because he was very old
