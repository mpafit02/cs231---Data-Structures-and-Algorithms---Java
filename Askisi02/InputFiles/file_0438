 but you have been lifting yourself up against the lord of heaven and they have put the vessels of his house before you and you and your lords your wives and your women have taken wine in them and you have given praise to gods of silver and gold of brass and iron and wood and stone who are without the power of seeing or hearing and without knowledge and to the god in whose hand your breath is and whose are all your ways you have not given glory
 then the part of the hand was sent out from before him and this writing was recorded
 and this is the writing which was recorded mene tekel peres
 this is the sense of the words mene your kingdom has been numbered by god and ended
 tekel you have been put in the scales and seen to be under weight
 peres your kingdom has been cut up and given to the medes and persians
 then by the order of belshazzar they put a purple robe on daniel and a gold chain round his neck and a public statement was made that he was to be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 that very night belshazzar the king of the chaldaeans was put to death
 and darius the mede took the kingdom being then about sixty two years old
 darius was pleased to put over the kingdom a hundred and twenty captains who were to be all through the kingdom
 and over them were three chief rulers of whom daniel was one and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers so that the king might undergo no loss
 then this daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains because there was a special spirit in him and it was the kings purpose to put him over all the kingdom
 then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him because he was true and no error or wrong was to be seen in him
 then these men said we will only get a reason for attacking daniel in connection with the law of his god
 then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him o king darius have life for ever
 all the chief rulers of the kingdom the chiefs and the captains the wise men and the rulers have made a common decision to put in force a law having the kings authority and to give a strong order that whoever makes any request to any god or man but you o king for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole
 now o king put the order in force signing the writing so that it may not be changed like the law of the medes and persians which may not come to an end
 for this reason king darius put his name on the writing and the order
 and daniel on hearing that the writing had been signed went into his house  now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of jerusalem  and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and praise before his god as he had done before
 then these men were watching and saw daniel making prayers and requesting grace before his god
 then they came near before the king and said o king have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you o king for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole the king made answer and said the thing is fixed by the law of the medes and persians which may not come to an end
 then they made answer and said before the king daniel one of the prisoners of judah has no respect for you o king or for the order signed by you but three times a day he makes his prayer to god
 when this thing came to the kings ears it was very evil to him and his heart was fixed on keeping daniel safe and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free
 then these men said to the king be certain o king that by the law of the medes and persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed
 then the king gave the order and they took daniel and put him into the lions hole the king made answer and said to daniel your god whose servant you are at all times will keep you safe
 then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole and it was stamped with the kings stamp and with the stamp of the lords so that the decision about daniel might not be changed
 then the king went to his great house and took no food that night and no  were placed before him and his sleep went from him
 then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions hole
 and when he came near the hole where daniel was he gave a loud cry of grief the king made answer and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is your god whose servant you are at all times able to keep you safe from the lions
 then daniel said to the king o king have life for ever
