 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia say these things says he who is holy he who is true he who has the key of david opening the door so that it may be shut by no one and shutting it so that it may be open to no one
 i have knowledge of your works  see i have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one  and that you have a little strength and have kept my word and have been true to my name
 see i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say they are jews and are not but say what is false i will make them come and give worship before your feet and see my love for you
 because you have kept my word in quiet strength i will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world to put to the test those who are on earth
 i come quickly keep that which you have so that no one may take your crown
 him who overcomes i will make a pillar in the house of my god and he will go out no more and i will put on him the name of my god and the name of the town of my god the new jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my god and my new name
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 and to the angel of the church in laodicea say these things says the true and certain witness the head of gods new order
 i have knowledge of your works that you are not cold or warm it would be better if you were cold or warm
 so because you are not one thing or the other i will have no more to do with you
 for you say i have wealth and have got together goods and land and have need of nothing and you are not conscious of your sad and unhappy condition that you are poor and blind and without clothing
 if you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire so that you may have true wealth and white robes to put on so that your shame may not be seen and oil for your eyes so that you may see
 to all those who are dear to me i give sharp words and punishment then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways
 see i am waiting at the door and giving the sign if my voice comes to any mans ears and he makes the door open i will come in to him and will take food with him and he with me
 to him who overcomes i will give a place with me on my high seat even as i overcame and am seated with my father on his high seat
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 after these things i saw a door open in heaven and the first voice came to my ears like the sound of a horn saying come up here and i will make clear to you the things which are to come
 straight away i was in the spirit and i saw a high seat in heaven and one was seated on it
 and to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone and there was an arch of light round the high seat like an emerald
 and round about the high seat were four and twenty seats and on them i saw four and twenty rulers seated clothed in white robes and on their heads crowns of gold
 and out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders and seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat which are the seven spirits of god
 and before the high seat there was as it seemed a clear sea of glass and in the middle of the high seat and round about it four beasts full of eyes round about
 and the first beast was like a lion and the second like an ox and the third had a face like a man and the fourth was like an eagle in flight
 and the four beasts having every one of them six wings are full of eyes round about and inside and without resting day and night they say holy holy holy lord god ruler of all who was and is and is to come
 and when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat to him who is living for ever and ever
 the four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever and take off their crowns before the high seat saying
 it is right our lord and our god for you to have glory and honour and power because by you were all things made and by your desire they came into being
 and i saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat a book with writing inside it and on the back shut with seven stamps of wax
 and i saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice who is able to make the book open and to undo its stamps
 and no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to get the book open or to see what was in it
