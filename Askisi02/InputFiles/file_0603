 but when the flocks were feeble he did not put the sticks before them so that the feebler flocks were labans and the stronger were jacobs
 so jacobs wealth was greatly increased he had great flocks and women servants and men servants and camels and asses
 now it came to the ears of jacob that labans sons were saying jacob has taken away all our fathers property and in this way he has got all this wealth
 and jacob saw that labans feeling for him was no longer what it had been before
 then the lord said to jacob go back to the land of your fathers and to your relations and i will be with you
 and jacob sent for rachel and leah to come to him in the field among his flock
 and he said to them it is clear to me that your fathers feeling is no longer what it was to me but the god of my father has been with me
 and you have seen how i have done all in my power for your father
 but your father has not kept faith with me and ten times he has made changes in my payment but god has kept him from doing me damage
 if he said all those in the flock which have marks are to be yours then all the flock gave birth to marked young and if he said all the banded ones are to be yours then all the flock had banded young
 so god has taken away your fathers cattle and has given them to me
 and at the time when the flock were with young i saw in a dream that all the he goats which were joined with the she goats were banded and marked and coloured
 and in my dream the angel of the lord said to me jacob and i said here am i
 and he said see how all the he goats are banded and marked and coloured for i have seen what laban has done to you
 i am the god of beth el where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me now then come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth
 then rachel and leah said to him in answer what part or heritage is there for us in our fathers house
 are we not as people from a strange country to him for he took a price for us and now it is all used up
 for the wealth which god has taken from him is ours and our childrens so now whatever god has said to you do
 then jacob put his wives and his sons on camels
 and sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in paddan aram he made ready to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
 now laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep so rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her fathers house
 and jacob went away secretly without giving news of his flight to laban the aramaean
 so he went away with all he had and went across the river in the direction of the hill country of gilead
 and on the third day laban had news of jacobs flight
 and taking the men of his family with him he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill country of gilead
 then god came to laban in a dream by night and said to him take care that you say nothing good or bad to jacob
 now when laban overtook him jacob had put up his tent in the hill country and laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill country of gilead
 and laban said to jacob why did you go away secretly taking my daughters away like prisoners of war
 why did you make a secret of your flight not giving me word of it so that i might have sent you away with joy and songs with melody and music
 you did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters this was a foolish thing to do
