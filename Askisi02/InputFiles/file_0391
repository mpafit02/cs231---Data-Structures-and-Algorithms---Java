 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as manasseh his father had done
 he went in all the ways of his father being a servant and worshipper of the false gods to which his father had been a servant
 turning away from the lord the god of his fathers and not walking in his ways
 and the servants of amon made a secret design against him and put the king to death in his house
 but the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king and made josiah his son king in his place
 now the rest of the acts which amon did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 he was put in his last resting place in the garden of uzza and josiah his son became king in his place
 josiah was eight years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for thirty one years his mothers name was jedidah daughter of adaiah of bozkath
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of david his father without turning to the right hand or to the left
 now in the eighteenth year after he became king josiah sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying to him
 go up to hilkiah the chief priest and let him give out the money which is taken into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have got together from the people
 and let it be given to the overseers of the work of the lords house to give to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the house of the lord
 to the woodworkers and the builders and the stone cutters and for getting wood and cut stones for the building up of the house
 they did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them for they made use of it with good faith
 then hilkiah the chief priest said to shaphan the scribe i have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the lord so hilkiah gave it to shaphan
 then after reading it shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done saying your servants have given out the money which was in the house and have given it to the overseers of the work of the house of the lord
 then shaphan the scribe said to the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he was reading it before the king
 and the king hearing the words of the book of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
 and he gave orders to hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of micaiah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying
 go and get directions from the lord for me and for the people and for all judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the lord which is burning against us because our fathers have not given ear to the words of this book to do all the things which are recorded in it
 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asaiah went to huldah the woman prophet the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the robes  now she was living in jerusalem in the second part of the town  and they had talk with her
 and she said to them the lord the god of israel says say to the man who sent you to me
 these are the words of the lord see i will send evil on this place and on its people even everything which the king of judah has been reading in the book
 because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the work of their hands so my wrath will be on fire against this place and will not be put out
 but to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from the lord say this is what the lord the god of israel has said as to the words which have come to your ears
 because your heart was soft and you made yourself low before me when you had word of what i said against this place and its people that they would become a waste and a curse and you gave signs of grief weeping before me truly i have given ear to you says the lord
 for this cause i will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting place in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which i will send on this place so they took this news back to the king
 then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of judah and of jerusalem
 and the king went up to the house of the lord with all the men of judah and all the people of jerusalem and the priests and the prophets and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the lord
 and the king took his place by the pillar and made an agreement before the lord to go in the way of the lord and keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in the book and all the people gave their word to keep the agreement
