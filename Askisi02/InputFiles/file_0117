 they took him first to annas because annas was the father in law of caiaphas who was the high priest that year
 it was caiaphas who had said to the jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people
 and simon peter went after jesus with another disciple now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with jesus into the house of the high priest
 but peter was kept outside at the door then this other disciple who was a friend of the high priest came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door and took peter in
 then the girl who was the door keeper said to peter are you not one of this mans disciples in answer he said i am not
 now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold they were warming themselves in front of it and peter was there with them warming himself
 then the high priest put questions to jesus about his disciples and his teaching
 jesus made answer i said things openly to the world at all times i have given my teaching in the synagogues and in the temple to which all the jews come and i have said nothing secretly
 why are you questioning me put questions to my hearers about what i have said to them they have knowledge of what i said
 when he said this one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand saying do you give such an answer to the high priest
 jesus said in answer if i have said anything evil give witness to the evil but if i said what is true why do you give me blows
 then annas sent him chained to caiaphas the high priest
 but simon peter was still there warming himself by the fire they said to him are you not one of his disciples he said no i am not
 one of the servants of the high priest a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by peter said did i not see you with him in the garden
 then again peter said no and straight away a cock gave its cry
 so they took jesus from the house of caiaphas to the praetorium it was early they themselves did not go into the praetorium so that they might not become unclean but might take the passover
 so pilate came out to them and put the question what have you to say against this man
 they said to him in answer if the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you
 then pilate said to them take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law but the jews said to him we have no right to put any man to death
  that the word of jesus might come true pointing to the sort of death he would have 
 then pilate went back into the praetorium and sent for jesus and said to him are you the king of the jews
 jesus made answer do you say this of yourself or did others say it about me
 pilate said am i a jew your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands what have you done
 jesus said in answer my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the jews but my kingdom is not here
 then pilate said to him are you then a king jesus made answer you say that i am a king for this purpose was i given birth and for this purpose i came into the world that i might give witness to what is true every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice
 pilate said to him true what is true having said this he went out again to the jews and said to them i see no wrong in him
 but every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the passover is it your desire that i let the king of the jews go free
 then again they gave a loud cry not this man but barabbas now barabbas was an outlaw
 then pilate took jesus and had him whipped with cords
 and the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put a purple robe on him
