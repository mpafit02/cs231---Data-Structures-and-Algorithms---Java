 and i will let your numbers be increased all the children of israel even all of them and the towns will be peopled and the waste places will have buildings
 man and beast will be increased in you and they will have offspring and be fertile i will make you thickly peopled as you were before and will do more for you than at the first and you will be certain that i am the lord
 yes i will have you walked on by the feet of men even my people israel they will have you for a heritage and you will be theirs and never again will you take their children from them
 this is what the lord has said because they say to you you o land are the destruction of men causing loss of children to your nation
 for this reason you will no longer take the lives of men and will never again be the cause of loss of children to your nation says the lord
 and i will not let the shaming of the nations come to your ears and no longer will you be looked down on by the peoples says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man when the children of israel were living in their land they made it unclean by their way and their acts their way before me was as when a woman is unclean at the time when she is kept separate
 so i let loose my wrath on them because of those whom they had violently put to death in the land and because they had made it unclean with their images
 and i sent them in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries i was their judge rewarding them for their way and their acts
 and when they came among the nations wherever they went they made my holy name unclean when it was said of them these are the people of the lord who have gone out from his land
 but i had pity for my holy name which the children of israel had made unclean wherever they went
 for this cause say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said i am doing this not because of you o children of israel but because of my holy name which you have made unclean among the nations wherever you went
 and i will make holy my great name which has been made unclean among the nations which you have made unclean among them and it will be clear to the nations that i am the lord says the lord when i make myself holy in you before their eyes
 for i will take you out from among the nations and get you together from all the countries and take you into your land
 and i will put clean water on you so that you may be clean from all your unclean ways and from all your images i will make you clean
 and i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you i will take away the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh
 and i will put my spirit in you causing you to be guided by my rules and you will keep my orders and do them
 so that you may go on living in the land which i gave to your fathers and you will be to me a people and i will be to you a god
 and i will make you free from all your unclean ways and at my voice the grain will come up and be increased and i will not let you be short of food
 and i will make the tree give more fruit and the field fuller produce and no longer will you be shamed among the nations for need of food
 and at the memory of your evil ways and your wrongdoings you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of your evil doings and your disgusting ways o children of israel
 not because of you am i doing it says the lord let it be clear to you and be shamed and made low because of your ways o children of israel
 this is what the lord has said in the day when i make you clean from all your evil doings i will let the towns be peopled and there will be building on the waste places
 and the land which was waste will be farmed in place of being a waste in the eyes of everyone who went by
 and they will say this land which was waste has become like the garden of eden and the towns which were unpeopled and wasted and pulled down are walled and peopled
 then the rest of the nations round about you will be certain that i the lord am the builder of the places which were pulled down and the planter of that which was waste i the lord have said it and i will do it
 this is what the lord has said the children of israel will again make prayer to me for this that i may do it for them i will make them increased with men like a flock
 like sheep for the offerings like the sheep of jerusalem at her fixed feasts so the unpeopled towns will be made full of men and they will be certain that i am the lord
 the hand of the lord had been on me and he took me out in the spirit of the lord and put me down in the middle of the valley and it was full of bones
