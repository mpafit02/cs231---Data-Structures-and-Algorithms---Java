 for the lord god is my helper i will not be put to shame so i have made my face like a rock and i am certain that he will give me my right
 he who takes up my cause is near who will go to law with me let us come together before the judge who is against me let him come near to me
 see the lord god is my helper who will give a decision against me truly all of them will become old like a robe they will be food for the worm
 who among you has the fear of the lord giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light let him put his faith in the name of the lord looking to his god for support
 see all you who make a fire arming yourselves with burning branches go in the flame of your fire and among the branches you have put a light to this will you have from my hand you will make your bed in sorrow
 give ear to me you who are searching for righteousness who are looking for the lord see the rock from which you were cut out and the hole out of which you were taken
 let your thoughts be turned to abraham your father and to sarah who gave you birth for when he was but one my voice came to him and i gave him my blessing and made him a great people
 for the lord has given comfort to zion he has made glad all her broken walls making her waste places like eden and changing her dry land into the garden of the lord joy and delight will be there praise and the sound of melody
 give attention to me o my people and give ear to me o my nation for teaching will go out from me and the knowledge of the true god will be a light to the peoples
 suddenly will my righteousness come near and my salvation will be shining out like the light the sea lands will be waiting for me and they will put their hope in my strong arm
 let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens and turned to the earth which is under them for the heavens will go in flight like smoke and the earth will become old like a coat and its people will come to destruction like insects but my salvation will be for ever and my righteousness will not come to an end
 give ear to me you who have knowledge of righteousness in whose heart is my law have no fear of the evil words of men and give no thought to their curses
 for like a coat they will be food for the insect the worm will make a meal of them like wool but my righteousness will be for ever and my salvation to all generations
 awake  awake  put on strength o arm of the lord awake  as in the old days in the generations long past was it not by you that rahab was cut in two and the dragon wounded
 did you not make the sea dry the waters of the great deep did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the lords people to go through
 those whom the lord has made free will come back with songs to zion and on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
 i even i am your comforter are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end and of the son of man who will be like grass
 and you have given no thought to the lord your maker by whom the heavens were stretched out and the earth placed on its base and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one when he was making ready for your destruction and where is the wrath of the cruel one
 the prisoner bent under his chain will quickly be made free and will not go down into the underworld and his bread will not come to an end
 for i am the lord your god who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering the lord of armies is his name
 and i have put my words in your mouth covering you with the shade of my hand stretching out the heavens and placing the earth on its base and saying to zion you are my people
 awake  awake  up  o jerusalem you who have taken from the lords hand the cup of his wrath tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes
 she has no one among all her children to be her guide not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand
 these two things have come on you who will be weeping for you wasting and destruction death from need of food and from the sword how may you be comforted
 your sons are overcome like a roe in a net they are full of the wrath of the lord the punishment of your god
 so now give ear to this you who are troubled and overcome but not with wine
 this is the word of the lord your master even your god who takes up the cause of his people see i have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes even the cup of my wrath it will not again be given to you
 and i will put it into the hand of your cruel masters and of those whose yoke has been hard on you who have said to your soul down on your face  so that we may go over you and you have given your backs like the earth even like the street for them to go over
 awake  awake  put on your strength o zion put on your beautiful robes o jerusalem the holy town for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision
 make yourself clean from the dust up  and take the seat of your power o jerusalem the bands of your neck are loose o prisoned daughter of zion
