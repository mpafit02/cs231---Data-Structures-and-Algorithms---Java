 or if i send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste so that no man may go through because of the beasts
 even if these three men were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves and the land would be made waste
 or if i send a sword against that land and say sword go through the land cutting off from it man and beast
 even if these three men were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves
 or if i send disease into that land letting loose my wrath on it in blood cutting off from it man and beast
 even if noah daniel and job were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep son or daughter safe only themselves would they keep safe through their righteousness
 for this is what the lord has said how much more when i send my four bitter punishments on jerusalem the sword and need of food and evil beasts and disease cutting off from it man and beast
 but truly there will still be a small band who will be safe even sons and daughters and they will come out to you and you will see their ways and their doings and you will be comforted about the evil which i have sent on jerusalem even about everything i have sent on it
 they will give you comfort when you see their ways and their doings and you will be certain that not for nothing have i done all the things i have done in it says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man what is the vine tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods
 will its wood be used for any work do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on
 see it is put into the fire for burning the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned is it good for any work
 truly before it was cut down it was not used for any purpose how much less when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned will it be made into anything
 for this cause the lord has said like the vine tree among the trees of the woods which i have given to the fire for burning so will i give the people of jerusalem
 and my face will be turned against them and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it and it will be clear to you that i am the lord when my face is turned against them
 and i will make the land a waste because they have done evil says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make clear to jerusalem her disgusting ways
 and say this is what the lord has said to jerusalem your start and your birth was from the land of the canaanite an amorite was your father and your mother was a hittite
 as for your birth on the day of your birth your cord was not cut and you were not washed in water to make you clean you were not salted or folded in linen bands
 no eye had pity on you to do any of these things to you or to be kind to you but you were put out into the open country because your life was hated at the time of your birth
 and when i went past you and saw you stretched out in your blood i said to you though you are stretched out in your blood have life
 and be increased in number like the buds of the field and you were increased and became great and you came to the time of love your breasts were formed and your hair was long but you were uncovered and without clothing
 now when i went past you looking at you i saw that your time was the time of love and i put my skirts over you covering your unclothed body and i gave you my oath and made an agreement with you says the lord and you became mine
 then i had you washed with water washing away all your blood and rubbing you with oil
 and i had you clothed with needlework and put leather shoes on your feet folding fair linen about you and covering you with silk
 and i made you fair with ornaments and put jewels on your hands and a chain on your neck
 and i put a ring in your nose and ear rings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head
 so you were made beautiful with gold and silver and your clothing was of the best linen and silk and needlework your food was the best meal and honey and oil and you were very beautiful
