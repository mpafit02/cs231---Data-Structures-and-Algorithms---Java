 and he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who himself gave his word to david my father and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
 from the day when i took my people israel out of egypt no town in all the tribes of israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting place of my name but i made selection of david to be king over my people israel
 now it was in the heart of david my father to put up a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 but the lord said to david my father you did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
 but you yourself will not be the builder of my house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
 and the lord has made his word come true for i have taken my father davids place on the seat of the kingdom of israel as the lord gave his word and i have made a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 in it i have made a place for the ark in which is the agreement which the lord made with our fathers when he took them out of the land of egypt
 then solomon took his place before the altar of the lord all the men of israel being present and stretching out his hands to heaven
 said o lord the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on the earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
 and you have kept the word which you gave to your servant david my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
 so now o lord the god of israel let your word to your servant david my father come true when you said you will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of israel before me if only your children give attention to their ways walking before me as you have done
 so now o god of israel it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant david my father
 but is it truly possible that god may be housed on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting place how much less this house which i have made 
 still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant o lord god and to his prayer for grace give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day
 that your eyes may be open to this house night and day to this place of which you have said my name will be there hearing the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
 give ear to the prayers of your servant and the prayers of your people israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear in heaven your living place and hearing have mercy
 if a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
 then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving your decision against the wrongdoer so that punishment for his sins may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
 when your people israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house
 then give ear in heaven and let the sin of your people israel have forgiveness and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers
 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
 then give ear in heaven so that the sin of your servants and of your people israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
 if there is no food in the land or if there is disease or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble whatever disease there may be
 whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
 give ear in heaven your living place acting in mercy and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men
 so that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers
 and as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people israel when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name
  for they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out stretched arm  when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
 give ear in heaven your living place and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people israel and that they may see that this house which i have put up is truly named by your name
 if your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayer to the lord turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which i have made for your name
