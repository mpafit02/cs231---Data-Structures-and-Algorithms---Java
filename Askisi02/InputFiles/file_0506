 with the work of a jeweller like the cutting of a stamp the names of the children of israel are to be cut on them and they are to be fixed in twisted frames of gold
 and the two stones are to be placed on the ephod over the arm holes to be stones of memory for the children of israel aaron will have their names on his arms when he goes in before the lord to keep the lord in mind of them
 and you are to make twisted frames of gold
 and two chains of the best gold twisted like cords and have the chains fixed on to the frames
 and make a priests bag for giving decisions designed like the ephod made of gold and blue and purple and red and the best linen
 it is to be square folded in two a hand stretch long and a hand stretch wide
 and on it you are to put four lines of jewels the first line is to be a cornelian a chrysolite and an emerald
 the second a ruby a sapphire and an onyx
 the third a jacinth an agate and an amethyst
 the fourth a topaz a beryl and a jasper they are to be fixed in twisted frames of gold
 the jewels are to be twelve in number for the names of the children of israel every jewel having the name of one of the twelve tribes cut on it as on a stamp
 and you are to make two chains of gold twisted like cords to be fixed to the priests bag
 and put two gold rings on the two ends of the bag
 put the two gold chains on the two rings at the ends of the bag
 joining the other ends of the chains to the gold frames and putting them on the front of the ephod at the top of the arms
 then make two gold rings and put them on the lower ends of the bag at the edge of it on the inner side nearest to the ephod
 and make two more gold rings and put them on the front of the ephod at the top of the arms at the join over the worked band
 so that the rings on the bag may be fixed to the rings of the ephod by a blue cord and on to the band of the ephod so that the bag may not come loose from the ephod
 and so aaron will have the names of the children of israel on the priests bag over his heart whenever he goes into the holy place to keep the memory of them before the lord
 and in the bag you are to put the urim and thummim so that they may be on aarons heart whenever he goes in before the lord and aaron may have the power of making decisions for the children of israel before the lord at all times
 the robe which goes with the ephod is to be made all of blue
 with a hole at the top in the middle of it the hole is to be edged with a band to make it strong like the hole in the coat of a fighting man so that it may not be broken open
 and round the skirts of it put fruits in blue and purple and red with bells of gold between
 a gold bell and a fruit in turn all round the skirts of the robe
 aaron is to put it on for his holy work and the sound of it will be clear when he goes into the holy place before the lord and when he comes out keeping him safe from death
 you are to make a plate of the best gold cutting on it as on a stamp these words holy to the lord
 put a blue cord on it and put it on the front of the twisted head dress
 and it will be over aarons brow so that aaron will be responsible for any error in all the holy offerings made by the children of israel it will be on his brow at all times so that their offerings may be pleasing to the lord
