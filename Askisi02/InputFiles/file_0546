 all the people of the sea lands are overcome with wonder at you and their kings are full of fear their faces are troubled
 those who do business among the peoples make sounds of surprise at you you have become a thing of fear you have come to an end for ever
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man say to the ruler of tyre this is what the lord has said because your heart has been lifted up and you have said i am a god i am seated on the seat of god in the heart of the seas but you are man and not god though you have made your heart as the heart of god
 see you are wiser than daniel there is no secret which is deeper than your knowledge
 by your wisdom and deep knowledge you have got power for yourself and put silver and gold in your store houses
 by your great wisdom and by your trade your power is increased and your heart is lifted up because of your power
 for this cause the lord has said because you have made your heart as the heart of god
 see i am sending against you strange men feared among the nations they will let loose their swords against your bright wisdom they will make your glory a common thing
 they will send you down to the underworld and your death will be the death of those who are put to the sword in the heart of the seas
 will you say in the face of those who are taking your life i am god but you are man and not god in the hands of those who are wounding you
 your death will be the death of those who are without circumcision by the hands of men from strange lands for i have said it says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make a song of grief for the king of tyre and say to him this is what the lord has said you are all wise and completely beautiful
 you were in eden the garden of god every stone of great price was your clothing the sardius the topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the emerald and the carbuncle your store houses were full of gold and things of great price were in you in the day when you were made they were got ready
 i gave you your place with the winged one i put you on the mountain of god you went up and down among the stones of fire
 there has been no evil in your ways from the day when you were made till sin was seen in you
 through all your trading you have become full of violent ways and have done evil so i sent you out shamed from the mountain of god the winged one put an end to you from among the stones of fire
 your heart was lifted up because you were beautiful you made your wisdom evil through your sin i have sent you down even to the earth i have made you low before kings so that they may see you
 by all your sin even by your evil trading you have made your holy places unclean so i will make a fire come out from you it will make a meal of you and i will make you as dust on the earth before the eyes of all who see you
 all who have knowledge of you among the peoples will be overcome with wonder at you you have become a thing of fear and you will never be seen again
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to zidon and be a prophet against it and say
 these are the words of the lord see i am against you o zidon and i will get glory for myself in you and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send my punishments on her and i will be seen to be holy in her
 and i will send on her disease and blood in her streets and the wounded will be falling in the middle of her and the sword will be against her on every side and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and there will no longer be a plant with sharp points wounding the children of israel or a thorn troubling them among any who are round about them who put shame on them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said when i have got together the children of israel from the peoples among whom they are wandering and have been made holy among them before the eyes of the nations then they will have rest in the land which is theirs which i gave to my servant jacob
 and they will be safe there building houses and planting vine gardens and living without fear when i have sent my punishments on all those who put shame on them round about them and they will be certain that i am the lord their god
 in the tenth year in the tenth month on the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned against pharaoh king of egypt and be a prophet against him and against all egypt
