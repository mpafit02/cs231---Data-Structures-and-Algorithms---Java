 o lord take me out of the hands of sinners keep me safe from the violent man for they are designing my downfall
 the men of pride have put secret cords for my feet stretching nets in my way so that they may take me with their tricks  selah 
 i have said to the lord you are my god give ear o lord to the voice of my prayer
 o lord god the strength of my salvation you have been a cover over my head in the day of the fight
 o lord give not the wrongdoer his desire give him no help in his evil designs or he may be uplifted in pride  selah 
 as for those who come round me let their heads be covered by the evil of their lips
 let burning flames come down on them let them be put into the fire and into deep waters so that they may not get up again
 let not a man of evil tongue be safe on earth let destruction overtake the violent man with blow on blow
 i am certain that the lord will take care of the cause of the poor and of the rights of those who are troubled
 truly the upright will give praise to your name the holy will have a place in your house
 &lta psalm of david&gt lord i have made my cry to you come to me quickly give ear to my voice when it goes up to you
 let my prayer be ordered before you like a sweet smell and let the lifting up of my hands be like the evening offering
 o lord keep a watch over my mouth keep the door of my lips
 keep my heart from desiring any evil thing or from taking part in the sins of the evil doers with men who do wrong and let me have no part in their good things
 let the upright give me punishment and let the god fearing man put me in the right way but i will not let the oil of sinners come on my head when they do evil i will give myself to prayer
 when destruction comes to their judges by the side of the rock they will give ear to my words for they are sweet
 our bones are broken up at the mouth of the underworld as the earth is broken by the plough
 but my eyes are turned to you o lord god my hope is in you let not my soul be given up to death
 keep me from the net which they have put down for me and from the designs of the workers of evil
 let the sinners be taken in the nets which they themselves have put down while i go free
 &ltmaschil of david a prayer when he was in the hole of the rock&gt the sound of my cry went up to the lord with my voice i made my prayer for grace to the lord
 i put all my sorrows before him and made clear to him all my trouble
 when my spirit is overcome your eyes are on my goings nets have been secretly placed in the way in which i go
 looking to my right side i saw no man who was my friend i had no safe place no one had any care for my soul
 i have made my cry to you o lord i have said you are my safe place and my heritage in the land of the living
 give ear to my cry for i am made very low take me out of the hands of my haters for they are stronger than i
 take my soul out of prison so that i may give praise to your name the upright will give praise because of me for you have given me a full reward
 &lta psalm of david&gt let my prayer come to you o lord give ear to my requests for your grace keep faith with me and give me an answer in your righteousness
 let not your servant come before you to be judged for no man living is upright in your eyes
 the evil man has gone after my soul my life is crushed down to the earth he has put me in the dark like those who have long been dead
