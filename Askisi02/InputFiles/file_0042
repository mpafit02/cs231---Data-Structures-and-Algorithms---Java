 so then my child be strong in the grace which is in christ jesus
 and the things which i have said to you before a number of witnesses give to those of the faith so that they may be teachers of others
 be ready to do without the comforts of life as one of the army of christ jesus
 a fighting man when he is with the army keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army
 and if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules
 it is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit
 give thought to what i say for the lord will give you wisdom in all things
 keep in mind jesus christ of the seed of david who came back from the dead as my good news gives witness
 in which i put up with the hardest conditions even prison chains like one who has done a crime but the word of god is not in chains
 but i undergo all things for the saints so that they may have salvation in christ jesus with eternal glory
 this is a true saying if we undergo death with him then will we be living with him
 if we go on to the end then we will be ruling with him if we say we have no knowledge of him then he will say he has no knowledge of us
 if we are without faith still he keeps faith for he will never be untrue to himself
 put these things before them giving them orders in the name of the lord to keep themselves from fighting about words which is of no profit only causing error in their hearers
 let it be your care to get the approval of god as a workman who has no cause for shame giving the true word in the right way
 but take no part in wrong and foolish talk for those who do so will go farther into evil
 and their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh such are hymenaeus and philetus
 men whose ideas are all false who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place overturning the faith of some
 but gods strong base is unchanging having this sign the lord has knowledge of those who are his and let everyone by whom the name of the lord is named be turned away from evil
 now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but others of wood and earth and some which are honoured and some without honour
 if a man makes himself clean from these he will be a vessel for honour made holy ready for the masters use ready for every good work
 but keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young and go after righteousness faith love peace with those whose prayers go up to the lord from a clean heart
 and put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings seeing that they are a cause of trouble
 for it is not right for the lords servant to make trouble but he is to be gentle to all ready in teaching putting up with wrong
 gently guiding those who go against the teaching if by chance god may give them a change of heart and true knowledge
 and so they may get themselves free from the net of the evil one being made the prisoners of the lords servant for the purpose of god
 but be certain of this that in the last days times of trouble will come
 for men will be lovers of self lovers of money uplifted in pride given to bitter words going against the authority of their fathers never giving praise having no religion
 without natural love bitter haters saying evil of others violent and uncontrolled hating all good
 false to their friends acting without thought lifted up in mind loving pleasure more than god
