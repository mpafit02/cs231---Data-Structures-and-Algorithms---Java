 get for yourself that which is true and do not let it go for money get wisdom and teaching and good sense
 the father of the upright man will be glad and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him
 let your father and your mother be glad let her who gave you birth have joy
 my son give me your heart and let your eyes take delight in my ways
 for a loose woman is a deep hollow and a strange woman is a narrow water hole
 yes she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food and deceit by her is increased among men
 who says oh  who says ah  who has violent arguments who has grief who has wounds without cause whose eyes are dark
 those who are seated late over the wine those who go looking for mixed wine
 keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red when its colour is bright in the cup when it goes smoothly down
 in the end its bite is like that of a snake its wound like the wound of a poison snake
 your eyes will see strange things and you will say twisted things
 yes you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea or on the top of a sail support
 they have overcome me you will say and i have no pain they gave me blows without my feeling them when will i be awake from my wine i will go after it again
 have no envy for evil men or any desire to be with them
 for the purposes of their hearts are destruction and their lips are talking of trouble
 the building of a house is by wisdom and by reason it is made strong
 and by knowledge its rooms are full of all dear and pleasing things
 a wise man is strong and a man of knowledge makes strength greater
 for by wise guiding you will overcome in war and in a number of wise guides there is salvation
 wisdom is outside the power of the foolish he keeps his mouth shut in the public place
 he whose purposes are bad will be named a man of evil designs
 the purpose of the foolish is sin and the hater of authority is disgusting to others
 if you give way in the day of trouble your strength is small
 be the saviour of those who are given up to death and do not keep back help from those who are slipping to destruction
 if you say see we had no knowledge of this does not the tester of hearts give thought to it and he who keeps your soul has he no knowledge of it and will he not give to every man the reward of his work
 my son take honey for it is good and the flowing honey which is sweet to your taste
 so let your desire be for wisdom if you have it there will be a future and your hope will not be cut off
 do not keep a secret watch o evil doer against the fields of the upright man or send destruction on his resting place
 for an upright man after falling seven times will get up again but trouble is the downfall of the evil
 do not be glad at the fall of your hater and let not your heart have joy at his downfall
