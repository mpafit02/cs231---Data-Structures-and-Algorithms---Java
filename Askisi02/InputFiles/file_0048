 and when he became clear about this he went to the house of mary the mother of john named mark where a number of them had come together for prayer
 and he gave a blow on the door and a young girl came to it named rhoda
 and hearing the voice of peter in her joy she went running without opening the door to say that peter was outside
 and they said to her you are off your head but still she said with decision that it was so and they said it is his angel
 but peter went on giving blows on the door and when it was open and they saw him they were full of wonder
 but he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet and gave them an account of how the lord had taken him out of prison and he said give the news to james and the brothers and then he went away
 now when it was day the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of peter
 and herod when he sent for him and he was not there after questioning the watchmen gave orders that they were to be put to death then he went down from judaea to caesarea for a time
 now he was very angry with the people of tyre and sidon and they came to him all together and having made friends with blastus the controller of the kings house they made a request for peace because their country was dependent on the kings country for its food
 and on the day which had been fixed herod dressed in his robes and seated in his place made a public statement to them
 and the people with loud cries said it is the voice of a god not of a man
 and straight away the angel of the lord sent a disease on him because he did not give the glory to god and his flesh was wasted away by worms and so he came to his end
 but the word of the lord went on increasing
 and barnabas and saul came back from jerusalem when their work was ended taking with them john named mark
 now there were at antioch in the church there prophets and teachers barnabas and symeon who was named niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen a relation of herod the king and saul
 and while they were doing the lords work and going without food the holy spirit said let barnabas and saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me
 then after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them and sent them away
 so being sent out by the holy spirit they went down to seleucia and from there they went by ship to cyprus
 and at salamis they were preaching the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and john was with them helping them
 and when they had gone through all the island to paphos they came across a certain wonder worker and false prophet a jew whose name was bar jesus
 who was with the ruler sergius paulus an able man this man sent for barnabas and saul desiring to have knowledge of the word of god
 but elymas the wonder worker  for that is the sense of his name  put himself against them with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith
 but saul whose other name is paul being full of the holy spirit looking hard at him said
 o you who are full of false tricks and evil ways a son of the evil one hating all righteousness will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the lord
 and now see the hand of the lord is on you and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time and straight away a dark mist came down on him and he went about looking for a guide
 then the ruler when he saw what was done had faith being full of wonder at the teaching of the lord
 then paul and those who were with him went by ship from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia and there john went away from them and came back to jerusalem
 but they going through from perga came to antioch in pisidia and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath and were seated
 and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them saying brothers if you have a word of comfort for the people say on
 and paul getting up and making a sign with his hand said men of israel and you who have the fear of god give ear
