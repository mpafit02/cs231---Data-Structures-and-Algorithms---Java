 still i will be glad in the lord my joy will be in the god of my salvation
 the lord god is my strength and he makes my feet like roes feet guiding me on my high places for the chief music maker on corded instruments
 in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month on the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel ruler of judah and to joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest saying

 go up to the hills and get wood and put up the house and i will take pleasure in it and be honoured says the lord
 you were looking for much and it came to little and when you got it into your house i took it away with a breath why says the lord of armies because of my house which is a waste while every man takes care of the house which is his
 for this cause the heaven over you is kept from giving dew and the earth from giving her fruit
 and by my order no rain came on the land or on the mountains or the grain or the wine or the oil or the produce of the earth or on men or cattle or on any work of mans hands
 then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and all the rest of the people gave ear to the voice of the lord their god and to the words of haggai the prophet because the lord their god had sent him and the people were in fear before the lord
 then haggai whom the lord had sent to give his words to the people said i am with you says the lord
 and the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel ruler of judah was moved by the lord as was the spirit of joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of armies their god
 on the twenty fourth day of the month in the sixth month in the second year of darius the king
 in the seventh month on the twenty first day of the month the word of the lord came by haggai the prophet saying

 who is there still among you who saw this house in its first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes as nothing
 but now be strong o zerubbabel says the lord and be strong o joshua son of jehozadak the high priest and be strong all you people of the land says the lord and get to work for i am with you says the lord of armies
 the agreement which i made with you when you came out of egypt and my spirit are with you still have no fear
 for this is what the lord of armies has said in a short time i will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
 and i will make a shaking of all the nations and the desired things of all nations will come and i will make this house full of my glory says the lord of armies
 the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of armies
 the second glory of this house will be greater than the first says the lord of armies and in this place i will give peace says the lord of armies

 these are the words of the lord of armies put now a point of law to the priests saying
 if anyone has some holy flesh folded in the skirt of his robe will bread or soup or wine or oil or any other food be made holy if touched by his skirt and the priests answering said no
 then haggai said will any of these be made unclean by the touch of one who is unclean through touching a dead body and the priests answering said it will be made unclean
