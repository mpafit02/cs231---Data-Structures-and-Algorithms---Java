 do no damage to the earth or the sea or the trees till we have put a mark on the servants of our god
 and there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows a hundred and forty four thousand who were marked out of every tribe of the people of israel
 of the tribe of judah were marked twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben twelve thousand of the tribe of gad twelve thousand
 of the tribe of asher twelve thousand of the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand
 of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand of the tribe of levi twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar twelve thousand
 of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were marked twelve thousand
 after these things i saw a great army of people more than might be numbered out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages taking their places before the high seat and before the lamb dressed in white robes and with branches in their hands
 saying with a loud voice salvation to our god who is seated on the high seat and to the lamb
 and all the angels were round about the high seat and about the rulers and the four beasts and they went down on their faces before the high seat and gave worship to god saying
 so be it let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our god for ever and ever so be it
 and one of the rulers made answer saying to me these who have on white robes who are they and where did they come from
 and i said to him my lord you have knowledge and he said to me these are they who came through the great testing and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the lamb
 this is why they are before the high seat of god and they are his servants day and night in his house and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them
 they will never be in need of food or drink and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun
 for the lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water and god will make glad their eyes for ever
 and when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour
 and i saw the seven angels who had their place before god and seven horns were given to them
 and another angel came and took his place at the altar having a gold vessel for burning perfume and there was given to him much perfume so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat
 and the smoke of the perfume with the prayers of the saints went up before god out of the angels hand
 and the angel took the vessel and he made it full of the fire of the altar and sent it down on the earth and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth
 and the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them
 and at the sounding of the first a rain of ice and fire mixed with blood was sent on the earth and a third part of the earth and of the trees and all green grass was burned up
 and at the sounding of the second angel it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea and a third part of the sea became blood
 and destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea and on a third part of the ships
 and at the sounding of the third angel there went down from heaven a great star burning like a flame and it came on a third part of the rivers and on the fountains of water
 and the name of the star is wormwood and a third part of the waters became bitter and a number of men came to their end because of the waters for they were made bitter
 and at the sounding of the fourth angel a third part of the sun and of the moon and of the stars was made dark so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night
 and there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven saying with a great voice trouble trouble trouble to all on the earth because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels whose sounding is still to come
 and at the sounding of the fifth angel i saw a star falling from heaven to the earth and there was given to him the key of the great deep
 and he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it like the smoke of a great oven and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke
