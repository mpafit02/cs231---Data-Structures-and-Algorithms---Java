 having a form of religion but turning their backs on the power of it go not with these
 for these are they who go secretly into houses making prisoners of foolish women weighted down with sin turned from the way by their evil desires
 ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of what is true
 and as james and jambres went against moses so do these go against what is true men of evil minds who tested by faith are seen to be false
 but they will go no farther for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men as theirs was in the end
 but you took as your example my teaching behaviour purpose and faith my long waiting my love my quiet undergoing of trouble
 my punishments and pain the things which came to me at antioch at iconium at lystra the cruel attacks made on me and the lord made me free from them all
 yes and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of god in christ jesus will be cruelly attacked
 evil and false men will become worse and worse using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit
 but see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain conscious of who has been your teacher
 and that from the time when you were a child you have had knowledge of the holy writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in christ jesus
 every holy writing which comes from god is of profit for teaching for training for guiding for education in righteousness
 so that the man of god may be complete trained and made ready for every good work
 i give you orders before god and christ jesus who will be the judge of the living and the dead and by his revelation and his kingdom
 be preaching the word at all times in every place make protests say sharp words give comfort with long waiting and teaching
 for the time will come when they will not take the true teaching but moved by their desires they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them
 and shutting their ears to what is true will be turned away to belief in foolish stories
 but be self controlled in all things do without comfort go on preaching the good news completing the work which has been given you to do
 for i am even now being offered and my end is near
 i have made a good fight i have come to the end of my journey i have kept the faith
 from now on the crown of righteousness is made ready for me which the lord the upright judge will give to me at that day and not only to me but to all those who have had love for his revelation
 do your best to come to me before long
 for demas has gone away from me for love of this present life and has gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia
 only luke is with me get mark and take him with you for he is of use to me in the work
 tychicus i sent to ephesus
 the coat which i did not take from troas and which is with carpus get when you come and the books specially the papers
 alexander the copper worker did me much wrong the lord will give him the reward of his works
 but be on the watch for him for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching
 at my first meeting with my judges no one took my part but all went away from me may it not be put to their account
 but the lord was by my side and gave me strength so that through me the news might be given out in full measure and all the gentiles might give ear and i was taken out of the mouth of the lion
