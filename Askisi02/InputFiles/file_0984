 even if he has a fall he will not be without help for the hand of the lord is supporting him
 i have been young and now am old but i have not seen the good man without help or his children looking for bread
 all the day he is ready to have mercy and to give his children are a blessing
 be turned from evil and do good and your place will be for ever
 for the lord is a lover of righteousness and takes care of his saints they will be kept safe for ever but the seed of the evil doers will be cut off
 the upright will have the earth for their heritage and will go on living there for ever
 the mouth of the good man says words of wisdom the talk of his tongue is of righteousness
 the law of his god is in his heart he will never make a false step
 the sinners are watching the upright man desiring to put him to death
 the lord will not give him into their hands or be against him when he is judged
 be waiting for the lord and keep his way and you will be lifted up and have the land for your heritage when the evil doers are cut off you will see it
 i have seen the evil doer in great power covering the earth like a great tree
 but he came to an end and there was no sign of him i made a search for him and he was not there
 give attention to the good man and take note of the upright because the end of that man is peace
 but as for the sinners they will be cut off together the end of the wrongdoers is destruction
 but the lord is the saviour of the upright he is their strength in the time of trouble
 and the lord will be their help and keep them safe he will take them out of the hands of the evil doers and be their saviour because they had faith in him
 &lta psalm of david to keep in memory&gt o lord be not bitter with me in your wrath let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion
 for your arrows have gone into my flesh and i am crushed under the weight of your hand
 my flesh is wasted because of your wrath and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin
 for my crimes have gone over my head they are like a great weight which is more than my strength
 my wounds are poisoned and evil smelling because of my foolish behaviour
 i am troubled i am made low i go weeping all the day
 for my body is full of burning all my flesh is unhealthy
 i am feeble and crushed down i gave a cry like a lion because of the grief in my heart
 lord all my desire is before you my sorrow is not kept secret from you
 my heart goes out in pain my strength is wasting away as for the light of my eyes it is gone from me
 my lovers and my friends keep away from my disease my relations keep far away
 those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me all the day their minds are full of deceit
 but i kept my ears shut like a man without hearing like a man without a voice never opening his mouth
