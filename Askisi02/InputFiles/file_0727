 i took note and gave ear but no one said what is right no man had regret for his evil doing saying what have i done everyone goes off on his way like a horse rushing to the fight
 truly the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming but my people have no knowledge of the law of the lord
 how is it that you say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us but see the false pen of the scribes has made it false
 the wise men are shamed they are overcome with fear and taken see they have given up the word of the lord and what use is their wisdom to them
 so i will give their wives to others and their fields to those who will take them for themselves for everyone from the least to the greatest is given up to getting money from the priest even to the prophet everyone is false
 and they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of zion saying peace peace when there is no peace
 let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things they had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling in the time of their punishment they will be made low says the lord
 i will put an end to them completely says the lord there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree and the leaf is dry
 why are we seated doing nothing come together and let us go to the walled towns and let destruction overtake us there for the lord our god has sent destruction on us and given us bitter water for our drink because we have done evil against the lord
 we were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of well being but there is only a great fear
 the loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from dan at the sound of the outcry of his war horses all the land is shaking with fear for they have come and have made a meal of the land and everything in it the town and the people living in it
 see i will send snakes and poison snakes among you against which the wonder worker has no power and they will give you wounds which may not be made well says the lord
 sorrow has come on me  my heart in me is feeble
 the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land is the lord not in zion is not her king in her why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods
 the grain cutting is past the summer is ended and no salvation has come to us
 for the destruction of the daughter of my people i am broken i am dressed in the clothing of grief fear has taken me in its grip
 is there no life giving oil in gilead is there no expert in medical arts why then have my people not been made well
 if only my head was a stream of waters and my eyes fountains of weeping so that i might go on weeping day and night for the dead of the daughter of my people 
 if only i had in the waste land a nights resting place for travellers so that i might go away far from my people  for they are all untrue a band of false men
 their tongues are bent like a bow to send out false words they have become strong in the land but not for good faith they go on from evil to evil and they have no knowledge of me says the lord
 let everyone keep watch on his neighbour and put no faith in any brother for every brother will certainly be tricking his brother and every neighbour will go about saying evil
 everyone will make sport of his neighbour with deceit not saying what is true their tongues have been trained to say false words they are twisted hating to come back
 there is wrong on wrong deceit on deceit they have given up the knowledge of me says the lord
 so the lord of armies has said see i will make them soft in the fire and put them to the test this i will do because of their evil doing
 his tongue is an arrow causing death the words of his mouth are deceit he says words of peace to his neighbour but in his heart he is waiting secretly for him
 am i not to send punishment for these things says the lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
 give yourselves to weeping crying out in sorrow for the mountains and for the fields of the waste land send up a song of grief because they are burned up so that no one goes through there is no sound of cattle the bird of the heavens and the beast are in flight and are gone
 and i will make jerusalem a mass of broken stones the living place of jackals and i will make the towns of judah a waste with no man living there
 who is the wise man able to see this who is he to whom the word of the lord has come so that he may make it clear why is the land given to destruction and burned up like a waste place so that no one goes through
 and the lord said because they have given up my law which i put before them giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it
