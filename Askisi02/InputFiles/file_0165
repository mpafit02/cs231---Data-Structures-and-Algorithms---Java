 for he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him at the number of fish which they had taken
 and so were james and john the sons of zebedee who were working with simon and jesus said to simon have no fear from this time forward you will be a fisher of men
 and when they had got their boats to the land they gave up everything and went after him
 and it came about that while he was in one of the towns there was a leper there and when he saw jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him saying lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
 and he put out his hand to him and said it is my pleasure be clean and straight away his disease went from him
 and he gave him orders say nothing to any man but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean as the law of moses says and for a witness to them
 but news of him went out all the more in every direction and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases
 but he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer
 and it came about that on one of these days he was teaching and some pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there who had come from every town of galilee and judaea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to make those who were ill free from their diseases
 and some men had with them on a bed a man who was ill without power of moving and they made attempts to get him in and put him before jesus
 and because of the mass of people there was no way to get him in so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof on his bed into the middle in front of jesus
 and seeing their faith he said man you have forgiveness for your sins
 and the scribes and pharisees were having an argument saying who is this who has no respect for god who is able to give forgiveness for sins but god only
 but jesus who had knowledge of their thoughts said to them why are you reasoning in your hearts
 which is the simpler to say you have forgiveness for your sins or to say get up and go
 but so that you may see that on earth the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins  he said to the man who was ill  i say to you get up and take up your bed and go into your house
 and straight away he got up before them and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to god
 and wonder overcame them all and they gave glory to god and they were full of fear saying we have seen strange things today
 and after these things he went out and saw levi a tax farmer seated at the place where taxes were taken and said to him come after me
 and giving up his business he got up and went after him
 and levi made a great feast for him in his house and a great number of tax farmers and others were seated at table with them
 and the pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples saying why do you take food and drink with tax farmers and sinners
 and jesus answering said to them those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
 i have come not to get the upright but sinners so that they may be turned from their sins
 and they said to him the disciples of john frequently go without food and make prayers and so do the disciples of the pharisees but your disciples take food and drink
 and jesus said are you able to make the friends of the newly married man go without food when he is with them
 but the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
 and he said to them in a story no man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old
 and no man puts new wine into old wine skins for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine and the wine be let out and the skins come to destruction
 but new wine has to be put into new wine skins
