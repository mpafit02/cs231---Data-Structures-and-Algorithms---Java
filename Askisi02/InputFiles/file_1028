 on the twenty fourth day of the eleventh month the month shebat in the second year of darius the word of the lord came to zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
 i saw in the night a man on a red horse between the mountains in the valley and at his back were horses red black white and of mixed colours
 then i said o my lord what are these and the angel who was talking to me said to me i will make clear to you what they are
 and the man who was between the mountains answering me said these are those whom the lord has sent to go up and down through the earth
 and the man who was between the mountains answering said to the angel of the lord we have gone up and down through the earth and all the earth is quiet and at rest
 then the angel of the lord answering said o lord of armies how long will it be before you have mercy on jerusalem and on the towns of judah against which your wrath has been burning for seventy years
 and the lord gave an answer in good and comforting words to the angel who was talking to me
 and the angel who was talking to me said to me let your voice be loud and say these are the words of the lord of armies i am greatly moved about the fate of jerusalem and of zion
 and i am very angry with the nations who are living untroubled for when i was only a little angry they made the evil worse
 so this is what the lord has said i have come back to jerusalem with mercies my house is to be put up in her says the lord of armies and a line is to be stretched out over jerusalem
 and again let your voice be loud and say this is what the lord of armies has said my towns will again be overflowing with good things and again the lord will give comfort to zion and take jerusalem for himself
 and lifting up my eyes i saw four horns
 and i said to the angel who was talking to me what are these and he said to me these are the horns which have sent judah israel and jerusalem in flight
 and the lord gave me a vision of four metal workers
 then i said what have these come to do and he said these are the horns which sent judah in flight and kept him from lifting up his head but these men have come to send fear on them and to put down the nations who are lifting up their horns against the land of judah to send it in flight
 make your request to the lord for rain in the time of the spring rains even to the lord who makes the thunder flames and he will give them showers of rain to every man grass in the field
 for the images have said what is not true and the readers of signs have seen deceit they have given accounts of false dreams they give comfort to no purpose so they go out of the way like sheep they are troubled because they have no keeper
 my wrath is burning against the keepers of the flock and i will send punishment on the he goats for the lord of armies takes care of his flock the people of judah and will make them like the horse of his pride in the fight
 from him will come the keystone from him the nail from him the bow of war from him will come every ruler
 together they will be like men of war crushing down their haters into the earth of the streets in the fight they will make war because the lord is with them and the horsemen will be shamed
 and i will make the children of judah strong and i will be the saviour of the children of joseph and i will make them come back again for i have had mercy on them they will be as if i had not given them up for i am the lord their god and i will give them an answer
 and ephraim will be like a man of war and their hearts will be glad as with wine and their children will see it with joy their hearts will be glad in the lord
 with the sound of the pipe i will get them together for i have given the price to make them free and they will be increased as they were increased
 though i had them planted among the peoples they will keep me in mind in far countries and they will take care of their children and will come back
 and i will make them come back out of the land of egypt and will get them together out of assyria and i will take them into the land of gilead and it will not be wide enough for them
 and they will go through the sea of egypt and all the deep waters of the nile will become dry and the pride of assyria will be made low and the power of egypt will be taken away
 and their strength will be in the lord and their pride will be in his name says the lord
 let your doors be open o lebanon so that fire may be burning among your cedars
 give a cry of grief o fir tree for the fall of the cedar because the great ones have been made low give cries of grief o you oaks of bashan for the strong trees of the wood have come down
 the sound of the crying of the keepers of the flock  for their glory is made waste the sound of the loud crying of the young lions  for the pride of jordan is made waste
