 and a man of benjamin went running from the fight and came to shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head
 and when he came eli was seated by the wayside watching and in his heart was fear for the ark of god and when the man came into the town and gave the news there was a great outcry
 and eli hearing the noise and the cries said what is the reason of this outcry and the man came quickly and gave the news to eli
 now eli was ninety eight years old and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see
 and the man said to eli i have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight and he said how did it go my son
 and the man said israel went in flight from the philistines and there has been great destruction among the people and your two sons hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god has been taken
 and at these words about the ark of god eli falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him for he was an old man and of great weight he had been judging israel for forty years
 and his daughter in law the wife of phinehas was with child and near the time when she would give birth and when she had the news that the ark of god had been taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth
 and when she was very near death the women who were with her said have no fear for you have given birth to a son but she made no answer and gave no attention to it
 and she gave the child the name of ichabod saying the glory has gone from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband
 and she said the glory is gone from israel for the ark of god has been taken
 now the philistines having taken the ark of god took it with them from eben ezer to ashdod
 they took the ark of god into the house of dagon and put it by the side of dagon
 and when the people of ashdod got up early on the morning after they saw that dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the lord and they took dagon up and put him in his place again
 and when they got up early on the morning after dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the lord and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep only the base was in its place
 so to this day no priest of dagon or any who come into dagons house will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of dagon in ashdod
 but the hand of the lord was hard on the people of ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of ashdod
 and when the men of ashdod saw how it was they said let not the ark of the god of israel be with us for his hand is hard on us and on dagon our god
 so they sent for all the lords of the philistines to come together there and said what are we to do with the ark of the god of israel and their answer was let the ark of the god of israel be taken away to gath so they took the ark of the god of israel away
 but after they had taken it away the hand of the lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town small and great
 so they sent the ark of god to ekron and when the ark of god came to ekron the people of the town made an outcry saying they have sent the ark of the god of israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people
 so they sent and got together all the lords of the philistines and they said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go back to its place so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people for there was a great fear of death through all the town the hand of god was very hard on them there
 and those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased and the cry of the town went up to heaven
 now the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines for seven months
 and the philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts and said to them what are we to do with the ark of the lord how are we to send it away to its place
 and they said if you send away the ark of the god of israel do not send it without an offering but send him a sin offering with it then you will have peace again and it will be clear to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you
 then they said what sin offering are we to send to him and they said five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice one for every lord of the philistines for the same disease came on you and on your lords
 so make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land and give glory to the god of israel it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land
 why do you make your hearts hard like the hearts of pharaoh and the egyptians when he had made sport of them did they not let the people go and they went away
 so now take and make ready a new cart and two cows which have never come under the yoke and have the cows yoked to the cart and take their young ones away from them
