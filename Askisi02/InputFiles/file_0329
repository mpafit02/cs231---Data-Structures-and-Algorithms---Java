 then saul said to jonathan give me an account of what you have done and jonathan gave him the story and said certainly i took a little honey on the end of my rod and now death is to be my fate
 and saul said may gods punishment be on me if death is not your fate jonathan
 and the people said to saul is death to come to jonathan the worker of this great salvation for israel let it not be so by the living lord not one hair of his head is to be touched for he has been working with god today so the people kept jonathan from death
 then saul turning back went after the philistines no longer and the philistines went back to their place
 now when saul had taken his place as ruler of israel he made war on those who were against him on every side moab and the ammonites and edom and the kings of zobah and the philistines and whichever way he went he overcame them
 and he did great things and overcame the amalekites and made israel safe from the hands of their attackers
 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishvi and malchi shua and these are the names of his daughters the older was named merab and the younger michal
 the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz the captain of his army was abner the son of ner brother of sauls father
 kish the father of saul and ner the father of abner were sons of abiel
 all through the life of saul there was bitter war against the philistines and whenever saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man he kept him near himself
 and samuel said to saul the lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king over his people over israel so give ear now to the words of the lord
 the lord of armies says i will give punishment to amalek for what he did to israel fighting against him on the way when israel came out of egypt
 go now and put amalek to the sword putting to the curse all they have without mercy put to death every man and woman every child and baby at the breast every ox and sheep camel and ass
 and saul sent for the people and had them numbered in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah
 and saul came to the town of amalek and took up his position in the valley secretly
 and saul said to the kenites go away take yourselves out from among the amalekites or destruction will overtake you with them for you were kind to the children of israel when they came out of egypt so the kenites went away from among the amalekites
 and saul made an attack on the amalekites from havilah on the road to shur which is before egypt
 he took agag king of the amalekites prisoner and put all the people to the sword without mercy
 but saul and the people did not put agag to death and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs and whatever was good not desiring to put them to the curse but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the curse
 then the lord said to samuel
 it is no longer my pleasure for saul to be king for he is turned back from going in my ways and has not done my orders and samuel was very sad crying to the lord in prayer all night
 and early in the morning he got up and went to saul and word was given to samuel that saul had come to carmel and put up a pillar and had gone from there down to gilgal
 and samuel came to saul and saul said to him may the blessing of the lord be with you i have done what was ordered by the lord
 and samuel said what then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears
 and saul said they have taken them from the amalekites for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the lord your god all the rest we have given up to destruction
 then samuel said to saul say no more  let me give you word of what the lord has said to me this night and he said to him say on
 and samuel said though you may seem little to yourself are you not head of the tribes of israel for the lord with the holy oil made you king over israel
 and the lord sent you on a journey and said go and put to the curse those sinners the amalekites fighting against them till every one is dead
 why then did you not do the orders of the lord but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the lord
 and saul said truly i have done the orders of the lord and have gone the way the lord sent me i have taken agag the king of amalek and have given the amalekites up to destruction
