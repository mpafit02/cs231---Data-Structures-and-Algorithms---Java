 so that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds
 the lord will send a skin disease attacking your knees and your legs bursting out from your feet to the top of your head so that nothing will make you well
 and you and the king whom you have put over you will the lord take away to a nation strange to you and to your fathers there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone
 and you will become a wonder and a name of shame among all the nations where the lord will take you
 you will take much seed out into the field and get little in for the locust will get it
 you will put in vines and take care of them but you will get no wine or grapes from them for they will be food for worms
 your land will be full of olive trees but there will be no oil for the comfort of your body for your olive tree will give no fruit
 you will have sons and daughters but they will not be yours for they will go away prisoners into a strange land
 all your trees and the fruit of your land will be the locusts
 the man from a strange land who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you while you go down lower and lower
 he will let you have his wealth at interest and will have no need of yours he will be the head and you the tail
 and all these curses will come after you and overtake you till your destruction is complete because you did not give ear to the voice of the lord your god or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you
 these things will come on you and on your seed to be a sign and a wonder for ever
 because you did not give honour to the lord your god worshipping him gladly with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things
 for this cause you will become servants to those whom the lord your god will send against you without food and drink and clothing and in need of all things and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end to you
 the lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth coming with the flight of an eagle a nation whose language is strange to you
 a hard faced nation who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young
 he will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock till he has made your destruction complete
 your towns will be shut in by his armies till your high walls in which you put your faith have come down his armies will be round your towns through all your land which the lord your god has given you
 and your food will be the fruit of your body the flesh of the sons and daughters which the lord your god has given you because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters
 that man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother and to his dear wife and to of those his children who are still living
 and will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
 the most soft and delicate of your women who would not so much as put her foot on the earth so delicate is she will be hard hearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter
 and to her baby newly come to birth and to the children of her body for having no other food she will make a meal of them secretly because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
 if you will not take care to do all the words of this law recorded in this book honouring that name of glory and of fear the lord your god
 then the lord your god will make your punishment and the punishment of your seed a thing to be wondered at great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years
 he will send on you again all the diseases of egypt which were a cause of fear to you and they will take you in their grip
 and all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the lord send on you till your destruction is complete
 and you will become a very small band though your numbers were like the stars of heaven because you did not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 and as the lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you so the lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage
