 and say to them take up from the middle of jordan from the place where the feet of the priests were resting twelve stones and take them over with you and put them down in the place where you take your rest tonight
 so joshua sent for the twelve men whom he had ready one man out of every tribe of the children of israel
 and he said to them go over before the ark of the lord your god into the middle of jordan and let every one of you take up a stone on his back one for every tribe of the children of israel
 so that this may be a sign among you when your children say to you in time to come what is the reason for these stones
 then you will say to them because the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the lords agreement when it went over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones will be a sign for the children of israel keeping it in their memory for ever
 so the children of israel did as joshua gave them orders and took twelve stones from the middle of jordan as the lord had said to joshua one for every tribe of the children of israel these they took across with them to their nights resting place and put them down there
 and joshua put up twelve stones in the middle of jordan where the feet of the priests who took up the ark of the agreement had been placed and there they are to this day
 for the priests who took up the ark kept there in the middle of jordan till all the orders given to joshua by moses from the lord had been done then the people went over quickly
 and when all the people had come to the other side the ark of the lord went over and the priests before the eyes of the people
 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh went over armed before the children of israel as moses had said to them
 about forty thousand armed for war went over before the lord to the fight to the lowlands of jericho
 that day the lord made joshua great in the eyes of all israel and all the days of his life they went in fear of him as they had gone in fear of moses
 then the lord said to joshua
 give orders to the priests who take up the ark of witness to come up out of jordan
 so joshua gave orders to the priests saying come up now out of jordan
 and when the priests who took up the ark of the lords agreement came up out of jordan and their feet came out on to dry land the waters of jordan went back to their place overflowing its edges as before
 so on the tenth day of the first month the people came up out of jordan and put up their tents in gilgal on the east side of jericho
 and the twelve stones which they took out of jordan joshua put up in gilgal
 and he said to the children of israel when your children say to their fathers in time to come what is the reason for these stones
 then give your children the story and say israel came over this river jordan on dry land
 for the lord your god made the waters of jordan dry before you till you had gone across as he did to the red sea drying it up before us till we had gone across
 so that all the peoples of the earth may see that the hand of the lord is strong and that they may go in fear of the lord your god for ever
 now when the news came to all the kings of the amorites on the west side of jordan and all the kings of the canaanites living by the sea how the lord had made the waters of jordan dry before the children of israel till they had gone across their hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in them because of the children of israel
 at that time the lord said to joshua make yourself stone knives and give the children of israel circumcision a second time
 so joshua made stone knives and gave the children of israel circumcision at gibeath ha araloth
 and this is the reason why joshua did so all the males of the people who came out of egypt all the fighting men had been overtaken by death in the waste land on the way after they came out of egypt
 all the people who came out had undergone circumcision but all the people whose birth had taken place in the waste land on their journey from egypt had not
 for the children of israel were wandering in the waste land for forty years till all the nation that is all the fighting men who had come out of egypt were dead because they did not give ear to the voice of the lord to whom the lord said with an oath that he would not let them see the land which the lord had given his word to their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey
 and their children who came up in their place now underwent circumcision by the hands of joshua not having had it before for there had been no circumcision on the journey
 so when all the nation had undergone circumcision they kept in their tents till they were well again
