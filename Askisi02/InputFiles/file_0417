 for you are my light o lord and the lord will make the dark bright for me
 by your help i have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in by the help of my god i have gone over a wall
 as for god his way is all good the word of the lord is tested he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him
 for who is god but the lord and who is a rock but our god
 god puts a strong band about me guiding me in a straight way
 he makes my feet like roes feet and puts me on high places
 he makes my hands expert in war so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms
 you have given me the breastplate of your salvation and your mercy has made me great
 you have made my steps wide under me so that my feet make no slip
 i go after my haters and overtake them not turning back till they are all overcome
 i have sent destruction on them and given them wounds so that they are not able to get up they are stretched under my feet
 for i have been armed by you with strength for the fight you have made low under me those who came out against me
 by you their backs are turned in flight so that my haters are cut off
 they were crying out but there was no one to come to their help even to the lord but he gave them no answer
 then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets
 you have made me free from the fightings of my people you have made me the head of the nations a people of whom i had no knowledge will be my servants
 men of other countries will with false hearts put themselves under my authority from the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me
 they will be wasted away they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear
 the lord is living praise be to my rock and let the god of my salvation be honoured
 it is god who sends punishment on my haters and puts peoples under my rule
 he makes me free from my haters i am lifted up over those who come up against me you have made me free from the violent man
 because of this i will give you praise o lord among the nations and will make a song of praise to your name
 great salvation does he give to his king he has mercy on the king of his selection david and on his seed for ever
 now these are the last words of david david the son of jesse says the man who was lifted up on high the man on whom the god of jacob put the holy oil the loved one of israels songs says
 the spirit of the lord had voice through me his word was on my tongue
 the god of israel said the word of the rock of israel came to me when an upright king is ruling over men when he is ruling in the fear of god
 it is as the light of the morning when the sun comes up a morning without clouds making young grass come to life from the earth
 for is not my house so with god for he has made with me an eternal agreement ordered in all things and certain as for all my salvation and all my desire will he not give it increase
 but the evil doers all of them will be like thorns to be pushed away because they may not be gripped in the hand
 but anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear and they will be burned with fire every one of them
