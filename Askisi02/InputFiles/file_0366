 then king hezekiah and the captains gave orders to the levites to give praise to god in the words of david and asaph the seer and they made songs of praise with joy and with bent heads gave worship
 then hezekiah made answer and said now that you have given yourselves to the lord come near and take offerings and praise offerings into the house of the lord so all the people took in offerings and praise offerings and those whose hearts were moved took in burned offerings
 the number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen a hundred male sheep and two hundred lambs all these were for burned offerings to the lord
 and the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
 there were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings so their brothers the levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy for the levites were more upright in heart to make themselves holy than the priests
 and there was a great amount of burned offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burned offering so the work of the lords house was put in order
 and hezekiah and all the people were full of joy because god had made the people ready for the thing was done suddenly
 then solomon made a start at building the house of the lord on mount moriah in jerusalem where the lord had been seen by his father david in the place which david had made ready in the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 the building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule
 and solomon put the base of the house of god in position by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide
 and the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and a hundred and twenty cubits high all plated inside with the best gold
 and the greater house was roofed with cypress wood plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palm trees and chains
 and the house was made beautiful with stones of great value and the gold was gold of parvaim
 all the house was plated with gold the supports the steps the walls and the doors and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones
 and he made the most holy place it was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide like the greater house and was plated all over with the best gold six hundred talents were used for it
 and fifty shekels weight of gold was used for the nails he had all the higher rooms plated with gold
 and in the most holy place he made images of two winged beings covering them with gold
 their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across one wing five cubits long touching the wall of the house and the other of the same size meeting the wing of the other winged one
 and in the same way the wings of the other five cubits long were stretched out one touching the wall and the other meeting the wing of the first winged one
 their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across they were placed upright on their feet facing the inner part of the house
 and he made the veil of blue and purple and red of the best linen worked with winged ones
 and in front of the house he made two pillars thirty five cubits high with crowns on the tops of them five cubits high
 and he made chains like neck ornaments and put them on the tops of the pillars and a hundred apples on the chains
 he put up the pillars in front of the temple one on the right side and one on the left naming the one on the right jachin and that on the left boaz
 then hezekiah sent word to all israel and judah and sent letters to ephraim and manasseh requesting them to come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover to the lord the god of israel
 for the king after discussion with his chiefs and all the body of the people in jerusalem had made a decision to keep the passover in the second month
 it was not possible to keep it at that time because not enough priests had made themselves holy and the people had not come together in jerusalem
 and the thing was right in the eyes of the king and all the people
 so it was ordered that word was to be sent out through all israel from beer sheba to dan that they were to come to keep the passover to the lord the god of israel at jerusalem because they had not kept it in great numbers in agreement with the law
 so runners went with letters from the king and his chiefs through all israel and judah by the order of the king saying o children of israel come back again to the lord the god of abraham isaac and israel so that he may come again to that small band of you which has been kept safe out of the hands of the kings of assyria
