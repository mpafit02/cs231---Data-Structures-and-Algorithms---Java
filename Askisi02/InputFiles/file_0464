 it is the lord who goes before you he will be with you he will not take away his help from you or give you up so have no fear
 then moses put all this law in writing and gave it to the priests the sons of levi who take up the ark of the lords agreement and to all the responsible men of israel
 and moses said to them at the end of every seven years at the time fixed for the ending of debts at the feast of tents
 when all israel has come before the lord your god in the place named by him let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all israel
 make all the people come together men and women and children and anyone from another country who is with you so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the lord your god and take care to do all the words of this law
 and so that your children to whom it is new may give ear and be trained in the fear of the lord your god while you are living in the land which you are going over jordan to take for your heritage
 at that time the lord said to moses the day of your death is near send for joshua and come to the tent of meeting so that i may give him his orders so moses and joshua went to the tent of meeting
 and the lord was seen in the tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the tent
 and the lord said to moses now you are going to rest with your fathers and this people will be false to me uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement i have made with them
 in that day my wrath will be moved against them and i will be turned away from them veiling my face from them and destruction will overtake them and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them so that in that day they will say have not these evils come on us because our god is not with us
 truly my face will be turned away from them in that day because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods
 make then this song for yourselves teaching it to the children of israel put it in their mouths so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel
 for when i have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers a land flowing with milk and honey and they have made themselves full of food and are fat then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement
 then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them this song will be a witness to them for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children for i see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now before i have taken them into the land of my oath
 so that same day moses made this song teaching it to the children of israel
 then he gave orders to joshua the son of nun saying to him be strong and take heart for you are to go at the head of the children of israel into the land which i made an oath to give them and i will be with you
 now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete
 moses said to the levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the lords agreement
 take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the lords agreement so that it may be a witness against you
 for i have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts even now while i am still living you will not be ruled by the lord how much less after my death
 get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes and your overseers so that i may say these things in their hearing and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them
 for i am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin wandering from the way which i have given you and evil will overtake you in the end because you will do evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath by the work of your hands
 then in the hearing of all the meeting of israel moses said the words of this song to the end
 give ear o heavens to my voice let the earth take note of the words of my mouth
 my teaching is dropping like rain coming down like dew on the fields like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants
 for i will give honour to the name of the lord let our god be named great
 he is the rock complete is his work for all his ways are righteousness a god without evil who keeps faith true and upright is he
 they have become false they are not his children the mark of sin is on them they are an evil and hard hearted generation
 is this your answer to the lord o foolish people and unwise is he not your father who has given you life he has made you and given you your place
 keep in mind the days of the past give thought to the years of generations gone by go to your father and he will make it clear to you to the old men and they will give you the story
