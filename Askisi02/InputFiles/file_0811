 breathing out grief all her people are looking for bread they have given their desired things for food to give them life see o lord and take note for she has become a thing of shame
 come to me all you who go by  keep your eyes on me and see if there is any pain like the pain of my wound which the lord has sent on me in the day of his burning wrath
 from on high he has sent fire into my bones and it has overcome them his net is stretched out for my feet i am turned back by him he has made me waste and feeble all the day
 a watch is kept on my sins they are joined together by his hand they have come on to my neck he has made my strength give way the lord has given me up into the hands of those against whom i have no power
 the lord has made sport of all my men of war in me he has got men together against me to send destruction on my young men the virgin daughter of judah has been crushed like grapes under the feet of the lord
 for these things i am weeping my eye is streaming with water because the comforter who might give me new life is far from me my children are made waste because the hater is strong
 zions hands are outstretched she has no comforter the lord has given orders to the attackers of jacob round about him jerusalem has become like an unclean thing among them
 the lord is upright for i have gone against his orders give ear now all you peoples and see my pain my virgins and my young men have gone away as prisoners
 i sent for my lovers but they were false to me my priests and my responsible men were breathing their last breath in the town while they were looking for food to give them new life
 see o lord for i am in trouble the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved my heart is turned in me for i have been uncontrolled outside the children are put to the sword and in the house there is death
 give ear to the voice of my grief i have no comforter all my haters have news of my troubles they are glad because you have done it let the day of fate come when they will be like me
 let all their evil doing come before you do to them as you have done to me for all my sins for loud is the sound of my grief and the strength of my heart is gone
 how has the daughter of zion been covered with a cloud by the lord in his wrath  he has sent down from heaven to earth the glory of israel and has not kept in memory the resting place of his feet in the day of his wrath
 the lord has given up to destruction all the living places of jacob without pity pulling down in his wrath the strong places of the daughter of judah stretching out on the earth the wounded even her king and her rulers
 in his burning wrath every horn of israel has been cut off his right hand has been turned back before the attacker he has put a fire in jacob causing destruction round about
 his bow has been bent for the attack he has taken his place with his hand ready in his hate he has put to death all who were pleasing to the eye on the tent of the daughter of zion he has let loose his passion like fire
 the lord has become like one fighting against her sending destruction on israel he has sent destruction on all her great houses making waste his strong places increasing the grief and the sorrow of the daughter of judah
 and he has violently taken away his tent as from a garden he has made waste his meeting place the lord has taken away the memory of feast and sabbath in zion and in the passion of his wrath he is against king and priest
 the lord has given up his altar and has been turned in hate from his holy place he has given up into the hands of the attacker the walls of her great houses their voices have been loud in the house of the lord as in the day of a holy meeting
 it is the lords purpose to make waste the wall of the daughter of zion his line has been stretched out he has not kept back his hand from destruction he has sent sorrow on tower and wall they have become feeble together
 her doors have gone down into the earth he has sent destruction on her locks her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not even her prophets have had no vision from the lord
 the responsible men of the daughter of zion are seated on the earth without a word they have put dust on their heads they are clothed in haircloth the heads of the virgins of jerusalem are bent down to the earth
 my eyes are wasted with weeping the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved my inner parts are drained out on the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town
 they say to their mothers where is grain and wine when they are falling like the wounded in the open squares of the town when their life is drained out on their mothers breast
 what example am i to give you what comparison am i to make for you o daughter of jerusalem what am i to make equal to you so that i may give you comfort o virgin daughter of zion for your destruction is great like the sea who is able to make you well
 the visions which your prophets have seen for you are false and foolish they have not made clear to you your sin so that your fate might be changed but they have seen for you false words driving you away
 all who go by make a noise with their hands at you they make hisses shaking their heads at the daughter of jerusalem and saying is this the town which was the crown of everything beautiful the joy of all the earth
 all your haters are opening their mouths wide against you making hisses and whistling through their teeth they say we have made a meal of her certainly this is the day we have been looking for it has come we have seen it
 the lord has done that which was his purpose he has put into force the orders which he gave in the days which are past pulling down without pity he has made your hater glad over you lifting up the horn of those who were against you
 let your cry go up to the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let your weeping be flowing down like a stream day and night give yourself no rest let not your eyes keep back the drops of sorrow
