 and by a prophet the lord made israel come up out of egypt and by a prophet he was kept safe
 i have been bitterly moved to wrath by ephraim so that his blood will be on him and the lord will make his shame come back on him
 when the words of my law came from ephraim he was lifted up in israel but when he did evil through the baal death overtook him
 and now their sins are increased they have made themselves a metal image false gods from their silver after their designs all of them the work of the metal workers they say of them let them give offerings let men give kisses to the oxen
 so they will be like the morning cloud like the dew which goes early away like the dust of the grain which the wind is driving out of the crushing floor like smoke going up from the fireplace
 but i am the lord your god from the land of egypt you have knowledge of no other god and there is no saviour but me
 i had knowledge of you in the waste land where no water was
 when i gave them food they were full and their hearts were full of pride and they did not keep me in mind
 so i will be like a lion to them as a cruel beast i will keep watch by the road
 i will come face to face with them like a bear whose young ones have been taken from her and their inmost hearts will be broken there the dogs will make a meal of them they will be wounded by the beasts of the field
 i have sent destruction on you o israel who will be your helper
 where is your king that he may be your saviour and all your rulers that they may take up your cause of whom you said give me a king and rulers
 i have given you a king because i was angry and have taken him away in my wrath
 the wrongdoing of ephraim is shut up his sin is put away in secret
 the pains of a woman in childbirth will come on him he is an unwise son for at this time it is not right for him to keep his place when children come to birth
 i will give the price to make them free from the power of the underworld i will be their saviour from death o death  where are your pains o underworld  where is your destruction my eyes will have no pity
 though he gives fruit among his brothers an east wind will come the wind of the lord coming up from the waste land and his spring will become dry his fountain will be without water it will make waste the store of all the vessels of his desire
 samaria will be made waste for she has gone against her god they will be cut down by the sword their little children will be broken on the rocks their women who are with child will be cut open
 o israel come back to the lord your god for your evil doing has been the cause of your fall
 take with you words and come back to the lord say to him let there be forgiveness for all wrongdoing so that we may take what is good and give in payment the fruit of our lips
 assyria will not be our salvation we will not go on horses we will not again say to the work of our hands you are our gods for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father
 i will put right their errors freely will my love be given to them for my wrath is turned away from him
 i will be as the dew to israel he will put out flowers like a lily and send out his roots like lebanon
 his branches will be stretched out he will be beautiful as the olive tree and sweet smelling as lebanon
 they will come back and have rest in his shade their life will be made new like the grain and they will put out flowers like the vine his name will be like the wine of lebanon
 as for ephraim what has he to do with false gods any longer i have given an answer and i will keep watch over him i am like a branching fir tree from me comes your fruit
 he who is wise will see these things he who has good sense will have knowledge of them for the ways of the lord are straight and the upright will go in them but sinners will be falling in them
 say to your brothers ammi and to your sisters ruhamah
 take up the cause against your mother take it up for she is not my wife and i am not her husband let her put away her loose ways from her face and her false ways from between her breasts
 for fear that i may take away her robe from her making her uncovered as in the day of her birth making her like a waste place and a dry land causing her death through need of water
