 their young men were burned in the fire and their virgins were not praised in the bride song
 their priests were put to death by the sword and their widows made no weeping for them
 then was the lord like one awaking from sleep and like a strong man crying out because of wine
 his haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever
 and he put the tent of joseph on one side and took not the tribe of ephraim
 but he took the tribe of judah for himself and the mountain of zion in which he had pleasure
 and he made his holy place like the high heaven like the earth which is fixed by him for ever
 he took david to be his servant taking him from the place of the flocks
 from looking after the sheep which were giving milk he took him to give food to jacob his people and to israel his heritage
 so he gave them food with an upright heart guiding them by the wisdom of his hands
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt o god the nations have come into your heritage they have made your holy temple unclean they have made jerusalem a mass of broken walls
 they have given the bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth
 their blood has been flowing like water round about jerusalem there was no one to put them in their last resting place
 we are looked down on by our neighbours we are laughed at and made sport of by those who are round us
 how long o lord will you be angry for ever will your wrath go on burning like fire
 let your wrath be on the nations who have no knowledge of you and on the kingdoms who have not made prayer to your name
 for they have taken jacob for their meat and made waste his house
 do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers let your mercy come to us quickly for we have been made very low
 give us help o god of our salvation for the glory of your name take us out of danger and give us forgiveness for our sins because of your name
 why may the nations say where is their god let payment for the blood of your servants be made openly among the nations before our eyes
 let the cry of the prisoner come before you with your strong arm make free the children of death
 and give punishment seven times over into the breast of our neighbours for the bitter words which they have said against you o lord
 so we your people and the sheep of your flock will give you glory for ever we will go on praising you through all generations
 &ltto the chief music maker on the gittith a psalm of david&gt o lord our lord whose glory is higher than the heavens how noble is your name in all the earth 
 you have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast because of those who are against you so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man
 when i see your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have put in their places
 what is man that you keep him in mind the son of man that you take him into account
 for you have made him only a little lower than the gods crowning him with glory and honour
 you have made him ruler over the works of your hands you have put all things under his feet
 all sheep and oxen and all the beasts of the field
