 any man cursing his father or his mother is to be put to death
 if in a fight one man gives another a blow with a stone or with the shut hand not causing his death but making him keep in bed
 if he is able to get up again and go about with a stick the other will be let off only he will have to give him payment for the loss of his time and see that he is cared for till he is well
 if a man gives his man servant or his woman servant blows with a rod causing death he is certainly to undergo punishment
 but at the same time if the servant goes on living for a day or two the master is not to get punishment for the servant is his property
 if men while fighting do damage to a woman with child causing the loss of the child but no other evil comes to her the man will have to make payment up to the amount fixed by her husband in agreement with the decision of the judges
 but if damage comes to her let life be given in payment for life
 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
 burning for burning wound for wound blow for blow
 if a man gives his man servant or his woman servant a blow in the eye causing its destruction he is to let him go free on account of the damage to his eye
 or if the loss of a tooth is caused by his blow he will let him go free on account of his tooth
 if an ox comes to be the cause of death to a man or a woman the ox is to be stoned and its flesh may not be used for food but the owner will not be judged responsible
 but if the ox has frequently done such damage in the past and the owner has had word of it and has not kept it under control so that it has been the cause of the death of a man or woman not only is the ox to be stoned but its owner is to be put to death
 if a price is put on his life let him make payment of whatever price is fixed
 if the death of a son or of a daughter has been caused the punishment is to be in agreement with this rule
 if the death of a man servant or of a woman servant is caused by the ox the owner is to give their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox is to be stoned
 if a man makes a hole in the earth without covering it up and an ox or an ass dropping into it comes to its death
 the owner of the hole is responsible he will have to make payment to their owner but the dead beast will be his
 and if one mans ox does damage to another mans ox causing its death then the living ox is to be exchanged for money and division made of the price of it and of the price of the dead one
 but if it is common knowledge that the ox has frequently done such damage in the past and its owner has not kept it under control he will have to give ox for ox and the dead beast will be his
 if a man takes without right another mans ox or his sheep and puts it to death or gets a price for it he is to give five oxen for an ox or four sheep for a sheep in payment the thief will have to make payment for what he has taken if he has no money he himself will have to be exchanged for money so that payment may be made
 if a thief is taken in the act of forcing his way into a house and his death is caused by a blow the owner of the house is not responsible for his blood
 but if it is after dawn he will be responsible
 if he still has what he had taken whatever it is ox or ass or sheep he is to give twice its value
 if a man makes a fire in a field or a vine garden and lets the fire do damage to another mans field he is to give of the best produce of his field or his vine garden to make up for it
 if there is a fire and the flames get to the thorns at the edge of the field causing destruction of the cut grain or of the living grain or of the field he who made the fire will have to make up for the damage
 if a man puts money or goods in the care of his neighbour to keep for him and it is taken from the mans house if they get the thief he will have to make payment of twice the value
 if they do not get the thief let the master of the house come before the judges and take an oath that he has not put his hand on his neighbours goods
 in any question about an ox or an ass or a sheep or clothing or about the loss of any property which anyone says is his let the two sides put their cause before god and he who is judged to be in the wrong is to make payment to his neighbour of twice the value
 if a man puts an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast into the keeping of his neighbour and it comes to death or is damaged or is taken away without any person seeing it
