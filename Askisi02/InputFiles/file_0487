 all the offspring of jacob were seventy persons and joseph had come to egypt before them
 then joseph came to his end and all his brothers and all that generation
 and the children of israel were fertile increasing very greatly in numbers and in power and the land was full of them
 now a new king came to power in egypt who had no knowledge of joseph
 and he said to his people see the people of israel are greater in number and in power than we are
 let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater and if there is a war they may be joined with those who are against us and make an attack on us and go up out of the land
 so they put overseers of forced work over them in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work and they made store towns for pharaoh pithom and raamses
 but the more cruel they were to them the more their number increased till all the land was full of them and the children of israel were hated by the egyptians
 and they gave the children of israel even harder work to do
 and made their lives bitter with hard work making building material and bricks and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions
 and the king of egypt said to the hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth  the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah 
 when you are looking after the hebrew women in childbirth if it is a son you are to put him to death but if it is a daughter she may go on living
 but the women had the fear of god and did not do as the king of egypt said but let the male children go on living
 and the king of egypt sent for the women and said to them why have you done this and let the male children go on living
 and they said to pharaoh because the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women for they are strong and the birth takes place before we come to them
 and the blessing of god was on these women and the people were increased in number and became very strong
 and because the women who took care of the hebrew mothers had the fear of god he gave them families
 and pharaoh gave orders to all his people saying every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river but every daughter may go on living
 and the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh for i have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard so that i may let my signs be seen among them
 and so that you may be able to give to your son and to your sons son the story of my wonders in egypt and the signs which i have done among them so that you may see that i am the lord
 then moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and said to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says how long will you be lifted up in your pride before me let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for if you will not let my people go tomorrow i will send locusts into your land
 and the face of the earth will be covered with them so that you will not be able to see the earth and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged everything which was not crushed by the ice storm and every tree still living in your fields
 and your houses will be full of them and the houses of your servants and of all the egyptians it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers from the day when they were living on the earth till this day and so he went out from pharaoh
 and pharaohs servants said to him how long is this man to be the cause of evil to us let the men go so that they may give worship to the lord their god are you not awake to egypts danger
 then moses and aaron came in again before pharaoh and he said to them go and give worship to the lord your god but which of you are going
 and moses said we will go with our young and our old with our sons and our daughters with our flocks and our herds for we are to keep a feast to the lord
 and he said to them may the lord be with you if i will let you and your little ones go  take care for your purpose clearly is evil
 not so but let your males go and give worship to the lord as your desire is this he said driving them out from before him
