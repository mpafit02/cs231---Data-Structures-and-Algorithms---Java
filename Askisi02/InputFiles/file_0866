 fifty three thousand four hundred of the tribe of naphtali were numbered
 these are they who were numbered by moses and aaron and by the twelve chiefs of israel one from every tribe
 so all those who were numbered of the children of israel by their families all those of twenty years old and over who were able to go to war
 were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty
 but the levites of the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them
 for the lord said to moses
 only the tribe of levi is not to be numbered among the children of israel
 but to them you are to give the care of the tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it they are to take up the tent and be responsible for everything to do with it and put up their tents round it
 and when the tent of meeting goes forward the levites are to take it down and when it is to be put up they are to do it any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death
 the children of israel are to put up their tents every man in his tent circle round his flag
 but the tents of the levites are to be round the tent of meeting so that wrath may not come on the children of israel the tent of meeting is to be in the care of the levites
 so the children of israel did as the lord had given orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses
 make two silver horns of hammered work to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents
 when they are sounded all the people are to come together to you at the door of the tent of meeting
 if only one of them is sounded then the chiefs the heads of the thousands of israel are to come to you
 when a loud note is sounded the tents placed on the east side are to go forward
 at the sound of a second loud note the tents on the south side are to go forward the loud note will be the sign to go forward
 but when all the people are to come together the horn is to be sounded but not loudly
 the horns are to be sounded by the sons of aaron the priests this is to be a law for you for ever from generation to generation
 and if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong then let the loud note of the horn be sounded and the lord your god will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you
 and on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace offerings and they will put the lord in mind of you i am the lord your god
