 truly i will not come into my house or go to my bed
 i will not give sleep to my eyes or rest to my eyeballs
 till i have got a place for the lord a resting place for the great god of jacob
 we had news of it at ephrathah we came to it in the fields of the wood
 let us go into his tent let us give worship at his feet
 come back o lord to your resting place you and the ark of your strength
 let your priests be clothed with righteousness and let your saints give cries of joy
 because of your servant david do not give up your king
 the lord gave a true oath to david which he will not take back saying i will give your kingdom to the fruit of your body
 if your children keep my word and the teachings which i will give them their children will be rulers of your kingdom for ever
 for the lords heart is on zion desiring it for his resting place
 this is my rest for ever here will i ever be for this is my desire
 my blessing will be on her food and her poor will be full of bread
 her priests will be clothed with salvation and her saints will give cries of joy
 there i will make the horn of david fertile i have made ready a light for my king
 his haters will be clothed with shame but i will make his crown shining
 &lta song of the going up of david&gt see how good and how pleasing it is for brothers to be living together in harmony 
 it is like oil of great price on the head flowing down over the face even aarons face coming down to the edge of his robe
 like the dew of hermon which comes down on the mountains of zion for there the lord gave orders for the blessing even life for ever
 &lta song of the going up&gt give praise to the lord all you servants of the lord who take your places in the house of the lord by night
 give praise to the lord lifting up your hands in his holy place
 may the lord who made heaven and earth send you blessing out of zion
 let the lord be praised o you servants of the lord give praise to the name of the lord
 you who are in the house of the lord and in the open spaces of the house of our god
 give praise to jah for he is good make melody to his name for it is pleasing
 for the lord has taken jacob for himself and israel for his property
 i know that the lord is great and that our lord is greater than all other gods
 the lord has done whatever was pleasing to him in heaven and on the earth in the seas and in all the deep waters
 he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes thunder flames for the rain he sends out the winds from his store houses
 he put to death the first fruits of egypt of man and of beast
