 and have taken your people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm causing great fear
 and have given them this land which you gave your word to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
 and they came in and took it for their heritage but they did not give ear to your voice and were not ruled by your law they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do so you have made all this evil come on them
 see they have made earthworks against the town to take it and the town is given into the hands of the chaldaeans who are fighting against it because of the sword and need of food and disease and what you have said has taken place and truly you see it
 and you have said to me give the money to get yourself a property and have the business witnessed though the town is given into the hands of the chaldaeans
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 see i am the lord the god of all flesh is there anything so hard that i am unable to do it
 so this is what the lord has said see i am giving this town into the hands of the chaldaeans and into the hands of nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon and he will take it
 and the chaldaeans who are fighting against this town will come and put the town on fire burning it together with the houses on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the baal and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
 for the children of israel and the children of judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years the children of israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands says the lord
 for this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day so that i put it away from before my face
 because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to make me angry they and their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the people of jerusalem
 and they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me and though i was their teacher getting up early and teaching them their ears were not open to teaching
 but they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name making it unclean
 and they put up the high places of the baal in the valley of the son of hinnom making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to molech which i did not give them orders to do and it never came into my mind that they would do this disgusting thing causing judah to be turned out of the way
 and now the lord the god of israel has said of this town about which you say it is given into the hands of the king of babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 see i will get them together from all the countries where i have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling and i will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely
 and they will be my people and i will be their god
 and i will give them one heart and one way so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever for their good and the good of their children after them
 and i will make an eternal agreement with them that i will never give them up but ever do them good and i will put the fear of me in their hearts so that they will not go away from me
 and truly i will take pleasure in doing them good and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith
 for the lord has said as i have made all this great evil come on this people so i will send on them all the good which i said about them
 and there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say it is a waste without man or beast it is given into the hands of the chaldaeans
 men will get fields for money and put the business in writing stamping the papers and having them witnessed in the land of benjamin and in the country round jerusalem and in the towns of judah and in the towns of the hill country and in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the south for i will let their fate be changed says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah the second time while he was still shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
 these are the words of the lord who is doing it the lord who is forming it to make it certain the lord is his name
 let your cry come to me and i will give you an answer and let you see great things and secret things of which you had no knowledge
 for this is what the lord the god of israel has said about the houses of this town and the houses of the kings of judah which have been broken down to make earthworks and 
  and to make them full of the dead bodies of men whom i have put to death in my wrath and in my passion and because of whose evil doing i have kept my face covered from this town
 see i will make it healthy and well again i will even make them well i will let them see peace and good faith in full measure
