 solomon was king over israel in jerusalem for forty years
 and solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and rehoboam his son became king in his place
 after the death of ahab moab made itself free from the authority of israel
 now ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in samaria and was ill and he sent men and said to them put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron about the outcome of my disease to see if i will get well or not
 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite go now and meeting the men sent by the king of samaria say to them is it because there is no god in israel that you are going to get directions from baal zebub the god of ekron
 give ear then to the words of the lord you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you then elijah went away
 and the men he had sent came back to the king and he said to them why have you come back
 and they said to him on our way we had a meeting with a man who said go back to the king who sent you and say to him the lord says is it because there is no god in israel that you send to put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron for this reason you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
 and he said to them what sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you
 and they said in answer he was a man clothed in a coat of hair with a leather band about his body then he said it is elijah the tishbite
 then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill and said to him o man of god the king has said come down
 and elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty if i am a man of god may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
 then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men and he said to elijah o man of god the king says come down quickly
 and elijah in answer said if i am a man of god may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you and the fire of god came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
 then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men and the third captain of fifty went up and falling on his knees before elijah requesting mercy of him said o man of god let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to you
 for fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties but now let my life be of value in your eyes
 then the angel of the lord said to elijah go down with him have no fear of him so he got up and went down with him to the king
 and he said to him this is the word of the lord because you sent men to put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
 so death came to him as the lord had said by the mouth of elijah and jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of jehoram son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son
 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 now there were in samaria seventy of ahabs sons and jehu sent letters to samaria to the rulers of the town and to the responsible men and to those who had the care of the sons of ahab saying
 straight away when you get this letter seeing that your masters sons are with you and that you have carriages and horses and a walled town and arms
 take the best and most upright of your masters sons and make him king in his fathers place and put up a fight for your masters family
 but they were full of fear and said the two kings have gone down before him how may we keep our place
 so the controller of the kings house with the ruler of the town and the responsible men and those who had the care of ahabs sons sent to jehu saying we are your servants and will do all your orders we will not make any man king do whatever seems best to you
 then he sent them a second letter saying if you are on my side and if you will do my orders come to me at jezreel by this time tomorrow with the heads of your masters sons now the kings seventy sons were with the great men of the town who had the care of them
 and when the letter came to them they took the kings sons and put them to death all the seventy and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at jezreel
 and a man came and said to him they have come with the heads of the kings sons and he said put them down in two masses at the doorway of the town till the morning
 and in the morning he went out and stopping said to all the people there you are upright men it is true that i made designs against my master and put him to death but who is responsible for the death of all these
 you may be certain that nothing which the lord has said about the family of ahab will be without effect for the lord has done what he said by his servant elijah
