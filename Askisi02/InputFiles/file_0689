 a blessing is on the man who puts his faith in the lord and whose hope the lord is
 for he will be like a tree planted by the waters pushing out its roots by the stream he will have no fear when the heat comes but his leaf will be green in a dry year he will have no care and will go on giving fruit
 the heart is a twisted thing not to be searched out by man who is able to have knowledge of it
 i the lord am the searcher of the heart the tester of the thoughts so that i may give to every man the reward of his ways in keeping with the fruit of his doings
 like the partridge getting eggs together but not producing young is a man who gets wealth but not by right before half his days are ended it will go from him and at his end he will be foolish
 a seat of glory placed on high from the first is our holy place
 o lord the hope of israel all who give you up will be put to shame those who go away from you will be cut off from the earth because they have given up the lord the fountain of living waters
 make me well o lord and i will be well be my saviour and i will be safe for you are my hope
 see they say to me where is the word of the lord let it come now
 as for me i have not said let the day of trouble come to them quickly and i have not been hoping for the death giving day you have knowledge of what came from my lips it was open before you
 be not a cause of fear to me you are my safe place in the day of evil
 let them be put to shame who are attacking me but let me not be shamed let them be overcome with fear but let me not be overcome send on them the day of evil and put them to destruction twice over
 this is what the lord has said to me go and take your place in the doorway of benjamin where the kings of judah come in and by which they go out and in all the doorways of jerusalem
 and say to them give ear to the word of the lord you kings of judah and all the people of jerusalem who come in by these doors
 this is what the lord has said see to yourselves that you take up no weight on the sabbath day or take it in through the doors of jerusalem
 and take no weight out of your houses on the sabbath day or do any work but keep the sabbath day holy as i gave orders to your fathers
 but they gave no attention and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching
 and it will be that if with all care you give ear to me says the lord and take no weight through the doorways of this town on the sabbath day but keep the sabbath day holy and do no work in it
 then through the doors of this town there will come kings and princes seated on the seat of david going in carriages and on horseback they and their princes and the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and this town will keep its place for ever
 and they will come from the towns of judah and from the places round about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the lowlands and from the mountains and from the south with burned offerings and offerings of beasts and meal offerings and perfume and offerings of praise to the house of the lord
 but if you do not give ear to me to keep the sabbath day holy and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of jerusalem on the sabbath day then i will put a fire in its doorways burning up the great houses of jerusalem and it will never be put out
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 up  go down to the potters house and there i will let my words come to your ears
 then i went down to the potters house and he was doing his work on the stones
 and when the vessel which he was forming out of earth got damaged in the hand of the potter he made it again into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 o israel am i not able to do with you as this potter does says the lord see like earth in the potters hand are you in my hands o israel
 whenever i say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom and smashing it and sending destruction on it
 if in that very minute that nation of which i was talking is turned away from its evil my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed
 and whenever i say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom and planting it
