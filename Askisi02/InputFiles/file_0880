 the slope of the valleys going down to the tents of ar and touching the edge of moab
 from there they went on to beer the water spring of which the lord said to moses make the people come together and i will give them water
 then israel gave voice to this song come up o water spring let us make a song to it
 the fountain made by the chiefs made deep by the great ones of the people with the law givers rod and with their sticks then from the waste land they went on to mattanah
 and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
 and from bamoth to the valley in the open country of moab and to the top of pisgah looking over jeshimon
 and israel sent men to sihon king of the amorites saying
 let me go through your land we will not go into field or vine garden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway till we have gone past the limits of your land
 and sihon would not let israel go through his land but got all his people together and went out against israel into the waste land as far as jahaz to make war on israel
 but israel overcame him and took all his land from the arnon to the jabbok as far as the country of the children of ammon for the country of the children of ammon was strongly armed
 and israel took all their towns living in heshbon and all the towns and small places of the amorites
 for heshbon was the town of sihon king of the amorites who had made war against an earlier king of moab and taken from him all his land as far as the arnon
 so the makers of wise sayings say come to heshbon building up the town of sihon and making it strong
 for a fire has gone out of heshbon a flame from the town of sihon for the destruction of ar in moab and the lords of the high places of the arnon
 sorrow is yours o moab  destruction is your fate o people of chemosh his sons have gone in flight and his daughters are prisoners in the hands of sihon king of the amorites
 they are wounded with our arrows destruction has come on heshbon even to dibon and we have made the land waste as far as nophah stretching out to medeba
 so israel put up their tents in the land of the amorites
 and moses sent men secretly to jazer and they took its towns driving out the amorites who were living there
 then turning they went up by the way of bashan and og king of bashan went out against them with all his people to the fight at edrei
 and the lord said to moses have no fear of him for i have given him up into your hands with all his people and his land do to him as you did to sihon king of the amorites at heshbon
 so they overcame him and his sons and his people driving them all out and they took his land for their heritage
 then the children of israel journeying on put up their tents in the lowlands of moab on the other side of jordan at jericho
 now balak the son of zippor saw what israel had done to the amorites
 and in moab there was great fear of the people because their numbers were so great and the feeling of moab was bitter against the children of israel
 then moab said to the responsible men of midian it is clear that this great people will be the destruction of everything round us making a meal of us as the ox does of the grass of the field at that time balak the son of zippor was king of moab
 so he sent men to balaam son of beor at pethor by the river in the land of the children of his people saying to him see a people has come out of egypt covering all the face of the earth and they have put up their tents opposite to me
 come now in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people for they are greater than i and then i may be strong enough to overcome them and send them out of the land for it is clear that good comes to him who has your blessing but he on whom you put your curse is cursed
 so the responsible men of moab and midian went away taking in their hands rewards for the prophet and they came to balaam and said to him what balak had given them orders to say
 and he said to them take your rest here tonight and i will give you an answer after hearing what the lord says so the chiefs of moab kept there with balaam that night
 and god came to balaam and said who are these men with you
