 then the lord said to moses take all the chiefs of the people hanging them up in the sun before the lord so that the wrath of the lord may be turned from israel
 so moses said to the judges of israel let everyone put to death those of his men who have had relations with the women of moab in honour of the baal of peor
 then one of the children of israel came to his brothers taking with him a woman of midian before the eyes of moses and all the meeting of the people while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest seeing it got up from among the people and took a spear in his hand
 and went after the man of israel into the tent driving the spear through the two of them through the man of israel and through the stomach of the woman so the disease was stopped among the children of israel
 but twenty four thousand of them had come to their death by the disease
 and the lord said to moses
 through phinehas and because of his passion for my honour my wrath has been turned away from the children of israel so that i have not sent destruction on them all in my wrath
 so say to them that i will make with him an agreement of peace
 and by this agreement he and his sons after him have the right to be priests for ever because by his care for the honour of his god he took away the sin of the children of israel
 now the man of israel who was put to death with the woman of midian was zimri the son of salu a chief of one of the families of the simeonites
 and the woman of midian who was put to death was cozbi the daughter of zur he was the head of a family in midian
 then the lord said to moses
 take up arms against the midianites and overcome them
 for they are a danger to you with their false ways causing sin to come on you in the question of peor and because of cozbi their sister the daughter of the chief of midian who was put to death at the time of the disease which came on you because of peor
 now after the disease was over the lord said to moses and eleazar the son of aaron the priest
 let all the children of israel be numbered by the names of their fathers families all those of twenty years old and over who are able to go to war in israel
 so moses and eleazar the priest gave them the order in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho saying
 let all the people of twenty years old and over be numbered as the lord has given orders to moses and the children of israel who have come out of egypt

 and they went down into the open mouth of the earth together with korah when death overtook him and all his band at the time when two hundred and fifty men were burned in the fire and they became a sign
 but death did not overtake the sons of korah
