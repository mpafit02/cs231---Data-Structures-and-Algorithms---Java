 fear has overcome them they have no more answers to give they have come to an end of words
 and am i to go on waiting while they have nothing to say while they keep quiet and give no more answers
 i will give my answer i will put forward my knowledge
 for i am full of words i am unable to keep in my breath any longer
 my stomach is like wine which is unable to get out like skins full of new wine it is almost burst
 let me say what is in my mind so that i may get comfort let me give answer with open mouth
 let me not give respect to any man or give names of honour to any living
 for i am not able to give names of honour to any man and if i did my maker would quickly take me away
 and now o job give ear to my words and take note of all i say
 see now my mouth is open my tongue gives out words
 my heart is overflowing with knowledge my lips say what is true
 the spirit of god has made me and the breath of the ruler of all gives me life
 if you are able give me an answer put your cause in order and come forward
 see i am the same as you are in the eyes of god i was cut off from the same bit of wet earth
 fear of me will not overcome you and my hand will not be hard on you
 but you said in my hearing and your voice came to my ears
 i am clean without sin i am washed and there is no evil in me
 see he is looking for something against me in his eyes i am as one of his haters
 he puts chains on my feet he is watching all my ways
 truly in saying this you are wrong for god is greater than man
 why do you put forward your cause against him saying he gives no answer to any of my words
 for god gives his word in one way even in two and man is not conscious of it
 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep comes on men while they take their rest on their beds
 then he makes his secrets clear to men so that they are full of fear at what they see
 in order that man may be turned from his evil works and that pride may be taken away from him
 to keep back his soul from the underworld and his life from destruction
 pain is sent on him as a punishment while he is on his bed there is no end to the trouble in his bones
 he has no desire for food and his soul is turned away from delicate meat
 his flesh is so wasted away that it may not be seen and his bones 
 and his soul comes near to the underworld and his life to the angels of death
