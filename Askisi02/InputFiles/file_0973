 the lord is living praise be to my rock and let the god of my salvation be honoured
 it is god who sends punishment on my haters and puts peoples under my rule
 he makes me free from my haters i am lifted up over those who come up against me you have made me free from the violent man
 because of this i will give you praise o lord among the nations and will make a song of praise to your name
 great salvation does he give to his king he has mercy on the king of his selection david and on his seed for ever
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt the heavens are sounding the glory of god the arch of the sky makes clear the work of his hands
 day after day it sends out its word and night after night it gives knowledge
 there are no words or language their voice makes no sound
 their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them has he put a tent for the sun
 who is like a newly married man coming from his bride tent and is glad like a strong runner starting on his way
 his going out is from the end of the heaven and his circle to the ends of it there is nothing which is not open to his heat
 the law of the lord is good giving new life to the soul the witness of the lord is certain giving wisdom to the foolish
 the orders of the lord are right making glad the heart the rule of the lord is holy giving light to the eyes
 the fear of the lord is clean and has no end the decisions of the lord are true and full of righteousness
 more to be desired are they than gold even than much shining gold sweeter than the dropping honey
 by them is your servant made conscious of danger and in keeping them there is great reward
 who has full knowledge of his errors make me clean from secret evil
 keep your servant back from sins of pride let them not have rule over me then will i be upright and free from great sin
 let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your eyes o lord my strength and my salvation
 why are the nations so violently moved and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish
 the kings of the earth have taken their place and the rulers are fixed in their purpose against the lord and against the king of his selection saying
 let their chains be broken and their cords taken from off us
 then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing the lord will make sport of them
 then will his angry words come to their ears and by his wrath they will be troubled
 but i have put my king on my holy hill of zion
 i will make clear the lords decision he has said to me you are my son this day have i given you being
 make your request to me and i will give you the nations for your heritage and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand
 they will be ruled by you with a rod of iron they will be broken like a potters vessel
 so now be wise you kings take his teaching you judges of the earth
 give worship to the lord with fear kissing his feet and giving him honour
