 but if i give praise to god for the food which i take let no man say evil of me for that reason
 so then if it is a question of food or drink or any other thing whatever you do do all to the glory of god
 give no cause of trouble to jews or to greeks or to the church of god
 even as i give way to all men in all things not looking for profit for myself but for the good of others that they may get salvation
 so take me for your example even as i take christ for mine
 now i am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you
 but it is important for you to keep this fact in mind that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
 every man who takes part in prayer or gives teaching as a prophet with his head covered puts shame on his head
 but every woman who does so with her head unveiled puts shame on her head for it is the same as if her hair was cut off
 for if a woman is not veiled let her hair be cut off but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off let her be veiled
 for it is not right for a man to have his head covered because he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
 for the man did not come from the woman but the woman from the man
 and the man was not made for the woman but the woman for the man
 for this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels
 but the woman is not separate from the man and the man is not separate from the woman in the lord
 for as the woman is from the man so the man is through the woman but all things are from god
 be judges yourselves of the question does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled
 does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair it is a cause of shame to him
 but if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given to her for a covering
 but if any man will not be ruled in this question this is not our way of doing things and it is not done in the churches of god
 but in giving you this order there is one thing about which i am not pleased it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
 for first of all it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church there are divisions among you and i take the statement to be true in part
 for divisions are necessary among you in order that those who have gods approval may be clearly seen among you
 but now when you come together it is not possible to take the holy meal of the lord
 for when you take your food everyone takes his meal before the other and one has not enough food and another is the worse for drink
 what have you not houses to take your meals in or have you no respect for the church of god putting the poor to shame what am i to say to you am i to give you praise certainly not
 for it was handed down to me from the lord as i gave it to you that the lord jesus on the night when judas was false to him took bread
 and when it had been broken with an act of praise he said this is my body which is for you do this in memory of me
 in the same way with the cup after the meal he said this cup is the new testament in my blood do this whenever you take it in memory of me
 for whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the lords death till he comes
