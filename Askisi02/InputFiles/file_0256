 and the law came in addition to make wrongdoing worse but where there was much sin there was much more grace
 that as sin had power in death so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
 what may we say then are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace
 in no way how may we who are dead to sin be living in it any longer
 or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into christ jesus had baptism into his death
 we have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death so that as christ came again from the dead by the glory of the father we in the same way might be living in new life
 for if we have been made like him in his death we will in the same way be like him in his coming to life again
 being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him so that the body of sin might be put away and we might no longer be servants to sin
 because he who is dead is free from sin
 but if we are dead with christ we have faith that we will be living with him
 having knowledge that because christ has come back from the dead he will never again go down to the dead death has no more power over him
 for his death was a death to sin but his life now is a life which he is living to god
 even so see yourselves as dead to sin but living to god in christ jesus
 for this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death so that you give way to its desires
 and do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing but give yourselves to god as those who are living from the dead and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to god
 for sin may not have rule over you because you are not under law but under grace
 what then are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace let it not be so
 are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire if to sin the end being death or if to do the desire of god the end being righteousness
 but praise be to god that though you were the servants of sin you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed
 and being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness
 i am using words in the way of men because your flesh is feeble as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean and to evil to do evil so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy
 when you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness
 what fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you for the end of such things is death
 but now being free from sin and having been made servants to god you have your fruit in that which is holy and the end is eternal life
 for the reward of sin is death but what god freely gives is eternal life in jesus christ our lord
 is it not clear my brothers  i am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law  that the law has power over a man as long as he is living
 for the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living but if her husband is dead she is free from the law of the husband
 so if while the husband is living she is joined to another man she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband but if the husband is dead she is free from the law so that she is not untrue even if she takes another man
 in the same way my brothers you were made dead to the law through the body of christ so that you might be joined to another even to him who came again from the dead so that we might give fruit to god
 for when we were in the flesh the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death
