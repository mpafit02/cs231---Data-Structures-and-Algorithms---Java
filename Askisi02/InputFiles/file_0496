 and moses went up to god and the voice of the lord came to him from the mountain saying say to the family of jacob and give word to the children of israel
 you have seen what i did to the egyptians and how i took you as on eagles wings guiding you to myself
 if now you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement you will be my special property out of all the peoples for all the earth is mine
 and you will be a kingdom of priests to me and a holy nation these are the words which you are to say to the children of israel
 and moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the lord had given him orders to say
 and all the people answering together said whatever the lord has said we will do and moses took back to the lord the words of the people
 and the lord said to moses see i will come to you in a thick cloud so that what i say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever and moses gave the lord word of what the people had said
 and the lord said to moses go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow and let their clothing be washed
 and by the third day let them be ready for on the third day the lord will come down on mount sinai before the eyes of all the people
 and let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain and say to them take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death
 he is not to be touched by a hand but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him man or beast he is to be put to death at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain
 then moses went down from the mountain to the people and made the people holy and their clothing was washed
 and he said to the people be ready by the third day do not come near a woman
 and when morning came on the third day there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain and a horn sounding very loud and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear
 and moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before god and they came to the foot of the mountain
 and all the mountain of sinai was smoking for the lord had come down on it in fire and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning and all the mountain was shaking
 and when the sound of the horn became louder and louder moses words were answered by the voice of god
 then the lord came down on to mount sinai to the top of the mountain and the lord sent for moses to come up to the top of the mountain and moses went up
 and the lord said to moses go down and give the people orders to keep back for fear that a great number of them forcing their way through to see the lord may come to destruction
 and let the priests who come near to the lord make themselves holy for fear that the lord may come on them suddenly
 and moses said to the lord the people will not be able to come up the mountain for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain marking it out and making it holy
 and the lord said to him go down and you and aaron may come up but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the lord or he will come on them suddenly
 so moses went down to the people and said this to them
 now a man of the house of levi took as his wife a daughter of levi
 and she became with child and gave birth to a son and when she saw that he was a beautiful child she kept him secretly for three months
 and when she was no longer able to keep him secret she made him a basket out of the stems of water plants pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the nile
 and his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him
 now pharaohs daughter came down to the nile to take a bath while her women were walking by the riverside and she saw the basket among the river plants and sent her servant girl to get it
 and opening it she saw the child and he was crying and she had pity on him and said this is one of the hebrews children
 then his sister said to pharaohs daughter may i go and get you one of the hebrew women to give him the breast
