 and the wife is not the same as the virgin the virgin gives her mind to the things of the lord so that she may be holy in body and in spirit but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world how she may give pleasure to her husband
 now i say this for your profit not to make things hard for you but because of what is right and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the lord
 but if in any mans opinion he is not doing what is right for his virgin if she is past her best years and there is need for it let him do what seems right to him it is no sin let them be married
 but the man who is strong in mind and purpose who is not forced but has control over his desires does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin
 so then he who gets married to his virgin does well and he who keeps her unmarried does better
 it is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living but when her husband is dead she is free to be married to another but only to a christian
 but it will be better for her to keep as she is in my opinion and it seems to me that i have the spirit of god
 now about things offered to images we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge knowledge gives pride but love gives true strength
 if anyone seems to himself to have knowledge so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything
 but if anyone has love for god god has knowledge of him
 so then as to the question of taking food offered to images we are certain that an image is nothing in the world and that there is no god but one
 for though there are those who have the name of gods in heaven or on earth as there are a number of gods and a number of lords
 there is for us only one god the father of whom are all things and we are for him and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and we have our being through him
 still all men have not that knowledge but some being used till now to the image are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image and because they are not strong in the faith their minds are troubled
 but gods approval of us is not based on the food we take if we do not take it we are no worse for it and if we take it we are no better
 but take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble
 for if a man sees you who have knowledge taking food as a guest in the house of an image will it not give him if he is feeble the idea that he may take food offered to images
 and so through your knowledge you are the cause of destruction to your brother for whom christ underwent death
 and in this way doing evil to the brothers and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble you are sinning against christ
 for this reason if food is a cause of trouble to my brother i will give up taking meat for ever so that i may not be a cause of trouble to my brother
 am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not my work in the lord
 if to others i am not an apostle at least i am one to you for the fact that you are christians is the sign that i am an apostle
 my answer to those who are judging me is this
 have we no right to take food and drink
 have we no right to take about with us a christian wife like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas
 or i only and barnabas have we no right to take a rest from work
 who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk
 am i talking as a man does not the law say the same
 for it says in the law of moses it is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it is it for the oxen that god is giving orders
 or has he us in mind yes it was said for us because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it
