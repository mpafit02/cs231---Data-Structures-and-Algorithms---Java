 and the man went out to the east with the line in his hand and after measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came over my feet
 and again measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came up to my knees again measuring a thousand he made me go through the waters up to the middle of my body
 again after his measuring a thousand it became a river which it was not possible to go through for the waters had become deep enough for swimming a river it was not possible to go through
 and he said to me son of man have you seen this then he took me to the rivers edge
 and he took me back and i saw at the edge of the river a very great number of trees on this side and on that
 and he said to me these waters are flowing out to the east part of the land and down into the arabah and they will go to the sea and the waters will be made sweet
 and it will come about that every living and moving thing wherever their streams come will have life and there will be very much fish because these waters have come there and have been made sweet and everything wherever the river comes will have life
 and fishermen will take up their places by it from en gedi as far as en eglaim will be a place for the stretching out of nets the fish will be of every sort like the fish of the great sea a very great number
 the wet places and the pools will not be made sweet they will be given up to salt
 and by the edge of the river on this side and on that will come up every tree used for food whose leaves will ever be green and its fruit will not come to an end it will have new fruit every month because its waters come out from the holy place the fruit will be for food and the leaf will make well those who are ill
