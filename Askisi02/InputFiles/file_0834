 and in the eighth year you will put in your seed and get your food from the old stores till the fruit of the ninth year is ready
 no exchange of land may be for ever for the land is mine and you are as my guests living with me for a time
 wherever there is property in land the owner is to have the right of getting it back
 if your brother becomes poor and has to give up some of his land for money his nearest relation may come and get back that which his brother has given up
 and if he has no one to get it back for him and later he himself gets wealth and has enough money to get it back
 then let him take into account the years from the time when he gave it up and make up the loss for the rest of the years to him who took it and so get back his property
 but if he is not able to get it back for himself then it will be kept by him who gave a price for it till the year of jubilee and in that year it will go back to its first owner and he will have his property again
 and if a man gives his house in a walled town for money he has the right to get it back for the space of a full year after he has given it up
 and if he does not get it back by the end of the year then the house in the town will become the property of him who gave the money for it and of his children for ever it will not go from him in the year of jubilee
 but houses in small unwalled towns will be the same as property in the country they may be got back and they will go back to their owners in the year of jubilee
 but the houses in the towns of the levites may be got back by the levites at any time
 and if a levite does not give money to get back his property his house in the town which was exchanged for money will come back to him in the year of jubilee for the houses of the towns of the levites are their property among the children of israel
 but the land on the outskirts of their towns may not be exchanged for money for it is their property for ever
 and if your brother becomes poor and is not able to make a living then you are to keep him with you helping him as you would a man from another country who is living among you
 take no interest from him in money or in goods but have the fear of your god before you and let your brother make a living among you
 do not take interest on the money which you let him have or on the food which you give him
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan that i might be your god
 and if your brother becomes poor and gives himself to you for money do not make use of him like a servant who is your property
 but let him be with you as a servant working for payment till the year of jubilee
 then he will go out from you he and his children with him and go back to his family and to the property of his fathers
 for they are my servants whom i took out from the land of egypt they may not become the property of another
 do not be a hard master to him but have the fear of god before you
 but you may get servants as property from among the nations round about from them you may take men servants and women servants
 and in addition you may get for money servants from among the children of other nations who are living with you and from their families which have come to birth in your land and these will be your property
 and they will be your childrens heritage after you to keep as their property they will be your servants for ever but you may not be hard masters to your countrymen the children of israel
 and if one from another nation living among you gets wealth and your countryman at his side becomes poor and gives himself for money to the man from another nation or to one of his family
 after he has given himself he has the right to be made free for a price by one of his brothers
 or his fathers brother or the son of his fathers brother or any near relation or if he gets money he may make himself free
 and let the years be numbered from the time when he gave himself to his owner till the year of jubilee and the price given for him will be in relation to the number of years on the scale of the payment of a servant
 if there is still a long time he will give back on account of it a part of the price which was given for him
