 the hater of work seems to himself wiser than seven men who are able to give an answer with good sense
 he who gets mixed up in a fight which is not his business is like one who takes a dog by the ears while it is going by
 as one who is off his head sends about flaming sticks and arrows of death
 so is the man who gets the better of his neighbour by deceit and says am i not doing so in sport
 without wood the fire goes out and where there is no secret talk argument is ended
 like breath on coals and wood on fire so a man given to argument gets a fight started
 the words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food they go down into the inner parts of the stomach
 smooth lips and an evil heart are like a vessel of earth plated with silver waste
 with his lips the hater makes things seem what they are not but deceit is stored up inside him
 when he says fair words have no belief in him for in his heart are seven evils
 though his hate is covered with deceit his sin will be seen openly before the meeting of the people
 he who makes a hole in the earth will himself go falling into it and on him by whom a stone is rolled the stone will come back again
 a false tongue has hate for those who have clean hearts and a smooth mouth is a cause of falling
 do not make a noise about tomorrow for you are not certain what a days outcome may be
 let another man give you praise and not your mouth one who is strange to you and not your lips
 a stone has great weight and sand is crushing but the wrath of the foolish is of greater weight than these
 wrath is cruel and angry feeling an overflowing stream but who does not give way before envy
 better is open protest than love kept secret
 the wounds of a friend are given in good faith but the kisses of a hater are false
 the full man has no use for honey but to the man in need of food every bitter thing is sweet
 like a bird wandering from the place of her eggs is a man wandering from his station
 oil and perfume make glad the heart and the wise suggestion of a friend is sweet to the soul
 do not give up your friend and your fathers friend and do not go into your brothers house in the day of your trouble better is a neighbour who is near than a brother far off
 my son be wise and make my heart glad so that i may give back an answer to him who puts me to shame
 the sharp man sees the evil and takes cover the simple go straight on and get into trouble
 take a mans clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men
 he who gives a blessing to his friend with a loud voice getting up early in the morning will have it put to his account as a curse
 like an unending dropping on a day of rain is a bitter tongued woman
 he who keeps secret the secret of his friend will get himself a name for good faith
 iron makes iron sharp so a man makes sharp his friend
