 now about the giving of money for the saints as i gave orders to the churches of galatia so do you
 on the first day of the week let every one of you put by him in store in measure as he has done well in business so that it may not be necessary to get money together when i come
 and when i come i will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to jerusalem
 and if it is possible for me to go there they will go with me
 but i will come to you after i have gone through macedonia for that is my purpose
 but i may be with you for a time or even for the winter so that you may see me on my way wherever i go
 for it is not my desire to see you now on my way because it is my hope to be with you for some time if that is the lords pleasure
 but i will be at ephesus till pentecost
 for a great and important door there is open to me and there are a number of people against me
 now if timothy comes see that he is with you without fear because he is doing the lords work even as i am
 see then that he has the honour which is right but send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am looking for him with the brothers
 but as for apollos the brother i had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers but it was not his pleasure to come now but he will come when he has a chance
 be on the watch unmoved in the faith and be strong like men
 let all you do be done in love
 now i make my request to you my brothers for you have knowledge that the house of stephanas is the first fruits of achaia and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints
 that you put yourselves under such and under everyone who is helping the lords work
 and i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for they have done what was needed to make your work complete
 for they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours for which cause give respect to such people
 the churches of asia send their love to you so do aquila and prisca with the church which is in their house
 all the brothers send their love to you give one another a holy kiss
 i paul send you these words of love in my writing
 if any man has not love for the lord let him be cursed maran atha  our lord comes 
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 my love be with you all in christ jesus so be it
 and when i came to you my brothers i did not come with wise words of knowledge putting before you the secret of god
 for i had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of jesus christ on the cross
 and i was with you without strength in fear and in doubt
 and in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom but i was dependent on the power of the spirit to make it clear to you
 so that your faith might be based not on mans wisdom but on the power of god
 but still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge though not the wisdom of this world and not of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing
