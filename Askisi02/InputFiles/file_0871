 and the lord said to moses how long will this people have no respect for me how long will they be without faith in the face of all the signs i have done among them
 i will send disease on them for their destruction and take away their heritage and i will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they
 and moses said to the lord then it will come to the ears of the egyptians for by your power you took this people out from among them
 and they will give the news to the people of this land they have had word that you lord are present with this people letting yourself be seen face to face and that your cloud is resting over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night
 now if you put to death all this people as one man then the nations who have had word of your glory will say
 because the lord was not able to take this people into the land which he made an oath to give them he sent destruction on them in the waste land
 so now may my prayer come before you and let the power of the lord be great as you said
 the lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy overlooking wrongdoing and evil and will not let wrongdoers go free sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers to the third and fourth generation
 may the sin of this people have forgiveness in the measure of your great mercy as you have had mercy on them from egypt up till now
 and the lord said i have had mercy as you say
 but truly as i am living and as all the earth will be full of the glory of the lord
 because all these men having seen my glory and the signs which i have done in egypt and in the waste land still have put me to the test ten times and have not given ear to my voice
 they will not see the land about which i made an oath to their fathers not one of these by whom i have not been honoured will see it
 but my servant caleb because he had a different spirit in him and has been true to me with all his heart him i will take into that land into which he went and his seed will have it for their heritage
 now the amalekites and the canaanites are in the valley tomorrow turning round go into the waste land by the way to the red sea
 then the lord said to moses and aaron
 how long am i to put up with this evil people and their outcries against me the words which they say against me have come to my ears
 say to them by my life says the lord as certainly as your words have come to my ears so certainly will i do this to you
 your dead bodies will be stretched out in this waste land and of all your number all those of twenty years old and over who have been crying out against me
 not one will come into the land which i gave my word you would have for your resting place but only caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
 and your little ones whom you said would come into strange hands i will take in and they will see the land which you would not have
 but as for you your dead bodies will be stretched in this waste land
 and your children will be wanderers in the waste land for forty years undergoing punishment for your false ways till your bodies become dust in the waste land
 and as you went through the land viewing it for forty days so for forty years a year for every day you will undergo punishment for your wrongdoing and you will see that i am against you
 i the lord have said it and this i will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me in this waste land destruction will come on them and death will be their fate
 and the men whom moses sent to see the land and who by the bad account they gave of the land were the cause of the outcry the people made against moses
 those same men who said evil of the land came to their death by disease before the lord
 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh of those who went to see the land were not touched by disease
 and when moses put these words before the children of israel the people were full of grief
 and early in the morning they got up and went to the top of the mountain saying we are here and we will go up to the place which the lord said he would give us for we have done wrong
