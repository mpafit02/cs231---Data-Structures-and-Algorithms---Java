 and it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom but in place of this he will make an agreement with him and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it but this will not take place or come about
 after this his face will be turned to the islands and he will take a number of them but a chief by his destruction will put an end to the shame offered by him and more than this he will make his shame come back on him
 then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land but his way will be stopped causing his downfall and he will not be seen again
 then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together but after a short time destruction will overtake him but not in wrath or in the fight
 and his place will be taken by a low person to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words
 and his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate
 and from the time when they make an agreement with him he will be working falsely for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force
 against fertile places and will make waste a part of the country and he will do what his fathers have not done or his fathers fathers he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force and of property he will even make designs against the strong places for a time
 and he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army but he will be forced to give way because of their designs against him
 and his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall and his army will come to complete destruction and a great number will be put to the sword
 and as for these two kings their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table but it will come to nothing for the end will be at the time fixed
 and he will go back to his land with great wealth and his heart will be against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land
 at the time fixed he will come back and come into the south but in the later time it will not be as it was before
 for those who go out from the west will come against him and he will be in fear and will go back full of wrath against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and he will go back and be united with those who have given up the holy agreement
 and armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place even the strong place and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear
 and those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words but the people who have knowledge of their god will be strong and do well
 and those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time
 now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help but numbers will be joined to them in the town and in their separate heritages
 and some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean till the time of the end for it is still for the fixed time
 and the king will do his pleasure he will put himself on high lifting himself over every god and saying things to be wondered at against the god of gods and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete for what has been purposed will be done
 he will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women he will have no respect for any god for he will put himself on high over all
 but in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired
 and he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people and will make division of the land for a price
 and at the time of the end the king of the south will make an attack on him and the king of the north will come against him like a storm wind with war carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships and he will go through many lands like overflowing waters
 and he will come into the beautiful land and tens of thousands will be overcome but these will be kept from falling into his hands edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon
 and his hand will be stretched out on the countries and the land of the south will not be safe from him
 but he will have power over the stores of gold and silver and over all the valued things of the south and the libyans and the ethiopians will be at his steps
 but he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north and he will go out in great wrath to send destruction on and put an end to great numbers
 he will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain but he will come to his end with no helper
 and at that time michael will take up his place the great angel who is the supporter of the children of your people and there will be a time of trouble such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that same time and at that time your people will be kept safe everyone who is recorded in the book
