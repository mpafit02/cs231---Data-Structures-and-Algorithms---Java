 and their answer will be because they were turned away from the lord their god who took their fathers out of the land of egypt they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why the lord has sent all this evil on them
 now at the end of twenty years in which time solomon had put up the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house
  hiram king of tyre had given solomon cedar trees and cypress trees and gold as much as he had need of  king solomon gave hiram twenty towns in the land of galilee
 but when hiram came from tyre to see the towns which solomon had given him he was not pleased with them
 and he said what sort of towns are these which you have given me my brother so they were named the land of cabul to this day
 and hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
 now this was the way of solomons system of forced work for the building of the lords house and of the kings house and the millo and the wall of jerusalem and megiddo and gezer 
 pharaoh king of egypt came and took gezer burning it down and putting to death the canaanites living in the town and he gave it for a bride offering to his daughter solomons wife 
  and solomon was the builder of gezer and beth horon the lower
 and baalath and tamar in the waste land in that land
 and all the store towns and the towns which solomon had for his war carriages and for his horsemen and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land under his rule
 as for the rest of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites who were not children of israel
 their children who were still in the land and whom the children of israel had not been able to put to complete destruction them did solomon put to forced work to this day
 but solomon did not put the children of israel to forced work they were the men of war his servants his captains and his chiefs captains of his war carriages and of his horsemen
 these were the chiefs of the overseers of solomons work five hundred and fifty in authority over the people who did the work
 at that time solomon made pharaohs daughter come up from the town of david to the house which he had made for her then he made the millo
 three times in the year it was solomons way to give burned offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had made to the lord causing his fire offering to go up on the altar before the lord
 and king solomon made a sea force of ships in ezion geber by eloth on the red sea in the land of edom
 hiram sent his servants who were experienced seamen in the sea force with solomons men
 and they came to ophir where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold and took it back to king solomon
 now there was a certain man of ramathaim a zuphite of the hill country of ephraim named elkanah he was the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephraimite
 and he had two wives one named hannah and the other peninnah and peninnah was the mother of children but hannah had no children
 now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the lord of armies in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there
 and when the day came for elkanah to make his offering he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters their part of the feast
 but to hannah he gave one part though hannah was very dear to him but the lord had not let her have children
 and the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy because the lord had not let her have children
 and year by year whenever she went up to the house of the lord she kept on attacking her so that hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food
 then her husband elkanah said to her hannah why are you weeping and why are you taking no food why is your heart troubled am i not more to you than ten sons
 so after they had taken food and wine in the guest room hannah got up now eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the temple of the lord
 and with grief in her soul weeping bitterly she made her prayer to the lord
