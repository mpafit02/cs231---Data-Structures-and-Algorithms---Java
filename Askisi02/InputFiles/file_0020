 if anyone has no care for his family and those in his house he is false to the faith and is worse than one who has no faith
 let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old and only if she has been the wife of one man
 and if witness is given of her good works if she has had the care of children if she has been kind to travellers washing the feet of the saints helping those who are in trouble giving herself to good works
 but to the younger widows say no for when their love is turned away from christ they have a desire to be married
 and they are judged because they have been false to their first faith
 and they get into the way of doing no work going about from house to house and not only doing no work but talking foolishly being over interested in the business of others saying things which they have no right to say
 so it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children controlling their families and giving the evil one no chance to say anything against them
 for even now some are turned away to satan
 if any woman of the faith has relations who are widows let her give them help so that the care of them does not come on the church and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed
 let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over specially those whose work is preaching and teaching
 for the writings say it is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it and the worker has a right to his reward
 do not take as true any statement made against one in authority but only if two or three give witness to it
 say sharp words to sinners when all are present so that the rest may be in fear
 i give you orders before god and christ jesus and the angels of gods selection to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another
 do not put hands on any man without thought and have no part in other mens sins keep yourself clean
 do not take only water as your drink but take a little wine for the good of your stomach and because you are frequently ill
 the sins of some men are clearly seen going before them to be judged but with others their sins go after them
 in the same way there are good works which are clearly seen and those which are not so may not be kept secret
 let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters so that no evil may be said against the name of god and his teaching
 and let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers working for them the more readily because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear give orders and teaching about these things
 if any man gives different teaching not in agreement with the true words of our lord jesus christ and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion
 he has an over high opinion of himself being without knowledge having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words from which come envy fighting cruel words evil thoughts
 bitter talk of men who being evil in mind and dead to what is true take the faith to be a way of making profit
 but true faith with peace of mind is of great profit
 for we came into the world with nothing and we are not able to take anything out
 but if we have food and a roof over us let that be enough
 but those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires through which men are overtaken by death and destruction
 for the love of money is a root of all evil and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows
 but you o man of god keep yourself from these things and go after righteousness religion faith love a quiet mind gentle behaviour
 be fighting the good fight of the faith take for yourself the life eternal for which you were marked out and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all
