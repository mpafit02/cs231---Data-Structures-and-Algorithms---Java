 and all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep
 but mary kept all these words in her heart and gave much thought to them
 then the keepers of the sheep went back giving glory and praise to god for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen as it had been said to them
 and when after eight days the time came for his circumcision he was named jesus the name which the angel had given to him before his birth
 and when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of moses had come to an end they took him to jerusalem to give him to the lord
  as it says in the law of the lord every mothers first male child is to be holy to the lord 
 and to make an offering as it is ordered in the law of the lord of two doves or other young birds
 and there was then in jerusalem a man whose name was simeon and he was an upright man fearing god and waiting for the comfort of israel and the holy spirit was on him
 and he had knowledge through the holy spirit that he would not see death till he had seen the lords christ
 and full of the spirit he came into the temple and when the father and mother came in with the child jesus to do with him what was ordered by the law
 then he took him in his arms and gave praise to god and said
 now you are letting your servant go in peace o lord as you have said
 for my eyes have seen your salvation
 which you have made ready before the face of all nations
 a light of revelation to the gentiles and the glory of your people israel
 and his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him
 and simeon gave them his blessing and said to mary his mother see this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in israel and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said
  and a sword will go through your heart  so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light
 and there was one anna a woman prophet the daughter of phanuel of the family of asher  she was very old and after seven years of married life
 she had been a widow for eighty four years  she was in the temple at all times worshipping with prayers and going without food night and day
 and coming up at that time she gave praise to god talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of jerusalem
 and when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the lord they went back to galilee to nazareth the town where they were living
 and the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom and the grace of god was on him
 and every year his father and mother went to jerusalem at the feast of the passover
 and when he was twelve years old they went up as their way was to the feast
 and when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back the boy jesus was still in jerusalem but they had no knowledge of it
 and in the belief that he was with some of their number they went a days journey and after looking for him among their relations and friends
 and seeing that he was not there they went back to jerusalem to make search for him
 and after three days they came across him in the temple seated among the wise men giving ear to their words and putting questions to them
 and all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave
