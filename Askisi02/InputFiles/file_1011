 i am the lord your god who took you up from the land of egypt let your mouth be open wide so that i may give you food
 but my people did not give ear to my voice israel would have nothing to do with me
 so i gave them up to the desires of their hearts that they might go after their evil purposes
 if only my people would give ear to me walking in my ways 
 i would quickly overcome their haters my hand would be turned against those who make war on them
 the haters of the lord would be broken and their destruction would be eternal
 i would give them the best grain for food you would be full of honey from the rock
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt god is in the meeting place of god he is judging among the gods
 how long will you go on judging falsely having respect for the persons of evil doers  selah 
 give ear to the cause of the poor and the children without fathers let those who are troubled and in need have their rights
 be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing take them out of the hand of the evil doers
 they have no knowledge or sense they go about in the dark all the bases of the earth are moved
 i said you are gods all of you are the sons of the most high
 but you will come to death like men falling like one of the rulers of the earth
 up  o god come as judge of the earth for all the nations are your heritage
 &lta song a psalm of asaph&gt o god do not keep quiet let your lips be open and take no rest o god
 for see  those who make war on you are out of control your haters are lifting up their heads
 they have made wise designs against your people talking together against those whom you keep in a secret place
 they have said come let us put an end to them as a nation so that the name of israel may go out of mans memory
 for they have all come to an agreement they are all joined together against you
 the tents of edom and the ishmaelites moab and the hagarites
 gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines and the people of tyre
 assur is joined with them they have become the support of the children of lot  selah 
 do to them what you did to the midianites what you did to sisera and jabin at the stream of kishon
 who came to destruction at en dor their bodies became dust and waste
 make their chiefs like oreb and zeeb and all their rulers like zebah and zalmunna
 who have said let us take for our heritage the resting place of god
 o my god make them like the rolling dust like dry stems before the wind
 as fire burning a wood and as a flame causing fire on the mountains
 so go after them with your strong wind and let them be full of fear because of your storm
