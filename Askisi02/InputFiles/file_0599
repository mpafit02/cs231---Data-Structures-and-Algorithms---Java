 and may god the ruler of all give you his blessing giving you fruit and increase so that you may become an army of peoples
 and may god give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your seed so that the land of your wanderings which god gave to abraham may be your heritage
 so isaac sent jacob away and he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the aramaean the brother of rebekah the mother of jacob and esau
 so when esau saw that isaac had given jacob his blessing and sent him away to paddan aram to get a wife for himself there blessing him and saying to him do not take a wife from among the women of canaan
 and that jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to paddan aram
 it was clear to esau that his father had no love for the women of canaan
 so esau went to ishmael and took mahalath the daughter of abrahams son ishmael the sister of nebaioth to be his wife in addition to the wives he had
 so jacob went out from beer sheba to go to haran
 and coming to a certain place he made it his resting place for the night for the sun had gone down and he took one of the stones which were there and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place
 and he had a dream and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven and the angels of god were going up and down on them
 and he saw the lord by his side saying i am the lord the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac i will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping
 your seed will be like the dust of the earth covering all the land to the west and to the east to the north and to the south you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
 and truly i will be with you and will keep you wherever you go guiding you back again to this land and i will not give you up till i have done what i have said to you
 and jacob awaking from his sleep said truly the lord is in this place and i was not conscious of it
 and fear came on him and he said this is a holy place this is nothing less than the house of god and the doorway of heaven
 and early in the morning jacob took the stone which had been under his head and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it
 and he gave that place the name of beth el but before that time the town was named luz
 then jacob took an oath and said if god will be with me and keep me safe on my journey and give me food and clothing to put on
 so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then i will take the lord to be my god
 and this stone which i have put up for a pillar will be gods house and of all you give me i will give a tenth part to you
 then jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the east
 and there he saw a water hole in a field and by the side of it three flocks of sheep for there they got water for the sheep and on the mouth of the water hole there was a great stone
 and all the flocks would come together there and when the stone had been rolled away they would give the sheep water and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water hole
 then jacob said to the herdmen my brothers where do you come from and they said from haran
 and he said to them have you any knowledge of laban the son of nahor and they said we have
 and he said to them is he well and they said he is well and here is rachel his daughter coming with the sheep
 then jacob said the sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together get water for the sheep and go and give them their food
 and they said we are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water hole then we will get water for the sheep
 while he was still talking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she took care of them
 then when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother coming with labans sheep he came near and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole he got water for labans flock
