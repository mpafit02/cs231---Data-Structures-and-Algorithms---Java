 pharaoh will see them and be comforted on account of all his people even pharaoh and all his army put to death by the sword says the lord
 for he put his fear in the land of the living and he will be put to rest among those without circumcision with those who have been put to death with the sword even pharaoh and all his people says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man give a word to the children of your people and say to them when i make the sword come on a land if the people of the land take a man from among their number and make him their watchman
 if when he sees the sword coming on the land by sounding the horn he gives the people news of their danger
 then anyone who hearing the sound of the horn does not take note of it will himself be responsible for his death if the sword comes and takes him away
 on hearing the sound of the horn he did not take note his blood will be on him for if he had taken note his life would have been safe
 but if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not give a note on the horn and the people have no word of the danger and the sword comes and takes any person from among them he will be taken away in his sin but i will make the watchman responsible for his blood
 so you son of man i have made you a watchman for the children of israel and you are to give ear to the word of my mouth and give them news from me of their danger
 when i say to the evil doer death will certainly overtake you and you say nothing to make clear to the evil doer the danger of his way death will overtake that evil man in his evil doing but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you make clear to the evil doer the danger of his way for the purpose of turning him from it and he is not turned from his way death will overtake him in his evil doing but your life will be safe
 and you son of man say to the children of israel you say our wrongdoing and our sins are on us and we are wasting away in them how then may we have life
 say to them by my life says the lord i have no pleasure in the death of the evil doer it is more pleasing to me if he is turned from his way and has life be turned be turned from your evil ways why are you looking for death o children of israel
 and you son of man say to the children of your people the righteousness of the upright man will not make him safe in the day when he does wrong and the evil doing of the evil man will not be the cause of his fall in the day when he is turned from his evil doing and the upright man will not have life because of his righteousness in the day when he does evil
 when i say to the upright that life will certainly be his if he puts his faith in his righteousness and does evil not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory but in the evil he has done death will overtake him
 and when i say to the evil doer death will certainly be your fate if he is turned from his sin and does what is ordered and right
 if the evil doer lets one who is in his debt have back what is his and gives back what he had taken by force and is guided by the rules of life doing no evil life will certainly be his death will not overtake him
 not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in mind against him he has done what is ordered and right life will certainly be his
 but the children of your people say the way of the lord is not equal when it is they whose way is not equal
 when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in it
 and when the evil man turning away from his evil doing does what is ordered and right he will get life by it
 and still you say the way of the lord is not equal o children of israel i will be your judge giving to everyone the reward of his ways
 now in the twelfth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the tenth month on the fifth day of the month one who had got away in flight from jerusalem came to me saying the town has been taken
 now the hand of the lord had been on me in the evening before the man who had got away came to me and he made my mouth open ready for his coming to me in the morning and my mouth was open and i was no longer without voice
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man those who are living in these waste places in the land of israel say abraham was but one and he had land for his heritage but we are a great number the land is given to us for our heritage
 for this cause say to them this is what the lord has said you take your meat with the blood your eyes are lifted up to your images and you are takers of life are you to have the land for your heritage
 you put your faith in your swords you do disgusting things everyone takes his neighbours wife are you to have the land for your heritage
 this is what you are to say to them the lord has said by my life truly those who are in the waste places will be put to the sword and him who is in the open field i will give to the beasts for their food and those who are in the strong places and in holes in the rocks will come to their death by disease
 and i will make the land a waste and a cause of wonder and the pride of her strength will come to an end and the mountains of israel will be made waste so that no one will go through
