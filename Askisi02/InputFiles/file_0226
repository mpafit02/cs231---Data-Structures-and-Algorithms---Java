 let there be no thought that i have come to put an end to the law or the prophets i have not come for destruction but to make complete
 truly i say to you till heaven and earth come to an end not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law till all things are done
 whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws teaching men to do the same will be named least in the kingdom of heaven but he who keeps the laws teaching others to keep them will be named great in the kingdom of heaven
 for i say to you if your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you will never go into the kingdom of heaven
 you have knowledge that it was said in old times you may not put to death and whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged
 but i say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged and he who says to his brother raca will be in danger from the sanhedrin and whoever says you foolish one will be in danger of the hell of fire
 if then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you
 while your offering is still before the altar first go and make peace with your brother then come and make your offering
 come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law while you are with him on the way for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison
 truly i say to you you will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing
 you have knowledge that it was said you may not have connection with another mans wife
 but i say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart
 and if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
 and if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
 again it was said whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose
 but i say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue makes her false to her husband and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away is no true husband to her
 again you have knowledge that it was said in old times do not take false oaths but give effect to your oaths to the lord
 but i say to you take no oaths at all not by the heaven because it is the seat of god
 or by the earth because it is the resting place for his foot or by jerusalem because it is the town of the great king
 you may not take an oath by your head because you are not able to make one hair white or black
 but let your words be simply yes or no and whatever is more than these is of the evil one
 you have knowledge that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
 but i say to you do not make use of force against an evil man but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned
 and if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat do not keep back your robe from him
 and whoever makes you go one mile go with him two
 give to him who comes with a request and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it
 you have knowledge that it was said have love for your neighbour and hate for him who is against you
 but i say to you have love for those who are against you and make prayer for those who are cruel to you
 so that you may be the sons of your father in heaven for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner
 for if you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you do not the tax farmers the same
