 and when they were not able to get them they took jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town crying these men who have made trouble all over the world have now come here
 whom jason has taken into his house and they are acting against the orders of caesar saying that there is another king jesus
 and hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled
 and having made jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace they let them go
 and the brothers straight away sent paul and silas away by night to beroea and they when they came there went to the synagogue of the jews
 now these were more noble than the jews of thessalonica for they gave serious attention to the word searching in the holy writings every day to see if these things were so
 and a number of them had faith and no small number of the greek women of high position and of the men
 but when the jews of thessalonica had news that paul was preaching the word at beroea they came there troubling the people and working them up
 so the brothers sent paul straight away to the sea but silas and timothy kept there still
 but those who went with paul took him as far as athens and then went away with orders from him to silas and timothy to come to him quickly
 now while paul was waiting for them at athens his spirit was troubled for he saw all the town full of images of the gods
 so he had discussions in the synagogue with the jews and god fearing gentiles and every day in the market place with those who were there
 and some of those who were supporters of the theories of the epicureans and the stoics had a meeting with him and some said what is this talker of foolish words saying and others he seems to be a preacher of strange gods because he was preaching of jesus and his coming back from the dead
 and they took him to mars hill saying will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours
 for you seem to us to say strange things and we have a desire to get the sense of them
  now all the athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new 
 and paul got to his feet on mars hill and said o men of athens i see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods
 for when i came by i was looking at the things to which you give worship and i saw an altar with this writing on it to the god of whom there is no knowledge now what you without knowledge give worship to i make clear to you
 the god who made the earth and everything in it he being lord of heaven and earth is not housed in buildings made with hands
 and he is not dependent on the work of mens hands as if he had need of anything for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things
 and he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth ordering their times and the limits of their lands
 so that they might make search for god in order if possible to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him though he is not far from every one of us
 for in him we have life and motion and existence as certain of your verse writers have said for we are his offspring
 if then we are the offspring of god it is not right for us to have the idea that god is like gold or silver or stone formed by the art or design of man
 those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by god but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart
 because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead
 now on hearing about the coming back from death some of them made sport of it but others said let us go more fully into this another time
 and so paul went away from among them
 but some men gave him their support among whom was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
 after these things he went away from athens and came to corinth
