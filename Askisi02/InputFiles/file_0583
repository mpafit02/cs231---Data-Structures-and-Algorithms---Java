 and travelling on from the south he came to beth el to the place where his tent had been before between beth el and ai
 to the place where he had made his first altar and there abram gave worship to the name of the lord
 and lot who went with him had flocks and herds and tents
 so that the land was not wide enough for the two of them their property was so great that there was not room for them together
 and there was an argument between the keepers of abrams cattle and the keepers of lots cattle at that time the canaanites and perizzites were still living in the land
 then abram said to lot let there be no argument between me and you and between my herdmen and your herdmen for we are brothers
 is not all the land before you then let us go our separate ways if you go to the left i will go to the right or if you take the right i will go to the left
 and lot lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of jordan saw that it was well watered everywhere before the lord had sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah it was like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt on the way to zoar
 so lot took for himself all the valley of jordan and went to the east and they were parted from one another
 abram went on living in the land of canaan and lot went to the lowland towns moving his tent as far as sodom
 now the men of sodom were evil and great sinners before the lord
 and the lord had said to abram after lot was parted from him from this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south to the east and to the west
 for all the land which you see i will give to you and to your seed for ever
 and i will make your children like the dust of the earth so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered then will your children be numbered
 come go through all the land from one end to the other for i will give it to you
 and abram moving his tent came and made his living place by the holy tree of mamre which is in hebron and made an altar there to the lord
 now in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim
 they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela  which is zoar 
 all these came together in the valley of siddim  which is the salt sea 
 for twelve years they were under the rule of chedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they put off his control
 and in the fourteenth year chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side overcame the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim
 and the horites in their mountain seir driving them as far as el paran which is near the waste land
 then they came back to en mishpat  which is kadesh  making waste all the country of the amalekites and of the amorites living in hazazon tamar
 and the king of sodom with the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela  that is zoar  went out and put their forces in position in the valley of siddim
 against chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five
 now the valley of siddim was full of holes of sticky earth and the kings of sodom and gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there but the rest got away to the mountain
 and the four kings took all the goods and food from sodom and gomorrah and went on their way
 and in addition they took lot abrams brothers son who was living in sodom and all his goods
 and one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to abram the hebrew who was living by the holy tree of mamre the amorite the brother of eshcol and aner who were friends of abram
 and abram hearing that his brothers son had been made a prisoner took a band of his trained men three hundred and eighteen of them sons of his house and went after them as far as dan
