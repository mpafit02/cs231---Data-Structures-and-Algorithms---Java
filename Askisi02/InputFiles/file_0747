 for i was looking for good and evil came i was waiting for light and it became dark
 my feelings are strongly moved and give me no rest days of trouble have overtaken me
 i go about in dark clothing uncomforted i get up in the public place crying out for help
 i have become a brother to the jackals and go about in the company of ostriches
 my skin is black and dropping off me and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease
 and my music has been turned to sorrow and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping
 i made an agreement with my eyes how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin
 for what is gods reward from on high or the heritage given by the ruler of all from heaven
 is it not trouble for the sinner and destruction for the evil doers
 does he not see my ways and are not my steps all numbered
 if i have gone in false ways or my foot has been quick in working deceit
  let me be measured in upright scales and let god see my righteousness 
 if my steps have been turned out of the way or if my heart went after my eyes or if the property of another is in my hands
 let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it and let my produce be uprooted
 if my heart went after another mans wife or if i was waiting secretly at my neighbours door
 then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body
 for that would be a crime it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges
 it would be a fire burning even to destruction and taking away all my produce
 if i did wrong in the cause of my man servant or my woman servant when they went to law with me
 what then will i do when god comes as my judge and what answer may i give to his questions
 did not god make him as well as me did he not give us life in our mothers bodies
 if i kept back the desire of the poor if the widows eye was looking for help to no purpose
 if i kept my food for myself and did not give some of it to the child with no father
  for i was cared for by god as by a father from my earliest days he was my guide from the body of my mother 
 if i saw one near to death for need of clothing and that the poor had nothing covering him
 if his back did not give me a blessing and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm
 if my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong when i saw that i was supported by the judges
 may my arm be pulled from my body and be broken from its base
 for the fear of god kept me back and because of his power i might not do such things
 if i made gold my hope or if i ever said to the best gold i have put my faith in you
