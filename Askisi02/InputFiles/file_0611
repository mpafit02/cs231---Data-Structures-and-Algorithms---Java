 now when reuben came back to the hole joseph was not there and giving signs of grief
 he went back to his brothers and said the child is gone what am i to do
 then they took josephs coat and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death
 and they took the coat to their father and said we came across this is it your sons coat or not
 and he saw that it was and said it is my sons coat an evil beast has put him to death without doubt joseph has come to a cruel end
 then jacob giving signs of grief put on haircloth and went on weeping for his son day after day
 and all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort but he would not be comforted saying with weeping i will go down to the underworld to my son so great was his fathers sorrow for him
 and in egypt the men of midian gave him for a price to potiphar a captain of high position in pharaohs house
 now at that time judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of adullam named hirah
 and there he saw the daughter of a certain man of canaan named shua and took her as his wife
 and she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name er
 and again she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name onan
 then she had another son to whom she gave the name shelah she was at chezib when the birth took place
 and judah took a wife for his first son er and her name was tamar
 now er judahs first son did evil in the eyes of the lord so that he put him to death
 then judah said to onan go in to your brothers wife and do what it is right for a husbands brother to do make her your wife and get offspring for your brother
 but onan seeing that the offspring would not be his went in to his brothers wife but let his seed go on to the earth so that he might not get offspring for his brother
 and what he did was evil in the eyes of the lord so that he put him to death like his brother
 then judah said to tamar his daughter in law go back to your fathers house and keep yourself as a widow till my son shelah becomes a man for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers so tamar went back to her fathers house
 and after a time bath shua judahs wife came to her end and after judah was comforted for her loss he went to timnah where they were cutting the wool of his sheep and his friend hirah of adullam went with him
 and when tamar had news that her father in law was going up to timnah to the wool cutting
 she took off her widows clothing and covering herself with her veil she took her seat near enaim on the road to timnah for she saw that shelah was now a man but she had not been made his wife
 when judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town because her face was covered
 and turning to her by the roadside he said to her let me come in to you for he had no idea that she was his daughter in law and she said what will you give me as my price
 and he said i will give you a young goat from the flock and she said what will you give me as a sign till you send it
 and he said what would you have and she said your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand so he gave them to her and went in to her and she became with child by him
 then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widows clothing
 then judah sent his friend hirah with the young goat to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman but she was not there
 and he put questions to the men of the place saying where is the loose woman who was in enaim by the wayside and they said there was no such woman there
 so he went back to judah and said i have not seen her and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there
