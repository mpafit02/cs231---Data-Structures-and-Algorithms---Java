 it is not good to have respect for a mans position for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread
 he who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money and does not see that need will come on him
 he who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue
 he who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right and says it is no sin is the same as a taker of life
 he who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting but he who puts his faith in the lord will be made fat
 he whose faith is in himself is foolish but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe
 he who gives to the poor will never be in need but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them
 when evil doers are lifted up men take cover but when destruction overtakes them the upright are increased
 a man hating sharp words and making his heart hard will suddenly be broken and will not be made well again
 when the upright have power the people are glad when an evil man is ruler grief comes on the people
 a man who is a lover of wisdom is a joy to his father but he who goes in the company of loose women is a waster of wealth
 a king by right rule makes the land safe but one full of desires makes it a waste
 a man who says smooth things to his neighbour is stretching out a net for his steps
 in the steps of an evil man there is a net for him but the upright man gets away quickly and is glad
 the upright man gives attention to the cause of the poor the evil doer gives no thought to it
 men of pride are the cause of violent acts in a town but by wise men wrath is turned away
 if a wise man goes to law with a foolish man he may be angry or laughing but there will be no rest
 men of blood are haters of the good man and evil doers go after his soul
 a foolish man lets out all his wrath but a wise man keeps it back quietly
 if a ruler gives attention to false words all his servants are evil doers
 the poor man and his creditor come face to face the lord gives light to their eyes equally
 the king who is a true judge in the cause of the poor will be safe for ever on the seat of his power
 the rod and sharp words give wisdom but a child who is not guided is a cause of shame to his mother
 when evil men are in power wrongdoing is increased but the upright will have pleasure when they see their downfall
 give your son training and he will give you rest he will give delight to your soul
 where there is no vision the people are uncontrolled but he who keeps the law will be happy
 a servant will not be trained by words for though the sense of the words is clear to him he will not give attention
 have you seen a man who is quick with his tongue there is more hope for a foolish man than for him
 if a servant is gently cared for from his early years he will become a cause of sorrow in the end
 an angry man is the cause of fighting and a man given to wrath does much wrong
