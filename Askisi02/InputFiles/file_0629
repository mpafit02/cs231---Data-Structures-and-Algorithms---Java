 go out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and your sons wives
 take out with you every living thing which is with you birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth
 and noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons wives
 and every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth went out of the ark
 and noah made an altar to the lord and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar
 and when the sweet smell came up to the lord he said in his heart i will not again put a curse on the earth because of man for the thoughts of mans heart are evil from his earliest days never again will i send destruction on all living things as i have done
 while the earth goes on seed time and the getting in of the grain cold and heat summer and winter day and night will not come to an end
 and god gave his blessing to noah and his sons and said be fertile and have increase and make the earth full
 and the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air everything which goes on the land and all the fishes of the sea are given into your hands
 every living and moving thing will be food for you i give them all to you as before i gave you all green things
 but flesh with the life blood in it you may not take for food
 and for your blood which is your life will i take payment from every beast i will take it and from every man will i take payment for the blood of his brother man
 whoever takes a mans life by man will his life be taken because god made man in his image
 and now be fertile and have increase have offspring on the earth and become great in number
 and god said to noah and to his sons
 truly i will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you
 and with every living thing with you all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you
 and i will make my agreement with you never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction
 and god said this is the sign of the agreement which i make between me and you and every living thing with you for all future generations
 i will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth
 and whenever i make a cloud come over the earth the bow will be seen in the cloud
 and i will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh
 and the bow will be in the cloud and looking on it i will keep in mind the eternal agreement between god and every living thing on the earth
 and god said to noah this is the sign of the agreement which i have made between me and all flesh on the earth
 and the sons of noah who went out of the ark were shem ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
 these three were the sons of noah and from them all the earth was peopled
 in those days noah became a farmer and he made a vine garden
 and he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink and he was uncovered in his tent
 and ham the father of canaan saw his father unclothed and gave news of it to his two brothers outside
 and shem and japheth took a robe and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed
