 in answer they said to him our father is abraham jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would do what abraham did
 but now you have a desire to put me to death a man who has said to you what is true as i had it from god abraham did not do that
 you are doing the works of your father they said to him we are true sons of abraham we have one father who is god
 jesus said to them if god was your father you would have love for me because it was from god i came and am here i did not come of myself but he sent me
 why are my words not clear to you it is because your ears are shut to my teaching
 you are the children of your father the evil one and it is your pleasure to do his desires from the first he was a taker of life and he did not go in the true way because there is no true thing in him when he says what is false it is natural to him for he is false and the father of what is false
 but because i say what is true you have no belief in me
 which of you is able truly to say that i am a sinner if i say what is true why have you no belief in me
 he who is a child of god gives ear to the words of god your ears are not open to them because you are not from god
 the jews said to him in answer are we not right in saying that you are of samaria and have an evil spirit
 and this was the answer of jesus i have not an evil spirit but i give honour to my father and you do not give honour to me
 i however am not in search of glory for myself there is one who is searching for it and he is judge
 truly i say to you if a man keeps my word he will never see death
 the jews said to him now we are certain that you have an evil spirit abraham is dead and the prophets are dead and you say if a man keeps my word he will never see death
 are you greater than our father abraham who is dead and the prophets are dead who do you say that you are
 jesus said in answer if i take glory for myself my glory is nothing it is my father who gives me glory of whom you say that he is your god
 you have no knowledge of him but i have knowledge of him and if i said i have no knowledge of him i would be talking falsely like you but i have full knowledge of him and i keep his word
 your father abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day he saw it and was glad
 then the jews said to him you are not fifty years old have you seen abraham
 jesus said to them truly i say to you before abraham came into being i am
 so they took up stones to send at him but jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the temple
 and when he went on his way he saw a man blind from birth
 and his disciples put a question to him saying master was it because of this mans sin or the sin of his father and mother that he has been blind from birth
 jesus said in answer it was not because of his sin or because of his fathers or mothers it was so that the works of god might be seen openly in him
 while it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me the night comes when no work may be done
 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
 having said these words he put earth mixed with water from his mouth on the mans eyes
 and said to him go and make yourself clean in the bath of siloam  the sense of the name is sent  so he went away and after washing came back able to see
 then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street with his hand out for money said is not this the man who got money from people
 some said it is he others said no but he is like him he said i am he
