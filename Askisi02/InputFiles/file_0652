 for the strong town is without men an unpeopled living place and she has become a waste land there the young ox will take his rest and its branches will be food for him
 when its branches are dry they will be broken off the women will come and put fire to them for it is a foolish people for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them and he whose work they are will not have pity on them
 and it will be in that day that the lord will get together his grain from the river to the stream of egypt and you will be got together with care o children of israel
 and it will be in that day that a great horn will be sounded and those who were wandering in the land of assyria and those who had been sent away into the land of egypt will come and they will give worship to the lord in the holy mountain at jerusalem
 ho  crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in ephraim and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of those who are overcome by strong drink 
 see the lord has a strong and cruel one like a rain of ice a storm of destruction like the overflowing of a strong river he will violently overcome them
 the crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in ephraim will be crushed under foot
 and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of the fertile valley will be like the first early fruit before the summer which a man takes and puts in his mouth the minute he sees it
 in that day will the lord of armies be a crown of glory and a fair ornament to the rest of his people
 and a spirit of wisdom to the judge and strength to those who keep back the attackers at the door of the town
 and further these are uncertain through wine and have gone out of the right way through strong drink the priest and the prophet are uncertain through strong drink they are overcome by wine they have gone out of the way through strong drink their vision is false they go wrong in their decisions
 for all the tables are covered with coughed up food so that there is not a clean place
 to whom will he give knowledge and to whom will he make clear the word will it be to those who have newly given up milk and who have only now been taken from the breast
 for it is one rule after another one line after another here a little there a little
 no but with broken talk and with a strange tongue he will give his word to this people
 to whom he said this is the rest give rest to him who is tired and by this you may get new strength but they would not give ear
 for this cause the word of the lord will be to them rule after rule line after line here a little there a little so that they may go on their way and falling back may be broken and taken in the net
 give ear then to the word of the lord you men of pride the rulers of this people in jerusalem
 because you have said we have made death our friend and with the underworld we have made an agreement when the overflowing waters come through they will not come near us for we are looking to false words for help taking cover in what is untrue
 for this cause says the lord god see i am placing in zion as a base a stone a tested stone an angle stone which is certain and of great value and he who has faith will not give way
 and i will make right decision the measuring line and righteousness the weight and the ice storm will take away the safe place of false words and the secret place will be covered by the flowing waters
 and the help you were looking for from death will come to nothing and your agreement with the underworld will be broken when the overflowing waters come through then you will be overcome by them
 whenever they come through they will overtake you for they will come through morning after morning by day and by night and the news will be nothing but fear
 for the bed is not long enough for a man to be stretched out on and the cover is not wide enough for him to be covered with
 for the lord will come up as on mount perazim he will be moved to wrath as in the valley of gibeon so that he may do his work  strange is his work and give effect to his act  unnatural is his act
 and now take care that you do not make sport of him or your bands will be made strong for i have had word from the lord the lord of armies of an end of a complete end which is to come on all the land
 let your ears be open to my voice give attention to what i say
 is the ploughman for ever ploughing does he not get the earth ready and broken up for the seed
 when the face of the earth has been levelled does he not put in the different sorts of seed and the grain in lines and the barley in its place and the spelt at the edge
 for his god is his teacher giving him the knowledge of these things
