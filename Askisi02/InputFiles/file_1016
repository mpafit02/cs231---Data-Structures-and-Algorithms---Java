 the bitter words of your haters o lord shaming the footsteps of your king
 let the lord be praised for ever so be it so be it
 &ltto the chief music maker on muthlabben a psalm of david&gt i will give you praise o lord with all my heart i will make clear all the wonder of your works
 i will be glad and have delight in you i will make a song of praise to your name o most high
 when my haters are turned back they will be broken and overcome before you
 for you gave approval to my right and my cause you were seated in your high place judging in righteousness
 you have said sharp words to the nations you have sent destruction on the sinners you have put an end to their name for ever and ever
 you have given their towns to destruction the memory of them has gone they have become waste for ever
 but the lord is king for ever he has made ready his high seat for judging
 and he will be the judge of the world in righteousness giving true decisions for the peoples
 the lord will be a high tower for those who are crushed down a high tower in times of trouble
 and those who have knowledge of your name will put their faith in you because you lord have ever given your help to those who were waiting for you
 make songs of praise to the lord whose house is in zion make his doings clear to the people
 when he makes search for blood he has them in his memory he is not without thought for the cry of the poor
 have mercy on me o lord and see how i am troubled by my haters let me be lifted up from the doors of death
 so that i may make clear all your praise in the house of the daughter of zion i will be glad because of your salvation
 the nations have gone down into the hole which they made in their secret net is their foot taken
 the lord has given knowledge of himself through his judging the evil doer is taken in the net which his hands had made  higgaion selah 
 the sinners and all the nations who have no memory of god will be turned into the underworld
 for the poor will not be without help the hopes of those in need will not be crushed for ever
 up  o lord let not man overcome you let the nations be judged before you
 put them in fear o lord so that the nations may see that they are only men  selah 
 &lta prayer of moses the man of god&gt lord you have been our resting place in all generations
 before the mountains were made before you had given birth to the earth and the world before time was and for ever you are god
 you send man back to his dust and say go back you children of men
 for to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past and like a watch in the night
 
 in the morning it is green in the evening it is cut down and becomes dry
 we are burned up by the heat of your passion and troubled by your wrath
 you have put our evil doings before you our secret sins in the light of your face
