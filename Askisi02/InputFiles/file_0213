 and he says to him friend how came you in here not having a guests robe and he had nothing to say
 then the king said to the servants put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 for out of all to whom the good news has come only a small number will get salvation
 then the pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him
 and they sent to him their disciples with the herodians saying master we see that you are true and that you are teaching the true way of god and have no fear of anyone because you have no respect for a mans position
 give us then your opinion of this is it right to give tax to caesar or not
 but jesus saw their trick and said oh false ones why are you attempting to put me in the wrong
 let me see the tax money and they gave him a penny
 and he said to them whose is this image and name on it
 they say to him caesars then he said to them give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods
 and hearing it they were full of wonder and went away from him
 on the same day there came to him the sadducees who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying

 and last of all the woman came to her end
 when they come back from the dead then whose wife will she be of the seven because they all had her

 for when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives but they are as the angels in heaven
 but about the dead coming back to life have you no knowledge of what was said to you by god in the writings
 i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
 and the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching
 but the pharisees hearing how the mouths of the sadducees had been stopped came together
 and one of them a teacher of the law put a question to him testing him and saying
 master which is the chief rule in the law
 and he said to him have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
 this is the first and greatest rule
 and a second like it is this have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 on these two rules all the law and the prophets are based
 now while the pharisees were together jesus put a question to them saying
