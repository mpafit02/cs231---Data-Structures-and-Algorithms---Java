 and after the birth of noah lamech went on living for five hundred and ninety five years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of lamechs life were seven hundred and seventy seven and he came to his end
 and when noah was five hundred years old he became the father of shem ham and japheth
 and joseph put his head down on his fathers face weeping and kissing him
 and joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge to make his fathers body ready folding it in linen with spices and they did so
 and the forty days needed for making the body ready went by and there was weeping for him among the egyptians for seventy days
 and when the days of weeping for him were past joseph said to the servants of pharaoh if now you have love for me say these words to pharaoh
 my father made me take an oath saying when i am dead put me to rest in the place i have made ready for myself in the land of canaan so now let me go and put my father in his last resting place and i will come back again
 and pharaoh said go up and put your father to rest as you gave your oath to him
 so joseph went up to put his father in his last resting place and with him went all the servants of pharaoh and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of egypt
 and all the family of joseph and his brothers and his fathers people only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of goshen
 and carriages went up with him and horsemen a great army
 and they came to the grain floor of atad on the other side of jordan and there they gave the last honours to jacob with great and bitter sorrow weeping for their father for seven days
 and when the people of the land the people of canaan at the grain floor of atad saw their grief they said great is the grief of the egyptians so the place was named abel mizraim on the other side of jordan
 so his sons did as he had given them orders to do
 for they took him into the land of canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of machpelah which abraham got with the field for a resting place from ephron the hittite at mamre
 and when his father had been put to rest joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him went back to egypt
 now after the death of their father josephs brothers said to themselves it may be that josephs heart will be turned against us and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him
 so they sent word to joseph saying your father before his death gave us orders saying
 you are to say to joseph let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked and the evil they did to you now if it is your pleasure let the sin of the servants of your fathers god have forgiveness and at these words joseph was overcome with weeping
 then his brothers went and falling at his feet said truly we are your servants
 and joseph said have no fear am i in the place of god
 as for you it was in your mind to do me evil but god has given a happy outcome the salvation of numbers of people as you see today
 so now have no fear for i will take care of you and your little ones so he gave them comfort with kind words
 now joseph and all his fathers family went on living in egypt and the years of josephs life were a hundred and ten
 and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation and the children of machir the son of manasseh came to birth on josephs knees
 then joseph said to his brothers the time of my death has come but god will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to abraham and isaac and jacob
 then joseph made the children of israel take an oath saying god will certainly give effect to his word and you are to take my bones away from here
 so joseph came to his death being a hundred and ten years old and they made his body ready and he was put in a chest in egypt
 and after a time when men were increasing on the earth and had daughters
