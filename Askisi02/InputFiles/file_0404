 now in the morning david gave uriah a letter to take to joab
 and in the letter he said take care to put uriah in the very front of the line where the fighting is most violent and go back from him so that he may be overcome and put to death
 so while joab was watching the town he put uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were
 and the men of the town went out and had a fight with joab and a number of davids men came to their death in the fight and with them uriah the hittite
 then joab sent david news of everything which had taken place in the war
 and he gave orders to the man who took the news saying after you have given the king all the news about the war
 if the king is angry and says why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall
 who put abimelech the son of jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at thebez why did you go so near the wall then say to him your servant uriah the hittite is among the dead
 so the man went and came to david and gave him all the news which joab had sent him to give then david was angry with joab and said why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall who put abimelech the son of jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at thebez why did you go so near the wall
 and the man said to david truly the men got the better of us and came out against us into the open country but we sent them back to the very doors of the town
 and the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall and some of the kings servants are dead and among them is your servant uriah the hittite
 then david said to the man go and say to joab do not let this be a grief to you for one man may come to his death by the sword like another put up an even stronger fight against the town and take it and do you put heart into him
 and when the wife of uriah had news that her husband was dead she gave herself up to weeping for him
 and when the days of weeping were past david sent for her and took her into his house and she became his wife and gave him a son but the lord was not pleased with the thing david had done
 and the lord sent nathan to david and nathan came to him and said there were two men in the same town one a man of great wealth and the other a poor man
 the man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds
 but the poor man had only one little she lamb which he had got and taken care of from its birth it had been with him like one of his children his meat was its food and from his cup it took its drink resting in his arms and it was like a daughter to him
 now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him but he took the poor mans lamb and made it ready for the man who had come
 and david was full of wrath against that man and he said to nathan by the living lord death is the right punishment for the man who has done this
 and he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb because he has done this and because he had no pity
 and nathan said to david you are that man the lord god of israel says i made you king over israel putting holy oil on you and i kept you safe from the hands of saul
 i gave you your masters daughter and your masters wives for yourself and i gave you the daughters of israel and judah and if that had not been enough i would have given you such and such things
 why then have you had no respect for the word of the lord doing what is evil in his eyes you have put uriah the hittite to death with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife you have put him to death with the sword of the children of ammon
 so now the sword will never be turned away from your family because you have had no respect for me and have taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be your wife
 the lord says from those of your family i will send evil against you and before your very eyes i will take your wives and give them to your neighbour and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun
 you did it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and in the light of the sun
 and david said to nathan great is my sin against the lord and nathan said to david the lord has put away your sin death will not come on you
 but still because you have had no respect for the lord death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth
 then nathan went back to his house and the hand of the lord was on davids son the child of uriahs wife and it became very ill
 so david made prayer to god for the child and he took no food day after day and went in and stretching himself out on the earth was there all night
