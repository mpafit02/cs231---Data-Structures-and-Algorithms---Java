 the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were fair and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them
 and the lord said my spirit will not be in man for ever for he is only flesh so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years
 there were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days and after that when the sons of god had connection with the daughters of men they gave birth to children these were the great men of old days the men of great name
 and the lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil
 and the lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth and grief was in his heart
 and the lord said i will take away man whom i have made from the face of the earth even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air for i have sorrow for having made them
 but noah had grace in the eyes of god
 these are the generations of noah noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation he went in the ways of god
 and noah had three sons shem ham and japheth
 and the earth was evil in gods eyes and full of violent ways
 and god looking on the earth saw that it was evil for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth
 and god said to noah the end of all flesh has come the earth is full of their violent doings and now i will put an end to them with the earth
 make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it and make it safe from the water inside and out
 and this is the way you are to make it it is to be three hundred cubits long fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
 you are to put a window in the ark a cubit from the roof and a door in the side of it and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors
 for truly i will send a great flow of waters over the earth for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life everything on the earth will come to an end
 but with you i will make an agreement and you will come into the ark you and your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you
 and you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing and keep them safe with you they will be male and female
 two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction
 and make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them
 and all these things noah did as god said so he did
 and the lord said to noah take all your family and go into the ark for you only in this generation have i seen to be upright
 of every clean beast you will take seven males and seven females and of the beasts which are not clean two the male and his female
 and of the birds of the air seven males and seven females so that their seed may still be living on the face of the earth
 for after seven days i will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights for the destruction of every living thing which i have made on the face of the earth
 and noah did everything which the lord said he was to do
 and noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth
 and noah with his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters
 of clean beasts and of beasts which are not clean and of birds and of everything which goes on the earth
 in twos male and female they went into the ark with noah as god had said
