 let the fear of the lord your god be in your hearts and be his servants taking your oaths by his name
 do not go after other gods the gods of the peoples round about you
 for the lord your god who is with you is a god who will not let his honour be given to another or the wrath of the lord will be burning against you causing your destruction from the face of the earth
 do not put the lord your god to the test as you did in massah
 keep with care the orders of the lord your god and his rules and his laws which he has given you
 and do what is upright and good in the eyes of the lord your god so that it may be well for you and you may go in and take for your heritage that good land from which the lord undertook by an oath to your fathers
 to send out from before you all those who are against you
 and when your son says to you in time to come what is the reason for these rules and laws and decisions which the lord our god has given you
 then you will say to your son we were servants under pharaohs yoke in egypt and the lord took us out of egypt with a strong hand
 and the lord did great signs and wonders against egypt and against pharaoh and all his house before our eyes
 and he took us out from that place guiding us here to give us this land as he said in his oath to our fathers
 and the lord gave us orders to keep all these laws in the fear of the lord our god so that it might be well for us for ever and that he might keep us from death as he has done to this day
 and it will be our righteousness if we take care to keep all this order before the lord our god as he has given it to us
 when the lord your god takes you into the land where you are going which is to be your heritage and has sent out the nations before you the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and stronger than you
 and when the lord has given them up into your hands and you have overcome them give them up to complete destruction make no agreement with them and have no mercy on them
 do not take wives or husbands from among them do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons
 for through them your sons will be turned from me to the worship of other gods and the lord will be moved to wrath against you and send destruction on you quickly
 but this is what you are to do to them their altars are to be pulled down and their pillars broken and their holy trees cut down and their images burned with fire
 for you are a holy people to the lord your god marked out by the lord your god to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth
 the lord did not give you his love or take you for himself because you were more in number than any other people for you were the smallest of the nations
 but because of his love for you and in order to keep his oath to your fathers the lord took you out with the strength of his hand making you free from the prison house and from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
 be certain then that the lord your god is god whose faith and mercy are unchanging who keeps his word through a thousand generations to those who have love for him and keep his laws
 rewarding his haters to their face with destruction he will have no mercy on his hater but will give him open punishment
 so keep the orders and the laws and the decisions which i give you today and do them
 and it will be that if you give attention to these decisions and keep and do them then the lord will keep his agreement with you and his mercy as he said in his oath to your fathers
 and he will give you his love blessing you and increasing you he will send his blessing on the offspring of your body and the fruit of your land your grain and your wine and your oil the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock in the land which by his oath to your fathers he undertook to give you
 you will have greater blessings than any other people no male or female among you or among your cattle will be without offspring
 and the lord will take away from you all disease and will not put on you any of the evil diseases of egypt which you have seen but will put them on your haters
 and you are to send destruction on all the peoples which the lord your god gives into your hands have no pity on them and do not give worship to their gods for that will be a cause of sin to you
 if you say in your hearts these nations are greater in number than we are how are we to take their land from them
