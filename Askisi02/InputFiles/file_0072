 but peter and the apostles answering said we have to do the orders of god not of man
 the god of our fathers gave jesus back to life whom you had put to death hanging him on a tree
 him god has put on high at his right hand as a ruler and a saviour to give to israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins
 and we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who keep his laws
 but when these words came to their ears they were cut to the heart and had a mind to put them to death
 but one of the sanhedrin a pharisee named gamaliel a man of learning in the law of whom all the people had a high opinion got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time
 and he said to them men of israel take care what you do about these men
 for before this there was theudas who said he was someone important to whom about four hundred men gave their support he was put to death and his band was broken up and came to nothing
 after this man there was judas of galilee at the time of the numbering and some of the people went after him he was put to death and all his supporters were put to flight
 and now i say to you do nothing to these men but let them be for if this teaching or this work is of men it will come to nothing
 but if it is of god you will not be able to overcome them and you are in danger of fighting against god
 and he seemed to them to be right and they sent for the apostles and after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of jesus they let them go
 so they went away from the sanhedrin happy to undergo shame for the name
 and every day in the temple and privately they went on teaching and preaching jesus as the christ
 now in those days when the number of the disciples was increasing protests were made by the greek jews against the hebrews because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day
 and the apostles sent for all the disciples and said it is not right for us to give up preaching the word of god in order to make distribution of food
 take then from among you seven men of good name full of the spirit and of wisdom to whom we may give control of this business
 then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word
 and this saying was pleasing to all of them and they made selection of stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas of antioch who had become a jew
 these they took to the apostles who after prayer put their hands on them
 and the word of god was increasing in power and the number of the disciples in jerusalem became very great and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith
 and stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people
 but some of those who were of the synagogue named that of the libertines and some of the men of cyrene and of alexandria and those from cilicia and asia had arguments with stephen
 but they were not able to get the better of him for his words were full of wisdom and of the spirit
 then they got men to say he has said evil against moses and against god in our hearing
 and the people with the rulers and the scribes were moved against him and they came and took him before the sanhedrin
 and they got false witnesses who said this man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law
 for he has said in our hearing that this jesus of nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by moses
 and all those who were in the sanhedrin looking at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel
 then the high priest said are these things true
