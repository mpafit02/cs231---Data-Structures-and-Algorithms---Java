 then elijah said to him come no farther for the lord has sent me to jordan but he said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went on together
 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off while the two of them were by the edge of jordan
 then elijah took off his robe and rolling it up gave the water a blow with it and the waters were parted flowing back this way and that so that they went over on dry land
 and when they had come to the other side elijah said to elisha say what you would have me do for you before i am taken from you and elisha said be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me
 and he said you have made a hard request still if you see me when i am taken from you you will get your desire but if not it will not be so
 and while they went on their way going on talking together suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and elijah went up to heaven in a great wind
 and when elisha saw it he gave a cry my father my father the carriages of israel and its horsemen  and he saw him no longer and he was full of grief
 then he took up elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and went back till he came to the edge of jordan
 and he took elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and giving the water a blow with it said where is the lord the god of elijah and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that and elisha went over
 and when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah is resting on elisha and they came out to him and went down on the earth before him
 and they said your servants have with us here fifty strong men be pleased to let them go in search of elijah for it may be that the spirit of the lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley but he said do not send them
 but when they kept on requesting him he was shamed and said send then so they sent fifty men but after searching for three days they came back without having seen him
 and they came back to him while he was still at jericho and he said to them did i not say to you go not
 now the men of the town said to elisha you see that the position of this town is good but the water is bad causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead
 so he said get me a new vessel and put salt in it and they took it to him
 then he went out to the spring from which the water came and put salt in it and said the lord says now i have made this water sweet no longer will it be death giving or unfertile
 and the water was made sweet again to this day as elisha said
 then from there he went up to beth el and on his way some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him crying go up old no hair  go up old no hair 
 and turning back he saw them and put a curse on them in the name of the lord and two she bears came out of the wood and put forty two of the children to death
 from there he went to mount carmel and came back from there to samaria
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said to him the lord says put your house in order for your death is near
 then turning his face to the wall he made his prayer to the lord saying
 o lord keep in mind how i have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
 now before isaiah had gone out of the middle of the town the word of the lord came to him saying
 go back and say to hezekiah the ruler of my people the lord the god of david your father says your prayer has come to my ears and i have seen your weeping see i will make you well on the third day you will go up to the house of the lord
 i will give you fifteen more years of life and i will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of assyria i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 then isaiah said take a cake of figs so they took it and put it on his wound and he got better
 and hezekiah said to isaiah what is to be the sign that the lord will make me well and that i will go up to the house of the lord on the third day
 and isaiah said this is the sign the lord will give you that he will do what he has said will the shade go forward ten degrees or back
 and hezekiah said in answer it is a simple thing for the shade to go forward but let it go back ten degrees
