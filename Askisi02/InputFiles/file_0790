 so he kept them safe from the children of israel and did not let them be put to death
 and that day joshua made them servants cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the lord in the place marked out by him to this day
 now after the death of joshua the children of israel made request to the lord saying who is to go up first to make war for us against the canaanites
 and the lord said judah is to go up see i have given the land into his hands
 then judah said to simeon his brother come up with me into my heritage so that we may make war against the canaanites and i will then go with you into your heritage so simeon went with him
 and judah went up and the lord gave the canaanites and the perizzites into their hands and they overcame ten thousand of them in bezek
 and they came across adoni zedek and made war on him and they overcame the canaanites and the perizzites
 but adoni zedek went in flight and they went after him and overtook him and had his thumbs and his great toes cut off
 and adoni zedek said seventy kings whose thumbs and great toes had been cut off got broken meat under my table as i have done so has god done to me in full and they took him to jerusalem and he came to his end there
 then the children of judah made an attack on jerusalem and took it burning down the town after they had put its people to the sword without mercy
 after that the children of judah went down to make war on the canaanites living in the hill country and in the south and in the lowlands
 and caleb went against the canaanites of hebron  now in earlier times hebron was named kiriath arba  and he put sheshai and ahiman and talmai to the sword
 and from there he went up against the people of debir  now the name of debir in earlier times was kiriath sepher 
 and caleb said i will give achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes kiriath sepher and takes it
 and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it so he gave him his daughter achsah for his wife
 now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and caleb said to her what is it
 and she said to him give me a blessing because you have put me in a dry south land now give me springs of water so caleb gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
 now hobab the kenite moses father in law had come up out of the town of palm trees with the children of judah into the waste land of arad and he went and was living among the amalekites
 and judah went with simeon his brother and overcame the canaanites living in zephath and put it under the curse and he gave the town the name of hormah
 then judah took gaza and its limit and ashkelon and its limit and ekron and its limit
 and the lord was with judah and he took the hill country for his heritage but he was unable to make the people of the valley go out for they had war carriages of iron
 and they gave hebron to caleb as moses had said and he took the land of the three sons of anak driving them out from there
 and the children of judah did not make the jebusites who were living in jerusalem go out the jebusites are still living with the children of benjamin in jerusalem
 and the family of joseph went up against beth el and the lord was with them
 so they sent men to make a search round beth el  now the name of the town in earlier times was luz 
 and the watchers saw a man coming out of the town and said to him if you will make clear to us the way into the town we will be kind to you
 so he made clear to them the way into the town and they put it to the sword but they let the man and all his family get away safe
 and he went into the land of the hittites building a town there and naming it luz which is its name to this day
 and manasseh did not take away the land of the people of beth shean and its daughter towns or of taanach and its daughter towns or of the people of dor and its daughter towns or of the people of ibleam and its daughter towns or of the people of megiddo and its daughter towns driving them out but the canaanites would go on living in that land
 and whenever israel became strong they put the canaanites to forced work without driving them out completely
