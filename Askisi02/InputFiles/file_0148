 and as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the day of the son of man
 they were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day of the overflowing of the waters when noah went into the ark and they all came to destruction
 in the same way in the days of lot they were feasting and trading they were planting and building
 but on the day when lot went out of sodom fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all
 so will it be in the day of the revelation of the son of man
 on that day if anyone is on the roof of the house and his goods are in the house let him not go down to take them away and let him who is in the field not go back to his house
 keep in mind lots wife
 if anyone makes an attempt to keep his life it will be taken from him but if anyone gives up his life he will keep it
 i say to you in that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed and one will be taken away and the other let go
 two women will be crushing grain together one will be taken away and the other let go
   
 and they answering him said where lord and he said to them where the body is there will the eagles come together
 and he made a story for them the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired
 saying there was a judge in a certain town who had no fear of god or respect for man
 and there was a widow in that town and she kept on coming to him and saying give me my right against the man who has done me wrong
 and for a time he would not but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god or respect for man
 because this widow is a trouble to me i will give her her right for if not i will be completely tired out by her frequent coming
 and the lord said give ear to the words of the evil judge
 and will not god do right in the cause of his saints whose cries come day and night to his ears though he is long in doing it
 i say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause but when the son of man comes will there be any faith on earth
 and he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good and had a low opinion of others
 two men went up to the temple for prayer one a pharisee and the other a tax farmer
 the pharisee taking up his position said to himself these words god i give you praise because i am not like other men who take more than their right who are evil doers who are untrue to their wives or even like this tax farmer
 twice in the week i go without food i give a tenth of all i have
 the tax farmer on the other hand keeping far away and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven made signs of grief and said god have mercy on me a sinner
 i say to you this man went back to his house with gods approval and not the other for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
 and they took their children to him so that he might put his hands on them but when the disciples saw it they said sharp words to them
 but jesus sent for them saying let the children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
 truly i say to you whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of god like a little child will not come into it at all
 and a certain ruler put a question to him saying good master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
