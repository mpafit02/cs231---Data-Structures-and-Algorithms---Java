 and the people will be crushed every one by his neighbour the young will be full of pride against the old and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble
 when one man puts his hand on another in his fathers house and says you have clothing be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition

 for jerusalem has become feeble and destruction has come on judah because their words and their acts are against the lord moving the eyes of his glory to wrath

 the ear rings and the chains and the delicate clothing
 the head bands and the arm chains and the worked bands and the perfume boxes and the jewels with secret powers
 the rings and the nose jewels
 the feast day dresses and the robes and the wide skirts and the handbags
 the looking glasses and the fair linen and the high head dresses and the veils
