 and what will you do in the day of punishment and in the destruction which is coming from far to whom will you go for help and what will become of your glory
  for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 ho  assyrian the rod of my wrath the instrument of my punishment 
 i will send him against a nation of wrongdoers and against the people of my wrath i will give him orders to take their wealth in war crushing them down like the dust in the streets
 but this is not what is in his mind and this is not his design but his purpose is destruction and the cutting off of more and more nations
 for he says are not all my captains kings
 will not the fate of calno be like that of carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus
 as my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images whose pictured images were more in number than those of jerusalem and samaria
 so as i have done to samaria and her images i will do to jerusalem and her images
 for this cause it will be that when the purpose of the lord against mount zion and jerusalem is complete i will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of assyria and on the glory of his uplifted eyes
 for he has said by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my knowledge for i am wise and i have taken away the limits of the peoples lands and the stores of their wealth have become mine and i have made towns low in the dust sending destruction on those living in them
 and i have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples as on the place where a bird has put her eggs and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone so i have taken all the earth for myself and not a wing was moved and not a mouth gave out a sound
 will the axe say high sounding words against him who is using it or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it as if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it or as if a stick might take up him who is not wood
 for this cause the lord the lord of armies will make his fat become wasted and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame
 and the light of israel will be for a fire and his holy one for a flame wasting and burning up his thorns in one day
 and he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields soul and body together and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease
 and the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number so that a child may put them down in writing
 and it will be in that day that the rest of israel and those of jacob who have come safely through these troubles will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back but their faith will be in the lord the holy one of israel
 the rest even the rest of jacob will come back to the strong god
 for though your people o israel are as the sand of the sea only a small number will come back for the destruction is fixed overflowing in righteousness
 for the lord the lord of armies is about to make destruction complete in all the land
 for this cause the lord the lord of armies says o my people living in zion have no fear of the assyrian even if his rod comes on your back and his stick is lifted up as in egypt
 for in a very short time my passion will be over and my wrath will be turned to their destruction
 and the lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him as when he overcame midian at the rock of oreb and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the egyptians
 and in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away and his yoke broken from off your neck
 he has gone up from pene rimmon he has come to aiath he has gone past migron at michmash he puts his forces in order
 they have gone across the mountain geba will be our resting place tonight they say ramah is shaking with fear gibeah of saul has gone in flight
 give a loud cry daughter of gallim let laishah give ear let anathoth give answer to her
 madmenah has gone the men of gebim are putting their goods in a safe place
 this very day he is stopping at nob he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem
