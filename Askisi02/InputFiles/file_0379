 so jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of ahab in jezreel and all his relations and his near friends and his priests till there were no more of them
 then he got up and came to samaria and he was at the meeting place of the keepers of sheep by the way
 when he came across the brothers of ahaziah king of judah and said who are you and they said we are the brothers of ahaziah king of judah we are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen
 and he said take them living so they took them living and put them to death in the water hole of beth eked of the forty two men he put every one to death
 and when he had gone away from there he came across jehonadab the son of rechab and he said good day to him and said to him is your heart true to mine as mine is to yours and jehonadab in answer said it is and jehu said if it is give me your hand and he gave him his hand and he made him come up into his carriage
 and he said come with me and see how i am on fire for the lords cause so he made him go with him in his carriage
 and when he came to samaria he put to death all those of ahabs family who were still in samaria till there were no more of them as the lord had said to elijah
 then jehu got all the people together and said to them ahab was baals servant in a small way but jehu will be his servant on a great scale
 now send for all the prophets of baal and all his servants and all his priests to come to me let no one keep away for i have a great offering to make to baal anyone who is not present will be put to death this jehu did with deceit his purpose being the destruction of the servants of baal
 and jehu said let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of baal so a public statement was made
 and jehu sent out through all israel and all the servants of baal came not one kept away and they came into the house of baal so that it was full from end to end
 and jehu said to him who kept the robes get out robes for all the servants of baal so he got out robes for them
 and jehu with jehonadab the son of rechab went into the house of baal and he said to the servants of baal make a search with care to see that no servant of the lord is with you but only servants of baal
 then they went in to make offerings and burned offerings now jehu had put eighty men outside and said to them if any man whom i give into your hands gets away the life of him who lets him go will be the price of his life
 then when the burned offering was ended straight away jehu said to the armed men and the captains go in and put them to death let not one come out so they put them to the sword and pulling the images to the earth they went into the holy place of the house of baal
 and they took out the image of asherah from the house of baal and had it burned
 the altar of baal was pulled down and the house of baal was broken up and made an unclean place as it is to this day
 so jehu put an end to the worship of baal in israel
 but jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat and the evil he made israel do the gold oxen were still in beth el and in dan
 and the lord said to jehu because you have done well in doing what is right in my eyes and effecting all my purpose for the family of ahab your sons will be kings of israel to the fourth generation
 but jehu did not take care to keep the law of the lord with all his heart he did not keep himself from the sin which jeroboam did and made israel do
 in those days the lord was angry first with israel and hazael made attacks on all the land of israel
 east of jordan in all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer by the valley of the arnon all gilead and bashan
 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehu went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and jehoahaz his son became king in his place
 and the time of jehus rule over israel in samaria was twenty eight years
 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom put to death
 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah secretly took joash the son of ahaziah with the woman who took care of him away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him in the bedroom and they kept him safe from athaliah so that he was not put to death
 and for six years she kept him safe in the house of the lord while athaliah was ruling over the land
 then in the seventh year jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds of the carians and the armed men and taking them into the house of the lord made an agreement with them and made them take an oath in the house of the lord and let them see the kings son
