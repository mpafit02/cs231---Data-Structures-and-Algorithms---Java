 if now there may be an angel sent to him one of the thousands which there are to be between him and god and to make clear to man what is right for him
 and if he has mercy on him and says let him not go down to the underworld i have given the price for his life
 then his flesh becomes young again and he comes back to the days of his early strength
 he makes his prayer to god and he has mercy on him he sees gods face with cries of joy he gives news of his righteousness to men
 he makes a song saying i did wrong turning from the straight way but he did not give me the reward of my sin
 he kept my soul from the underworld and my life sees the light in full measure
 truly god does all these things to man twice and three times
 keeping back his soul from the underworld so that he may see the light of life
 take note o job give ear to me keep quiet while i say what is in my mind
 if you have anything to say give me an answer for it is my desire that you may be judged free from sin
 if not give attention to me and keep quiet and i will give you wisdom
 and elihu made answer and said
 give ear you wise to my words and you who have knowledge give attention to me
 for words are tested by the ear as food is tasted by the mouth
 let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good
 for job has said i am upright and it is god who has taken away my right
 though i am right still i am in pain my wound may not be made well though i have done no wrong
 what man is like job a man who freely makes sport of god
 and goes in the company of evil doers walking in the way of sinners
 for he has said it is no profit to a man to take delight in god
 now then you wise take note you men of knowledge give ear to me let it be far from god to do evil and from the ruler of all to do wrong
 for he gives to every man the reward of his work and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways
 truly god does not do evil and the ruler of all is not a false judge
 who put the earth into his care or made him responsible for the world
 if he made his spirit come back to him taking his breath into himself again
 all flesh would come to an end together and man would go back to the dust
 if you are wise take note of this give ear to the voice of my words
 how may a hater of right be a ruler and will you say that the upright ruler of all is evil
 he who says to a king you are an evil doer and to rulers you are sinners
 who has no respect for rulers and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor for they are all the work of his hands
