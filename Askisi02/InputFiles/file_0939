 happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners or take his place in the way of evil doers or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the lord
 but whose delight is in the law of the lord and whose mind is on his law day and night
 he will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water which gives its fruit at the right time whose leaves will ever be green and he will do well in all his undertakings
 the evil doers are not so but are like the dust from the grain which the wind takes away
 for this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged and the evil doers will have no place among the upright
 because the lord sees the way of the upright but the end of the sinner is destruction
 why do you keep far away o lord why are you not to be seen in times of trouble
 the evil doer in his pride is cruel to the poor let him be taken by the tricks of his invention
 for the evil doer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the lord saying evil against him
 the evil doer in his pride says god will not make a search all his thoughts are there is no god
 his ways are ever fixed your decisions are higher than he may see as for his haters they are as nothing to him
 he has said in his heart i will not be moved through all generations i will never be in trouble
 his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts
 he is waiting in the dark places of the towns in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong his eyes are secretly turned against the poor
 he keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole waiting to put his hands on the poor man and pulling him into his net
 the upright are crushed and made low and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones
 he says in his heart god has no memory of me his face is turned away he will never see it
 up  o lord let your hand be lifted give thought to the poor
 why has the evil doer a low opinion of god saying in his heart you will not make search for it
 you have seen it for your eyes are on sorrow and grief to take it into your hand the poor man puts his faith in you you have been the helper of the child who has no father
 let the arm of the sinner and the evil doer be broken go on searching for his sin till there is no more
 the lord is king for ever and ever the nations are gone from his land
 lord you have given ear to the prayer of the poor you will make strong their hearts you will give them a hearing
 to give decision for the child without a father and for the broken hearted so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared
 &lta psalm of praise&gt make a glad sound to the lord all the earth
 give worship to the lord with joy come before him with a song
 be certain that the lord is god it is he who has made us and we are his we are his people and the sheep to whom he gives food
 come into his doors with joy and into his house with praise give him honour blessing his name
 for the lord is good and his mercy is never ending his faith is unchanging through all generations
 &lta psalm of david&gt i will make a song of mercy and righteousness to you o lord will i make melody
