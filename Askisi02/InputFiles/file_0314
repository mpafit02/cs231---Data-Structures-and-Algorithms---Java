 and say it is the kings order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till i come again in peace
 and micaiah said if you come back at all in peace the lord has not sent his word by me
 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will make a change in my clothing so that i do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes so the king of israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight
 now the king of aram had given orders to the thirty two captains of his war carriages saying make no attack on small or great but only on the king of israel
 so when the captains of the war carriages saw jehoshaphat they said truly this is the king of israel and turning against him they came round him but jehoshaphat gave a cry
 and when the captains of the war carriages saw that he was not the king of israel they went back from going after him
 and a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his war carriage go to one side and take me away out of the army for i am badly wounded
 but the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king was supported in his war carriage facing the aramaeans and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound and by evening he was dead
 and about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army saying let every man go back to his town and his country for the king is dead
 and they came to samaria and put the kings body to rest in samaria
 and the war carriage was washed by the pool of samaria which was the bathing place of the loose women and the dogs were drinking his blood there as the lord had said
 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all he did and his ivory house and all the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 so ahab was put to rest with his fathers and ahaziah his son became king in his place
 and jehoshaphat the son of asa became king over judah in the fourth year of ahabs rule over israel
 jehoshaphat was thirty five years old when he became king and he was king for twenty five years in jerusalem his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
 he did as asa his father had done not turning away from it but doing what was right in the eyes of the lord but the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel
 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his great power and how he went to war are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 he put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods all those who were still in the land in the time of his father asa
 at that time there was no king in edom
 and the representative of king jehoshaphat made a tarshish ship to go to ophir for gold but it did not go because it was broken at ezion geber
 then ahaziah the son of ahab said to jehoshaphat let my men go with yours in the ships but jehoshaphat would not let them
 then jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david his father and jehoram his son became king in his place
 ahaziah the son of ahab became king over israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of jehoshaphat the king of judah and he was king over israel for two years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord going in the ways of his father and his mother and in the ways of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel do evil
 he was a servant and worshipper of baal moving the lord the god of israel to wrath as his father had done
 solomon became the son in law of pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter as his wife keeping her in the town of david till the house he was building for himself and the house of the lord and the wall round jerusalem were complete
 but all this time the people were making their offerings in the high places because no house had been put up to the name of the lord till those days
 and solomon in his love for the lord kept the laws of david his father but he made offerings and let them go up in smoke on the high places
