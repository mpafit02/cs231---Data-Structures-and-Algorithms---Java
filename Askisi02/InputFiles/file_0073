 and he said my brothers and fathers give hearing the god of glory came to our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he was living in haran
 and said to him go out of your land and away from your family and come into the land to which i will be your guide
 then he came out of the land of the chaldaeans and went into haran and from there when his father was dead he was guided by god into this land where you are living now
 and god gave him no heritage in it not even enough to put his foot on but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him though he had no child at that time
 and god said that his seed would be living in a strange land and that they would make them servants and be cruel to them for four hundred years
 and i will be the judge said god of that nation which made them servants and after that they will come out and give me worship in this place
 and he made with him the agreement of which circumcision was the sign and so abraham had a son isaac and gave him circumcision on the eighth day and isaac had a son jacob and jacob was the father of the twelve heads of the families of israel
 and the brothers moved with envy against joseph gave him to the egyptians for money but god was with him
 and made him free from all his troubles and gave him wisdom and the approval of pharaoh king of egypt who made him ruler over egypt and all his house
