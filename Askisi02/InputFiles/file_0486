 and in shushan the jews put to death five hundred men
 they put to death parshandatha dalphon aspatha
 poratha adalia aridatha
 parmashta arisai aridai and vaizatha
 the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the hater of the jews but they put not a hand on any of their goods
 on that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of shushan was given to the king
 and the king said to esther the queen the jews have put five hundred men to death in shushan as well as the ten sons of haman what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom  now what is your prayer for it will be given to you what other request have you and it will be done
 then esther said if it is the kings pleasure let authority be given to the jews in shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today and let orders be given for the hanging of hamans ten sons
 and the king said that this was to be done and the order was given out in shushan and the hanging of hamans ten sons was effected
 for the jews who were in shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month adar and put to death three hundred men in shushan but they put not a hand on their goods
 and the other jews in every division of the kingdom came together fighting for their lives and got salvation from their haters and put seventy five thousand of them to death but they did not put a hand on their goods
 this they did on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
 but the jews in shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month and on the fifteenth day they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
 so the jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day a day for sending offerings one to another
 and mordecai sent letters to all the jews in every division of the kingdom of ahasuerus near and far
 ordering them to keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same month every year
 as days on which the jews had rest from their haters and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy and from weeping to a good day and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor
 and the jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as mordecai had given them orders in writing
 because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the hater of all the jews had made designs for their destruction attempting to get a decision by pur  that is chance  with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off
 but when the business was put before the king he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the jews was to be turned against himself and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging
 so these days were named purim after the name of pur and so because of the words of this letter and of what they had seen in connection with this business and what had come to them
 the jews made a rule and gave an undertaking causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same so that it might be in force for ever that they would keep those two days as ordered in the letter at the fixed time every year
 and that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family in every division of the kingdom and every town that there might never be a time when these days of purim would not be kept among the jews or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their seed
 then esther the queen daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the purim
 and he sent letters to all the jews in the hundred and twenty seven divisions of the kingdom of ahasuerus with true words of peace
 giving the force of law to these days of purim at their fixed times as they had been ordered by mordecai the jew and esther the queen and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help
 the order given by esther gave the force of law to the rules about the purim and it was recorded in the book
 now these are the names of the sons of israel who came into egypt every man and his family came with jacob
 reuben simeon levi and judah
 issachar zebulun and benjamin
