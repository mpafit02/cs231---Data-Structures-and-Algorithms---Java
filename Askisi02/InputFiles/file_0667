 for this is the word of the lord who made the heavens he is god the maker and designer of the earth who made it not to be a waste but as a living place for man i am the lord and there is no other
 i have not given my word in secret in a place in the underworld i did not say to the seed of jacob go into a waste land to make request of me i the lord say what is true my word is righteousness
 come together even come near you nations who are still living they have no knowledge who take up their image of wood and make prayer to a god in whom is no salvation
 give the word put forward your cause let us have a discussion together who has given news of this in the past who made it clear in early times did not i the lord and there is no god but me a true god and a saviour there is no other
 let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have salvation all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is no other
 by myself have i taken an oath a true word has gone from my mouth and will not be changed that to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give honour
 only in the lord will jacob overcome and be strong together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction
 in the lord will all the seed of israel get their rights and they will give glory to him
 bel is bent down nebo is falling their images are on the beasts and on the cattle the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast
 they are bent down they are falling together they were not able to keep their images safe but they themselves have been taken prisoner
 give ear to me o family of jacob and all the rest of the people of israel who have been supported by me from their birth and have been my care from their earliest days
 even when you are old i will be the same and when you are grey haired i will take care of you i will still be responsible for what i made yes i will take you and keep you safe
 who in your eyes is my equal or what comparison will you make with me
 as for those who take gold out of a bag and put silver in the scales they give payment to a gold worker to make it into a god they go down on their faces and give it worship
 they put him on their backs and take him up and put him in his fixed place from which he may not be moved if a man gives a cry for help to him he is unable to give an answer or get him out of his trouble
 keep this in mind and be shamed let it come back to your memory you sinners
 let the things which are past come to your memory for i am god and there is no other i am god and there is no one like me
 making clear from the first what is to come and from past times the things which have not so far come about saying my purpose is fixed and i will do all my pleasure
 sending for a bird of strong flight from the east the man of my purpose from a far country i have said it and i will give effect to it the thing designed by me will certainly be done
 give ear to me you feeble hearted who have no faith in my righteousness
 my righteousness is near it is not far off salvation will come quickly and i will make zion free and give israel my glory
 come and take your seat in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon come down from your seat of power and take your place on the earth o daughter of the chaldaeans for you will never again seem soft and delicate
 take the crushing stones and get the meal crushed take off your veil put away your robe let your legs be uncovered go through the rivers
 the shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all i will give punishment without mercy
 says the lord who takes up our cause the lord of armies is his name the holy one of israel
 be seated in the dark without a word o daughter of the chaldaeans for you will no longer be named the queen of kingdoms
 i was angry with my people i put shame on my heritage and gave them into your hands you had no mercy on them you put a cruel yoke on those who were old
 and you said i will be a queen for ever you did not give attention to these things and did not keep in mind what would come after
 so now take note of this you who are given up to pleasure living without fear of evil saying in your heart i am and there is no one like me i will never be a widow or have my children taken from me
 but these two things will come on you suddenly in one day the loss of children and of husband in full measure they will come on you for all your secret arts and all your wonders
