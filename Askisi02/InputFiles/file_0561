  and he took me  to the south and in front of the separate place and in front of the building there were rooms
 and there was a walk in front of them like that by the rooms on the north they were equally long and wide and the ways out of them were the same in design and had the same sort of doors
 and under the rooms on the south was a door at the head of the outer wall in the direction of the east as one goes in
 and he said to me the north rooms and the south rooms in front of the separate place are the holy rooms where the priests who come near the lord take the most holy things for their food there the most holy things are placed with the meal offering and the sin offering and the offering for error for the place is holy
 when the priests go in they may not go out of the holy place into the outer square and there they are to put the robes in which they do the work of the lords house for they are holy and they have to put on other clothing before they come near that which has to do with the people
 and when he had come to the end of measuring the inner house he took me out to the doorway looking to the east and took its measure all round
 he went round and took the measure of it on the east side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
 and he went round and took the measure of it on the north side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
 and he went round and took the measure of it on the south side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
 and he went round and took the measure of it on the west side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
 he took its measure on the four sides and it had a wall all round five hundred long and five hundred wide separating what was holy from what was common
 and he took me to the doorway looking to the east
 and there was the glory of the god of israel coming from the way of the east and his voice was like the sound of great waters and the earth was shining with his glory
 and the vision which i saw was like the vision i had seen when he came for the destruction of the town and like the vision which i saw by the river chebar and i went down on my face
 and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the doorway looking to the east
 and the spirit lifting me up took me into the inner square and i saw that the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and the voice of one talking to me came to my ears from inside the house and the man was by my side
 and he said to me son of man this is the place where the seat of my power is and the resting place of my feet where i will be among the children of israel for ever and no longer will the people of israel make my holy name unclean they or their kings by their loose ways and by the dead bodies of their kings
 by putting their doorstep by my doorstep and the pillar of their door by the pillar of my door with only a wall between me and them and they have made my holy name unclean by the disgusting things which they have done so in my wrath i sent destruction on them
 now let them put their loose ways and the dead bodies of their kings far from me and i will be among them for ever
 you son of man give the children of israel an account of this house so that they may be shamed because of their evil doing and let them see the vision of it and its image
 and they will be shamed by what they have done so give them the knowledge of the form of the house and its structure and the ways out of it and into it and all its laws and its rules writing it down for them so that they may keep all its laws and do them
 this is the law of the house on the top of the mountain all the space round it on every side will be most holy see this is the law of the house
