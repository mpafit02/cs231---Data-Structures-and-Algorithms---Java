 their eyes are bursting with fat they have more than their hearts desire
 their thoughts are deep with evil designs their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts
 their mouth goes up to heaven their tongues go walking through the earth
 for this reason they are full of bread and water is ever flowing for them
 and they say how will the lord see this is there knowledge in the most high
 truly such are the sinners they do well at all times and their wealth is increased
 as for me i have made my heart clean to no purpose washing my hands in righteousness
 for i have been troubled all the day every morning have i undergone punishment
 if i would make clear what it is like i would say you are false to the generation of your children
 when my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this it was a weariness in my eyes
 till i went into gods holy place and saw the end of the evil doers
 you put their feet where there was danger of slipping so that they go down into destruction
 how suddenly are they wasted  fears are the cause of their destruction
 as a dream when one is awake they are ended they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over
 my heart was made bitter and i was pained by the bite of grief
 as for me i was foolish and without knowledge i was like a beast before you
 but still i am ever with you you have taken me by my right hand
 your wisdom will be my guide and later you will put me in a place of honour
 whom have i in heaven but you and having you i have no desire for anything on earth
 my flesh and my heart are wasting away but god is the rock of my heart and my eternal heritage
 for those who are far away from you will come to destruction you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you
 but it is good for me to come near to god i have put my faith in the lord god so that i may make clear all his works
 &ltmaschil of asaph&gt of god why have you put us away from you for ever why is the fire of your wrath smoking against the sheep who are your care
 keep in mind your band of worshippers for whom you gave payment in the days which are past whom you took for yourself as the people of your heritage even this mountain of zion which has been your resting place
 go up and see the unending destruction all the evil which your haters have done in the holy place
 sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers they have put up their signs to be seen
 they are cutting down like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees
 your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades
 they have put on fire your holy place they have made the place of your name unclean pulling it down to the earth
 they have said in their hearts let us put an end to them all together they have given over to the fire all gods places of worship in the land
