 and those of the sons of merari who were numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who did the work in the tent of meeting
 who were numbered by families were three thousand two hundred
 this is the number of the sons of merari numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord
 and all the levites who were numbered by moses and aaron and the chiefs of the people by families in the order of their fathers houses
 those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work of the tent of meeting and of its transport
 came to eight thousand five hundred and eighty
 at the order of the lord they were numbered by moses every one in relation to his work and to his part in the transport so they were numbered by moses at the order of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel to put outside the tent circle every leper and anyone who has any sort of flow from his body and anyone who is unclean from the touch of the dead
 male or female they are to be put outside the tent circle so that they may not make unclean my resting place among them
 so the children of israel did as the lord had said to moses and put them outside the tent circle
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a man or a woman does any of the sins of men going against the word of the lord and is in the wrong
 let them say openly what they have done and make payment for the wrong done with the addition of a fifth part and give it to him to whom the wrong was done
 but if the man has no relation to whom the payment may be made then the payment for sin made to the lord will be the priests in addition to the sheep offered to take away his sin
 and every offering lifted up of all the holy things which the children of israel give to the priest will be his
 and every mans holy things will be his whatever a man gives to the priest will be his
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if any mans wife does wrong sinning against him
 by taking as her lover another man and keeps it secret so that her husband has no knowledge of it and there is no witness against her and she is not taken in the act
 if the spirit of doubt comes into her husbands heart and he has doubts of his wife with good cause or if he has doubts of her without cause
 then let him take her to the priest offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal without oil or perfume for it is a meal offering of a bitter spirit a meal offering keeping wrongdoing in mind
 and the priest will make her come near and put her before the lord
 and the priest will take holy water in a pot and put in it dust from the floor of the house
 and he will make the woman come before the lord with her hair loose and will put the meal offering the offering of a bitter spirit in her hands and the priest will take in his hand the bitter water causing the curse
 and he will make her take an oath and say to her if no man has been your lover and you have not been with another in place of your husband you are free from this bitter water causing the curse
 but if you have been with another in place of your husband and have made yourself unclean with a lover
 then the priest will put the oath of the curse on the woman and say to her may the lord make you a curse and an oath among your people sending on you wasting of the legs and disease of the stomach
 and this water of the curse will go into your body causing disease of your stomach and wasting of your legs and the woman will say so be it
