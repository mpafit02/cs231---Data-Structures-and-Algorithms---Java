 god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah the heavens were covered with his glory and the earth was full of his praise
 he was shining like the light he had rays coming out from his hand there his power was kept secret
 before him went disease and flames went out at his feet
 from his high place he sent shaking on the earth he saw and nations were suddenly moved and the eternal mountains were broken the unchanging hills were bent down his ways are eternal
 the curtains of cushan were troubled and the tents of midian were shaking
 was your wrath burning against the rivers were you angry with the sea that you went on your horses on your war carriages of salvation
 your bow was quite uncovered selah by you the earth was cut through with rivers
 the mountains saw you and were moved with fear the clouds were streaming with water the voice of the deep was sounding the sun did not come up and the moon kept still in her place
 at the light of your arrows they went away at the shining of your polished spear
 you went stepping through the land in wrath crushing the nations in your passion
 you went out for the salvation of your people for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put wounding the head of the family of the evil doer uncovering the base even to the neck selah
 you have put your spears through his head his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems they had joy in driving away the poor in making a meal of them secretly
 the feet of your horses were on the sea on the mass of great waters
 hearing it my inner parts were moved and my lips were shaking at the sound my bones became feeble and my steps were uncertain under me i gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble when his forces came up against the people in bands
