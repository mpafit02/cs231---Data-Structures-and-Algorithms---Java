 and come and take your place before me in this house which is named by my name and say we have been made safe so that you may do all these disgusting things
 has this house which is named by my name become a hole of thieves to you truly i even i have seen it says the lord
 but go now to my place which was in shiloh where i put my name at first and see what i did to it because of the evil doing of my people israel
 and now because you have done all these works says the lord and i sent my word to you getting up early and sending but you did not give ear and my voice came to you but you gave no answer
 for this reason i will do to the house which is named by my name and in which you have put your faith and to the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh
 and i will send you away from before my face as i have sent away all your brothers even all the seed of ephraim
 and as for you  jeremiah  make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them make no request for them to me for i will not give ear
 do you not see what they are doing in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
 the children go for wood the fathers get the fire burning the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven and drink offerings are drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
 are they moving me to wrath says the lord are they not moving themselves to their shame
 so this is what the lord god has said see my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place on man and beast and on the trees of the field and on the produce of the earth it will be burning and will not be put out
 these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts and take flesh for your food
 for i said nothing to your fathers and gave them no orders on the day when i took them out of egypt about burned offerings or offerings of beasts
 but this was the order i gave them saying give ear to my voice and i will be your god and you will be my people go in all the way ordered by me so that all may be well for you
 but they took no note and did not give ear but were guided by the thoughts and the pride of their evil hearts going back and not forward
 from the day when your fathers came out of egypt till this day i have sent my servants the prophets to you getting up early every day and sending them
 but still they took no note and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff doing worse than their fathers
 and you are to say all these words to them but they will not give ear to you you will send out your voice to them but they will give no answer
 and you are to say to them this is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their god or taken his teaching to heart good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths
 let your hair be cut off o jerusalem and let it go and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops for the lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up
 for the children of judah have done what is evil in my eyes says the lord they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name making it unclean
 and they have put up the high place of topheth in the valley of the son of hinnom burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind
 for this cause the days are coming says the lord when it will no longer be named topheth or the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of death for they will put the dead into the earth in topheth till there is no more room
 and the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth and there will be no one to send them away
 and in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem i will put an end to the laughing voices the voice of joy and the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride for the land will become a waste
 at that time says the lord they will take the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his rulers and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the people of jerusalem out of their resting places
 and they will put them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven whose lovers and servants they have been after whom they have gone to whom they have made prayers and to whom they have given worship they will not be put together or placed in the earth they will be waste on the face of the earth
 and death will be desired more than life by the rest of this evil family who are still living in all the places where i have sent them away says the lord of armies
 further you are to say to them this is what the lord has said will those who are falling not be lifted up again will he who has gone away not come back
 why do these people of jerusalem go back for ever turning away they will not give up their deceit they will not come back
