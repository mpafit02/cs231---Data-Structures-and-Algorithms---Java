 but when they saw that he was a jew all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours great is diana of ephesus
 and when the chief secretary had got the people quiet he said men of ephesus is any man without knowledge that the town of ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great diana who was sent down from jupiter
 so then because these things may not be doubted it would be better for you to be quiet and do nothing unwise
 for you have taken these men who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess
 if then demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man the law is open to them and there are judges let them put up a cause at law against one another
 but if any other business is in question let it be taken up in the regular meeting
 for truly we are in danger of being made responsible for this days trouble there being no cause for it and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together
 and when he had said this he sent the meeting away
 and when the day of pentecost was come they were all together in one place
 and suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind and all the house where they were was full of it
 and they saw tongues like flames of fire coming to rest on every one of them
 and they were all full of the holy spirit and were talking in different languages as the spirit gave them power
 now there were living at jerusalem jews god fearing men from every nation under heaven
 and when this sound came to their ears they all came together and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language
 and they were full of wonder and said are not all these men galilaeans
 and how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth
 men of parthia media and elam and those living in mesopotamia in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
 in phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene and those who have come from rome jews by birth and others who have become jews
 men of crete and arabia to all of us they are talking in our different languages of the great works of god
 and they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another what is the reason of this
 but others making sport of them said they are full of new wine
 but peter getting up with the eleven said in a loud voice o men of judaea and all you who are living in jerusalem take note of this and give ear to my words
 for these men are not overcome with wine as it seems to you for it is only the third hour of the day
 but this is the thing which was said by the prophet joel
 and it will come about in the last days says god that i will send out my spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets and your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams
 and on my men servants and my women servants i will send my spirit and they will be prophets
 and wonders will be seen in heaven and signs on the earth blood and fire and smoke
 the sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood before that great day of the lord comes in glory
 and whoever makes his prayer to the lord will have salvation
 men of israel give ear to these words jesus of nazareth a man who had the approval of god as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which god did by him among you as you yourselves have knowledge
