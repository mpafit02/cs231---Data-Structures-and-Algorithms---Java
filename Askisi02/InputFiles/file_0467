 of gad he said a blessing be on him who makes wide the limits of gad he takes his rest like a she lion taking for himself the arm and the crown of the head

 no other is like the god of jeshurun coming on the heavens to your help and letting his glory be seen in the skies
 the god of your fathers is your safe resting place and under you are his eternal arms driving out the forces of your haters from before you he said let destruction overtake them
 and israel is living in peace the fountain of jacob by himself in a land of grain and wine with dew dropping from the heavens
 happy are you o israel who is like you a people whose saviour is the lord whose help is your cover whose sword is your strength  all those who are against you will put themselves under your rule and your feet will be planted on their high places
 and moses went up from the table lands of moab to mount nebo to the top of pisgah which is facing jericho and the lord let him see all the land the land of gilead as far as dan
 and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah as far as the great sea of the west
 and the south and the circle of the valley of jericho the town of palm trees as far as zoar
 and the lord said to him this is the land about which i made an oath to abraham isaac and jacob saying i will give it to your seed now i have let you see it with your eyes but you will not go in there
 so death came to moses the servant of the lord there in the land of moab as the lord had said
 and the lord put him to rest in the valley in the land of moab opposite beth peor but no man has knowledge of his resting place to this day
 and moses at his death was a hundred and twenty years old his eye had not become clouded or his natural force become feeble
 for thirty days the children of israel were weeping for moses in the table lands of moab till the days of weeping and sorrow for moses were ended
 and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had put his hands on him and the children of israel gave ear to him and did as the lord had given orders to moses
 there has never been another prophet in israel like moses whom the lord had knowledge of face to face
 in all the signs and wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
 and in all the acts of power and fear which moses did before the eyes of all israel
 and now give ear o israel to the laws and the decisions which i am teaching you and do them so that life may be yours and you may go in and take for yourselves the land which the lord the god of your fathers is giving you
 make no addition to the orders which i give you and take nothing from them but keep the orders of the lord your god which i give you
 your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baal peor for destruction came from the lord on all those among you who went after baal peor
 but you who kept faith with the lord are living every one of you today
