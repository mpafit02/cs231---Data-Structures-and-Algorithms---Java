 when zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah first became king this word came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 this is what the lord has said to me make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck
 and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the children of ammon and to the king of tyre and to the king of zidon by their servants who come to jerusalem to zedekiah king of judah
 and give them orders to say to their masters this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said say to your masters
 i have made the earth and man and beast on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and i will give it to anyone at my pleasure
 and now i have given all these lands into the hands of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and i have given the beasts of the field to him for his use
 and all the nations will be servants to him and to his son and to his sons son till the time comes for his land to be overcome and then a number of nations and great kings will take it for their use
 and it will come about that if any nation does not become a servant to this same nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon then i will send punishment on that nation says the lord by the sword and need of food and by disease till i have given them into his hands
 and you are not to give attention to your prophets or your readers of signs or your dreamers or those who see into the future or those who make use of secret arts who say to you you will not become servants of the king of babylon
 for they say false words to you so that you may be sent away far from your land and so that you may be forced out by me and come to destruction
 but as for that nation which puts its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and becomes his servant i will let that nation keep on in its land farming it and living in it says the lord
 and i said all this to zedekiah king of judah saying put your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and become his servants and his people so that you may keep your lives
 why are you desiring death you and your people by the sword and because food is gone and by disease as the lord has said of the nation which does not become the servant of the king of babylon
 and you are not to give ear to the prophets who say to you you will not become servants of the king of babylon for what they say is not true
 for i have not sent them says the lord but they are saying what is false in my name so that i might send you out by force causing destruction to come on you and on your prophets
 and i said to the priests and to all the people this is what the lord has said give no attention to the words of your prophets who say to you see in a very little time now the vessels of the lords house will come back again from babylon for what they say to you is false
 give no attention to them become servants of the king of babylon and keep yourselves from death why let this town become a waste
 but if they are prophets and if the word of the lord is with them let them now make request to the lord of armies that the vessels which are still in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem may not go to babylon
 for this is what the lord has said about the rest of the vessels which are still in this town
 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon did not take away when he took jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah a prisoner from jerusalem to babylon with all the great men of judah and jerusalem
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said about the rest of the vessels in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem
 they will be taken away to babylon and there they will be till the day when i send their punishment on them says the lord then i will take them up and put them back in their place
 and it came about in that year when zedekiah first became king of judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azzur the prophet who came from gibeon said to jeremiah in the house of the lord before the priests and all the people
 these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel by me the yoke of the king of babylon has been broken
 in the space of two years i will send back into this place all the vessels of the lords house which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place to babylon
 and i will let jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah come back to this place with all the prisoners of judah who went to babylon says the lord for i will have the yoke of the king of babylon broken
 then the prophet jeremiah said to the prophet hananiah before the priests and all the people who had come into the house of the lord
 the prophet jeremiah said so be it may the lord do so may the lord give effect to the words which you have said and let the vessels of the lords house and all the people who have been taken away come back from babylon to this place
 but still give ear to this word which i am saying to you and to all the people
 the prophets who were before me and before you from early times gave word to a number of countries and great kingdoms about war and destruction and disease
