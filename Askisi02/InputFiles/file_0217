 truly i say to you he will put him over all he has
 but if that evil servant says in his heart my lord is a long time in coming
 and is cruel to the other servants taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine
 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him and in an hour of which he has no knowledge
 and will have him cut in two and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins the friends of the bride who took their lights and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband
 and five of them were foolish and five were wise
 for the foolish when they took their lights took no oil with them
 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights
 now the husband was a long time in coming and they all went to sleep
 but in the middle of the night there is a cry the husband comes  go out to him
 then all those virgins got up and made ready their lights
 and the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lights are going out
 but the wise made answer saying there may not be enough for us and you it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves
 and while they went to get oil the master came and those who were ready went in with him to the feast and the door was shut
 after that the other virgins came saying lord lord let us in
 but he made answer and said truly i say to you i have no knowledge of you
 keep watch then because you are not certain of the day or of the hour
 for it is as when a man about to take a journey got his servants together and gave them his property
 and to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to everyone as he was able and he went on his journey
 straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them and made five more
 in the same way he who had been given the two got two more
 but he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth and kept his lords money in a secret place
 now after a long time the lord of those servants comes and makes up his account with them
 and he who had the five talents came with his other five talents saying lord you gave into my care five talents see i have got five more
 his lord said to him well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing i will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
 and he who had the two talents came and said lord you gave into my care two talents see i have got two more
 his lord said to him well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing i will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
 and he who had had the one talent came and said lord i had knowledge that you are a hard man getting in grain where you have not put seed and making profits for which you have done no work
 and i was in fear and went away and put your talent in the earth here is what is yours
