 and i will have no mercy on her children for they are the children of her loose ways
 for their mother has been untrue she who gave them birth has done things of shame for she said i will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water my wool and my linen my oil and my wine
 for this cause i will put thorns in her road building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way
 and if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them if she makes search for them she will not see them then will she say i will go back to my first husband for then it was better for me than now
 for she had no knowledge that it was i who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the baal
 so i will take away again my grain in its time and my wine and i will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered
 and now i will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers and no one will take her out of my hand
 and i will put an end to all her joy her feasts her new moons and her sabbaths and all her regular meetings
 and i will make waste her vines and her fig trees of which she has said these are the payments which my lovers have made to me and i will make them a waste of trees and the beasts of the field will take them for food
 and i will give her punishment for the days of the baals to whom she has been burning perfumes when she made herself fair with her nose rings and her jewels and went after her lovers giving no thought to me says the lord
 for this cause i will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her
 and i will give her vine gardens from there and the valley of achor for a door of hope and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young and as in the time when she came up out of the land of egypt
 and in that day says the lord you will say to me ishi and you will never again give me the name of baali
 for i will take away the names of the baals out of her mouth and never again will she say their names
 and in that day i will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth i will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land and will make them take their rest in peace
 and i will take you as my bride for ever truly i will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging in love and in mercies
 i will take you as my bride in good faith and you will have knowledge of the lord
 and it will be in that day says the lord that i will give an answer to the heavens and the heavens to the earth
 and the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil and they will give an answer to jezreel
 and i will put her as seed in the earth and i will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given and i will say to those who were not my people you are my people and they will say my god
 and the lord said to me give your love again to a woman who has a lover and is false to her husband even as the lord has love for the children of israel though they are turned to other gods and are lovers of grape cakes
 so i got her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley
 and i said to her you are to be mine for a long space of time you are not to be false to me and no other man is to have you for his wife and so will i be to you
 for the children of israel will for a long time be without king and without ruler without offerings and without pillars and without ephod or images
 and after that the children of israel will come back and go in search of the lord their god and david their king and they will come in fear to the lord and to his mercies in the days to come
 give ear to the word of the lord o children of israel for the lord has a cause against the people of this land because there is no good faith in it and no mercy and no knowledge of god in the land
 there is cursing and broken faith violent death and attacks on property men are untrue in married life houses are broken into and there is blood touching blood
 because of this the land will be dry and everyone living in it will be wasted away with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven even the fishes of the sea will be taken away
 let no man go to law or make protests for your people are like those who go to law with a priest
 you will not be able to keep on your feet by day and by night the prophet will be falling down with you and i will give your mother to destruction
