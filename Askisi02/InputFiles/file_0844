 and he put to death the burned offering and aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
 and they gave him the parts of the burned offering in their order and the head to be burned on the altar
 and the inside parts and the legs when they had been washed with water were burned on the burned offering on the altar
 and he made an offering for the people and took the goat of the sin offering for the people and put it to death offering it for sin in the same way as the first
 and he took the burned offering offering it in the ordered way
 and he put the meal offering before the lord and taking some of it in his hand he had it burned on the altar separately from the burned offering of the morning
 and he put to death the ox and the sheep which were the peace offerings for the people and aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
 and as for the fat of the ox and the fat tail of the sheep and the fat covering the inside parts and the kidneys and the fat on the liver
 they put the fat on the breasts and the fat was burned on the altar
 and aaron took the breasts and the right leg waving them for a wave offering before the lord as moses gave orders
 and aaron lifting up his hands to the people gave them a blessing and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burned offering and the peace offerings
 and moses and aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and gave the people a blessing and the glory of the lord was seen by all the people
 and fire came out from before the lord burning up the offering on the altar and the fat and when all the people saw it they gave a loud cry falling down on their faces
 the word of the lord to israel by malachi
 you have been loved by me says the lord but you say where was your love for us was not esau jacobs brother says the lord but jacob was loved by me
 and esau was hated and i sent destruction on his mountains and gave his heritage to the beasts of the waste land
 though edom says we are crushed down but we will come back building up the waste places this is what the lord of armies has said they may put up buildings but i will have them pulled down and they will be named the land of evil doing and the people against whom the lord keeps his wrath for ever
 and your eyes will see it and you will say the lord is great even outside the limits of israel
 a son gives honour to his father and a servant has fear of his master if then i am a father where is my honour and if i am a master where is the fear of me says the lord of armies to you o priests who give no value to my name and you say how have we not given value to your name
 you put unclean bread on my altar and you say how have we made it unclean by your saying the table of the lord is of no value
 and when you give what is blind for an offering it is no evil  and when you give what is damaged and ill it is no evil  give it now to your ruler will he be pleased with you or will you have his approval says the lord of armies
 and now make request for the grace of god so that he may have mercy on us this has been your doing will he give his approval to any of you says the lord of armies
 if only there was one among you who would see that the doors were shut so that you might not put a light to the fire on my altar for nothing  i have no pleasure in you says the lord of armies and i will not take an offering from your hands
 for from the coming up of the sun till its going down my name is great among the gentiles and in every place the smell of burning flesh is offered to my name and a clean offering for my name is great among the gentiles says the lord of armies
 but you make it unholy by saying the lords table has become unclean and his food is of no value
 and you say see what a weariness it is  and you let out your breath at it says the lord of armies and you have given what has been cut about by beasts and what is damaged in its feet and ill this is the offering you give will this be pleasing to me from your hands says the lord
 a curse on the false man who has a male in his flock and takes his oath and gives to the lord a damaged thing for i am a great king says the lord of armies and my name is to be feared among the gentiles
 and now o you priests this order is for you
 if you will not give ear and take it to heart to give glory to my name says the lord of armies then i will send the curse on you and will put a curse on your blessing truly even now i have put a curse on it because you do not take it to heart
 see i will have your arm cut off and will put waste on your faces even the waste from your feasts and you will be taken away with it
