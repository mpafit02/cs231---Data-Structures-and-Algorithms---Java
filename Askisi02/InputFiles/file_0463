 go up to the top of pisgah and turning your eyes to the west and the north to the south and the east see the land with your eyes for you are not to go over jordan
 but give my orders to joshua comforting him and making him strong for he is to go over jordan at the head of this people and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage
 so we were waiting in the valley facing beth peor
 now when all these things have come on you the blessing and the curse which i have put before you if the thought of them comes back to your minds when you are living among the nations where the lord your god has sent you
 and your hearts are turned again to the lord your god and you give ear to his word which i give you today you and your children with all your heart and with all your soul
 then the lord will have pity on you changing your fate and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go
 even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven the lord your god will go in search of you and take you back
 placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage and he will do you good increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were
 and the lord your god will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart so that loving him with all your heart and all your soul you may have life
 and the lord your god will put all these curses on those who are against you and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you
 and you will again give ear to the voice of the lord and do all his orders which i have given you today
 and the lord your god will make you fertile in all good things blessing the work of your hands and the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your land for the lord will have joy in you as he had in your fathers
 if you give ear to the voice of the lord your god keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law and turning to the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul
 for these orders which i have given you today are not strange and secret and are not far away
 they are not in heaven for you to say who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them
 and they are not across the sea for you to say who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them
 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart so that you may do it
 see i have put before you today life and good and death and evil
 in giving you orders today to have love for the lord your god to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions so that you may have life and be increased and that the blessing of the lord your god may be with you in the land where you are going the land of your heritage
 but if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods
 i give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going the land of your heritage on the other side of jordan
 let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that i have put before you life and death a blessing and a curse so take life for yourselves and for your seed
 in loving the lord your god hearing his voice and being true to him for he is your life and by him will your days be long so that you may go on living in the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
 so moses said all these things to israel
 then he said to them i am now a hundred and twenty years old i am no longer able to go out and come in and the lord has said to me you are not to go over jordan
 the lord your god he will go over before you he will send destruction on all those nations and you will take their land as your heritage and joshua will go over at your head as the lord has said
 the lord will do to them as he did to sihon and to og the kings of the amorites and to their land whom he put to destruction
 the lord will give them up into your hands and you are to do to them as i have given you orders
 be strong and take heart and have no fear of them for it is the lord your god who is going with you he will not take away his help from you
 then moses sent for joshua and before the eyes of all israel said to him be strong and take heart for you are to go with this people into the land which the lord by his oath to their fathers has given them by your help they will take it for their heritage
