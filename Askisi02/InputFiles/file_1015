 my hand will be his support my arm will give him strength
 the deceit of those who are against him will not overcome him he will not be troubled by the sons of evil
 i will have those who are against him broken before his face and his haters will be crushed under my blows
 but my faith and my mercy will be with him and in my name will his horn be lifted up
 i will put his hand in the sea and his right hand in the rivers
 he will say to me you are my father my god and the rock of my salvation
 and i will make him the first of my sons most high over the kings of the earth
 i will keep my mercy for him for ever my agreement with him will not be changed
 his seed will keep their place for ever his kingdom will be eternal like the heavens
 if his children give up my law and are not ruled by my decisions
 if my rules are broken and my orders are not kept
 then i will send punishment on them for their sin my rod will be the reward of their evil doing
 but i will not take away my mercy from him and will not be false to my faith
 i will be true to my agreement the things which have gone out of my lips will not be changed
 i have made an oath once by my holy name that i will not be false to david
 his seed will not come to an end for ever the seat of his kingdom will be like the sun before me
 it will be fixed for ever like the moon and the witness in heaven is true  selah 
 but you have put him away in disgust you have been angry with the king of your selection
 you have made your agreement with your servant of no effect you have had no respect for his crown it has come down even to the earth
 all his walls are broken down you have given his strong towers to destruction
 all those who come by take away his goods he is laughed at by his neighbours
 you have given power to the right hand of his haters you have made glad all those who are against him
 his sword is turned back you have not been his support in the fight
 you have put an end to his glory the seat of his kingdom has been levelled to the earth
 you have made him old before his time he is covered with shame  selah 
 how long o lord will you keep yourself for ever from our eyes how long will your wrath be burning like fire
 see how short my time is why have you made all men for no purpose
 what man now living will not see death will he be able to keep back his soul from the underworld  selah 
 lord where are your earlier mercies where is the oath which you made to david in unchanging faith
 keep in mind o lord the shame of your servants and how the bitter words of all the people have come into my heart
