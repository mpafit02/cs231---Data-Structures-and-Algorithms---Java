 and the children of israel made request to the lord  for the ark of the agreement of the lord was there in those days
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron was in his place before it  and said am i still to go on with the fight against the children of benjamin my brother or am i to give it up and the lord said go on for tomorrow i will give him into your hands
 so israel put men secretly all round gibeah to make a surprise attack on it
 and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in fighting order against gibeah as before
 and the children of benjamin went out against the people moving away from the town and as before at their first attack they put to death about thirty men of israel on the highways of which one goes up to beth el and the other to gibeah and in the open country
 and the children of benjamin said they are giving way before us as at first but the children of israel said let us go in flight and get them away from the town into the highways
 so all the men of israel got up and put themselves in fighting order at baal tamar and those who had been waiting secretly to make a surprise attack came rushing out of their place on the west of geba
 and they came in front of gibeah ten thousand of the best men in all israel and the fighting became more violent but the children of benjamin were not conscious that evil was coming on them
 then the lord sent sudden fear on benjamin before israel and that day the children of israel put to death twenty five thousand one hundred men of benjamin all of them swordsmen
 so the children of benjamin saw that they were overcome and the men of israel had given way before benjamin putting their faith in the watchers who were to make the surprise attack on gibeah
 and the watchers rushing on gibeah and overrunning it put all the town to the sword without mercy
 now the sign fixed between the men of israel and those making the surprise attack was that when they made a pillar of smoke go up from the town
 the men of israel were to make a turn about in the fight and benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of israel and were saying certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight
 then the sign went up out of the town in the pillar of smoke and the benjamites turning back saw all the town going up in smoke to heaven
 and the men of israel had made a turn about and the men of benjamin were overcome with fear for they saw that evil had overtaken them
 so turning their backs on the men of israel they went in the direction of the waste land but the fight overtook them and those who came out of the town were heading them off and putting them to the sword
 and crushing benjamin down they went after them driving them from nohah as far as the east side of gibeah
 eighteen thousand men of benjamin came to their death all strong men of war
 and turning they went in flight to the rock of rimmon in the waste land and on the highways five thousand of them were cut off by the men of israel who pushing on hard after them to geba put to death two thousand more
 so twenty five thousand of the swordsmen of benjamin came to their end that day all strong men of war
 but six hundred men turning back went in flight to the rock of rimmon in the waste land and were living on the rock of rimmon for four months
 and the men of israel turning again against the children of benjamin put to the sword without mercy all the towns and the cattle and everything there was burning every town which came into their hands
 now the men of israel had taken an oath in mizpah saying not one of us will give his daughter as a wife to benjamin
 and the people came to beth el waiting there till evening before god and gave themselves up to bitter weeping
 and they said o lord the god of israel why has this fate come on israel that today one tribe has been cut off from israel
 then on the day after the people got up early and made an altar there offering burned offerings and peace offerings
 and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel who did not come up to the lord at the meeting of all israel for they had taken a great oath that whoever did not come up to mizpah to the lord was to be put to death
 and the children of israel were moved with pity for benjamin their brother saying today one tribe has been cut off from israel
 what are we to do about wives for those who are still living for we have taken an oath by the lord that we will not give them our daughters for wives
 and they said which one of the tribes of israel did not come up to mizpah to the lord and it was seen that no one had come from jabesh gilead to the meeting
