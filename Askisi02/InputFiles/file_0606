 he put the servants and their children in front leah and her children after them and rachel and joseph at the back
 and he himself going before them went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother
 then esau came running up to him and folding him in his arms gave him a kiss and the two of them were overcome with weeping
 then esau lifting up his eyes saw the women and the children and said who are these with you and he said the children whom god in his mercy has given to your servant
 then the servants and their children came near and went down on their faces
 and leah came near with her children and then joseph and rachel and they did the same
 and he said what were all those herds which i saw on the way and jacob said they were an offering so that i might have grace in my lords eyes
 but esau said i have enough keep what is yours my brother for yourself
 and jacob said not so but if i have grace in your eyes take them as a sign of my love for i have seen your face as one may see the face of god and you have been pleased with me
 take my offering then with my blessing for god has been very good to me and i have enough so at his strong request he took it
 and he said let us go on our journey together and i will go in front
 but jacob said my lord may see that the children are only small and there are young ones in my flocks and herds one days over driving will be the destruction of all the flock
 do you my lord go on before your servant i will come on slowly at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go till i come to my lord at seir
 and esau said then keep some of my men with you and he said what need is there for that if my lord is pleased with me
 so esau turning back that day went on his way to seir
 and jacob went on to succoth where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle for this reason the place was named succoth
 so jacob came safely from paddan aram to the town of shechem in the land of canaan and put up his tents near the town
 and for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of hamor the builder of shechem the field in which he had put up his tents
 and there he put up an altar naming it el the god of israel
 now dinah the daughter whom leah had by jacob went out to see the women of that country
 and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite who was the chief of that land saw her he took her by force and had connection with her
 then his heart went out in love to dinah the daughter of jacob and he said comforting words to her
 and shechem said to hamor his father get me this girl for my wife
 now jacob had word of what shechem had done to his daughter but his sons were in the fields with the cattle and jacob said nothing till they came
 then hamor the father of shechem came out to have a talk with jacob
 now the sons of jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in israel by having connection with jacobs daughter and they said such a thing is not to be done
 but hamor said to them shechem my son is full of desire for your daughter will you then give her to him for a wife
 and let our two peoples be joined together give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves
 go on living with us and the country will be open to you do trade and get property there
 and shechem said to her father and her brothers if you will give ear to my request whatever you say i will give to you
