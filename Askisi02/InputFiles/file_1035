 and those who are turned back from going after the lord and those who have not made prayer to the lord or got directions from him
 let there be no sound before the lord god for the day of the lord is near for the lord has made ready an offering he has made his guests holy
 and it will come about in the day of the lords offering that i will send punishment on the rulers and the kings sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands
 and in that day i will send punishment on all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their masters house full of violent behaviour and deceit
 and in that day says the lord there will be the sound of a cry from the fish doorway and an outcry from the new town and a great thundering from the hills and cries of grief from the people of the hollow
 because of the downfall of all the people of canaan all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut off
 and it will come about at that time that i will go searching through jerusalem with lights and i will send punishment on the men who have become like wine stored over long who say to themselves the lord will not do good and will not do evil
 and their wealth will be violently taken away and their houses will be made waste they will go on building houses and never living in them and planting vine gardens but not drinking the wine from them
 the great day of the lord is near it is near and coming very quickly the bitter day of the lord is near coming on more quickly than a man of war
 that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and sorrow a day of wasting and destruction a day of dark night and deep shade a day of cloud and thick dark
 a day of sounding the horn and the war cry against the walled towns and the high towers
 and i will send trouble on men so that they will go about like the blind because they have done evil against the lord and their blood will be drained out like dust and their strength like waste
 even their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the lords wrath but all the land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath for he will put an end even suddenly to all who are living in the land
 come together make everyone come together o nation without shame
 before the lord sends you violently away in flight like the waste from the grain before the burning wrath of the lord comes on you before the day of the lords wrath comes on you
 make search for the lord all you quiet ones of the earth who have done what is right in his eyes make search for righteousness and a quiet heart it may be that you will be safely covered in the day of the lords wrath
 for gaza will be given up and ashkelon will become waste they will send ashdod out in the middle of the day and ekron will be uprooted
 sorrow to the people living by the sea the nation of the cherethites  the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will send destruction on you till there is no one living in you
 and the land by the sea will be grass land with houses for keepers of sheep and walled places for flocks
 the land by the sea will be for the rest of the children of judah by the sea they will give their flocks food in the houses of ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening for the lord their god will take them in hand and their fate will be changed
 my ears have been open to the bitter words of moab and the words of shame of the children of ammon which they have said against my people lifting themselves up against the limit of their land
 for this cause by my life says the lord of armies the god of israel truly moab will become like sodom and the children of ammon like gomorrah given up to waste plants and salt pools and unpeopled for ever the rest of my people will take their property the overflow of my nation will take their heritage
 this will be their fate because of their pride because they have said evil lifting themselves up against the people of the lord of armies
 the lord will let himself be seen by them for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble and men will go down before him in worship everyone from his place even all the sea lands of the nations
 and you ethiopians will be put to death by my sword
 and his hand will be stretched out against the north for the destruction of assyria and he will make nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land
 and herds will take their rest in the middle of her all the beasts of the valley the pelican and the porcupine will make their living places on the tops of its pillars the owl will be crying in the window the raven will be seen on the doorstep
 this is the town which was full of joy living without fear of danger saying in her heart i am and there is no other how has she been made waste a place for beasts to take their rest in  everyone who goes by her will make hisses waving his hand
 sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and unclean the cruel town 
 she gave no attention to the voice she had no use for teaching she put no faith in the lord she did not come near to her god
