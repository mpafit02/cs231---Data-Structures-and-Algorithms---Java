 do not go away till i come with my offering and put it before you and he said i will not go away before you come back
 then gideon went in and made ready a young goat and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot and he took it out to him under the oak tree and gave it to him there
 and the angel of god said to him take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there draining out the soup over them and he did so
 then the angel of the lord put out the stick which was in his hand touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it and a flame came up out of the rock burning up the meat and the cakes and the angel of the lord was seen no longer
 then gideon was certain that he was the angel of the lord and gideon said i am in fear o lord god  for i have seen the angel of the lord face to face
 but the lord said to him peace be with you have no fear you are in no danger of death
 then gideon made an altar there to the lord and gave it the name yahweh shalom to this day it is in ophrah of the abiezrites
 the same night the lord said to him take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old and after pulling down the altar of baal which is your fathers and cutting down the holy tree by its side
 make an altar to the lord your god on the top of this rock in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down
 then gideon took ten of his servants and did as the lord had said to him but fearing to do it by day because of his fathers people and the men of the town he did it by night
 and the men of the town got up early in the morning and they saw the altar of baal broken down and the holy tree which was by it cut down and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there
 and they said to one another who has done this thing and after searching with care they said gideon the son of joash has done this thing
 then the men of the town said to joash make your son come out to be put to death for pulling down the altar of baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it
 but joash said to all those who were attacking him will you take up the cause of baal will you be his saviour let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning if he is a god let him take up his cause himself because of the pulling down of his altar
 so that day he gave him the name of jerubbaal saying let baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down
 then all the midianites and the amalekites and the people of the east banding themselves together went over and put up their tents in the valley of jezreel
 but the spirit of the lord came on gideon and at the sound of his horn all abiezer came together after him
 and he sent through all manasseh and they came after him and he sent to asher and zebulun and naphtali and they came up and were joined to the others
 then gideon said to god if you are going to give israel salvation by my hand as you have said
 see i will put the wool of a sheep on the grain floor if there is dew on the wool only while all the earth is dry then i will be certain that it is your purpose to give israel salvation by my hand as you have said
 and it was so for he got up early on the morning after and twisting the wool in his hands he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool
 then gideon said to god do not be moved to wrath against me if i say only this let me make one more test with the wool let the wool now be dry while the earth is covered with dew
 and that night god did so for the wool was dry and there was dew on all the earth round it
 then jerubbaal that is gideon and all the people with him got up early and put up their tents by the side of the water spring of harod the tents of midian were on the north side of him under the hill of moreh in the valley
 and the lord said to gideon so great is the number of your people that if i give the midianites into their hands they will be uplifted in pride over me and will say i myself have been my saviour
 so now let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from mount galud so twenty two thousand of the people went back but there were still ten thousand
 then the lord said to gideon there are still more people than is necessary take them down to the water so that i may put them to the test for you there then whoever i say is to go with you will go and whoever i say is not to go will not go
 so he took the people down to the water and the lord said to gideon put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog and in the same way all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking
 now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water
 and the lord said to gideon by those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues i will give you salvation and give the midianites into your hands let the rest of the people go away every man to his place
