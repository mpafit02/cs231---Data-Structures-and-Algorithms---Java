 so david was king over all israel judging and giving right decisions for all his people
 and joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the army and jehoshaphat son of ahilud was keeper of the records
 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were priests and shavsha was the scribe
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief of those whose places were at the kings side
 now it came about after this that death came to nahash the king of the children of ammon and his son became king in his place
 and david said i will be a friend to hanun the son of nahash because his father was a friend to me so david sent men to him to give him words of comfort on account of his father and the servants of david came to hanun to the land of the children of ammon offering him comfort
 but the chiefs of the children of ammon said to hanun does it seem to you that david is honouring your father by sending comforters to you is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it
 so hanun took davids servants and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle sent them away
 then certain men went and gave david word of what had been done to them and he sent out with the purpose of meeting them for the men were greatly shamed and the king said keep where you are at jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war carriages and horsemen from mesopotamia and aram maacah and zobah
 so with this money they got thirty two thousand war carriages and the help of the king of maacah and his people who came and took up their position in front of medeba and the children of ammon came together from their towns for the fight
 and david hearing of it sent joab with all the army of fighting men
 so the children of ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field
 now when joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took all the best men of israel and put them in line against the aramaeans
 and the rest of the people he put in position against the children of ammon with abishai his brother at their head
 and he said if the aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then come to my help and if the children of ammon get the better of you i will come to your help
 take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our god and may the lord do what seems good to him
 so joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the aramaeans and they went in flight before him
 and when the children of ammon saw the flight of the aramaeans they themselves went in flight from abishai his brother and came into the town then joab came back to jerusalem
 and when the aramaeans saw that israel had overcome them they sent men to get the aramaeans who were on the other side of the river with shophach the captain of hadadezers army at their head
 and word of this was given to david and he got all israel together and went over jordan and came to helam and put his forces in position against them and when davids forces were in position against the aramaeans the fight was started
 and the aramaeans went in flight before israel and david put to the sword the men of seven thousand aramaean war carriages and forty thousand footmen and put to death shophach the captain of the army
 and when the servants of hadadezer saw that they were overcome by israel they made peace with david and became his servants and the aramaeans would give no more help to the children of ammon
