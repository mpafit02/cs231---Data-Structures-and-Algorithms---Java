 so this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see my face will be turned against you for evil for the cutting off of all judah
 and i will take the last of judah whose minds are fixed on going into the land of egypt and stopping there and they will all come to their end falling in the land of egypt by the sword and by being short of food and by disease death will overtake them from the least to the greatest death by the sword and by need of food they will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame
 for i will send punishment on those who are living in the land of egypt as i have sent punishment on jerusalem by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 so that not one of the rest of judah who have gone into the land of egypt and are living there will get away or keep his life to come back to the land of judah where they are hoping to come back and be living again for not one will come back but only those who are able to get away
 then all the men who had knowledge that their wives were burning perfumes to other gods and all the women who were present a great meeting answering jeremiah said
 as for the word which you have said to us in the name of the lord we will not give ear to you
 but we will certainly do every word which has gone out of our mouths burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her as we did we and our fathers and our kings and our rulers in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then we had food enough and did well and saw no evil
 but from the time when we gave up burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her we have been in need of all things and have been wasted by the sword and by need of food
 and the women said when we were burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her did we make cakes in her image and give her our drink offerings without the knowledge of our husbands
 then jeremiah said to all the people to the men and women and all the people who had given him that answer
 the perfumes which you have been burning in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem you and your fathers and your kings and your rulers and the people of the land had the lord no memory of them and did he not keep them in mind
 and the lord was no longer able to put up with the evil of your doings and the disgusting things you did and because of this your land has become a waste and a cause of wonder and a curse with no one living in it as at this day
 because you have been burning perfumes and sinning against the lord and have not given ear to the voice of the lord or gone in the way of his law or his rules or his orders for this reason this evil has come on you as it is today
 further jeremiah said to all the people and all the women give ear to the word of the lord all those of judah who are living in egypt
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said you women have said with your mouths and with your hands you have done what you said we will certainly give effect to the oaths we have made to have perfumes burned to the queen of heaven and drink offerings drained out to her then give effect to your oaths and do them
 and now give ear to the word of the lord all you of judah who are living in the land of egypt truly i have taken an oath by my great name says the lord that my name is no longer to be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying by the life of the lord god
 see i am watching over them for evil and not for good all the men of judah who are in the land of egypt will be wasted by the sword and by need of food till there is an end of them
 and those who get away safe from the sword will come back from the land of egypt to the land of judah a very small number and all the rest of judah who have gone into the land of egypt and are living there will see whose word has effect mine or theirs
 and this will be the sign to you says the lord that i will give you punishment in this place so that you may see that my words will certainly have effect against you for evil
 the lord has said see i will give up pharaoh hophra king of egypt into the hands of those who are fighting against him and desiring to take his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his hater who had designs against his life
 the words which jeremiah the prophet said to baruch the son of neriah when he put these words down in a book from the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah he said
 this is what the lord the god of israel has said of you o baruch
 you said sorrow is mine  for the lord has given me sorrow in addition to my pain i am tired with the sound of my sorrow and i get no rest
 this is what you are to say to him the lord has said truly the building which i put up will be broken down and that which was planted by me will be uprooted and this through all the land
 and as for you are you looking for great things for yourself have no desire for them for truly i will send evil on all flesh says the lord but your life i will keep safe from attack wherever you go
 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet about the nations
 of egypt about the army of pharaoh neco king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon overcame in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah
 get out the breastplate and body cover and come together to the fight
 make the horses ready and get up you horsemen and take your places with your head dresses make the spears sharp and put on the breastplates
 what have i seen they are overcome with fear and turned back their men of war are broken and have gone in flight not looking back fear is on every side says the lord
