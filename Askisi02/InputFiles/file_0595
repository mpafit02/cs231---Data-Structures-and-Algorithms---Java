 and said to the servant who is that man coming to us through the field and the servant said it is my master then she took her veil covering her face with it
 then the servant gave isaac the story of all he had done
 and isaac took rebekah into his tent and she became his wife and in his love for her isaac was comforted after his fathers death
 and abraham took another wife named keturah
 she became the mother of zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
 and jokshan became the father of sheba and dedan and from dedan came the asshurim and letushim and leummim
 and from midian came ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah all these were the offspring of keturah
 now abraham gave all his property to isaac
 but to the sons of his other women he gave offerings and sent them away while he was still living into the east country
 now the years of abrahams life were a hundred and seventy five
 and abraham came to his death an old man full of years and he was put to rest with his people
 and isaac and ishmael his sons put him to rest in the hollow rock of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite near mamre
 the same field which abraham got from the children of heth there abraham was put to rest with sarah his wife
 now after the death of abraham the blessing of god was with isaac his son
 now these are the generations of ishmael the son of abraham whose mother was hagar the egyptian the servant of sarah
 these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their generations ishmaels first son was nebaioth then kedar and adbeel and mibsam
 and mishma and dumah and massa
 hadad and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
 these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names in their towns and their tent circles twelve chiefs with their peoples
 and the years of ishmaels life were a hundred and thirty seven and he came to his end and was put to rest with his people
 and their country was from havilah to shur which is east of egypt they took their place to the east of all their brothers
 now these are the generations of abrahams son isaac
 isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the aramaean of paddan aram and the sister of laban the aramaean to be his wife
 isaac made prayer to the lord for his wife because she had no children and the lord gave ear to his prayer and rebekah became with child
 and the children were fighting together inside her and she said if it is to be so why am i like this so she went to put her question to the lord
 and the lord said to her two nations are in your body and two peoples will come to birth from you the one will be stronger than the other and the older will be the servant of the younger
 and when the time came for her to give birth there were two children in her body
 and the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair and they gave him the name of esau
 and after him his brother came out gripping esaus foot and he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them
 and the boys came to full growth and esau became a man of the open country an expert bowman but jacob was a quiet man living in tents
