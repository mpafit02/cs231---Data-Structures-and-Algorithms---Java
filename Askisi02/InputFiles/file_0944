 at his word their waters were turned to blood and he sent death on all their fish
 their land was full of frogs even in the rooms of the king
 he gave the word and there came the dog fly and insects over all the land
 he gave them ice for rain and flaming fire in their land
 he gave their vines and their fig trees to destruction and the trees of their land were broken down
 at his word the locusts came and young locusts more than might be numbered
 and put an end to all the plants of their land taking all the fruit of the earth for food
 he put to death the first child of every family in the land the first fruits of their strength
 he took his people out with silver and gold there was not one feeble person among them
 egypt was glad when they went for the fear of them had come down on them
 a cloud was stretched over them for a cover and he sent fire to give light in the night
 at the peoples request he sent birds and gave them the bread of heaven for food
 his hand made the rock open and the waters came streaming out they went down through the dry places like a river
 for he kept in mind his holy word and abraham his servant
 and he took his people out with joy the men of his selection with glad cries
 and gave them the lands of the nations and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage
 so that they might keep his orders and be true to his laws give praise to the lord
 let the lord be praised o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 who is able to give an account of the great acts of the lord or to make clear all his praise
 happy are they whose decisions are upright and he who does righteousness at all times
 keep me in mind o lord when you are good to your people o let your salvation come to me
 so that i may see the well being of the people of your selection and have a part in the joy of your nation and take pride in your heritage
 we are sinners like our fathers we have done wrong our acts are evil
 our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in egypt they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies but gave you cause for wrath at the sea even at the red sea
 but he was their saviour because of his name so that men might see his great power
 by his word the red sea was made dry and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land
 and he took them safely out of the hands of their haters and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them
 and the waters went over their haters all of them came to an end
 then they had faith in his words they gave him songs of praise
 but their memory of his works was short not waiting to be guided by him
