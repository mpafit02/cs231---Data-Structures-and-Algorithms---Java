 now when it came to his ears that john had been put in prison he went away to galilee
 and going away from nazareth he came and made his living place in capernaum which is by the sea in the country of zebulun and naphtali
 so that the word of the prophet isaiah might come true
 the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali by the way of the sea the other side of jordan galilee of the gentiles
 the people who were in the dark saw a great light and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up
 from that time jesus went about preaching and saying let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
 and when he was walking by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon whose other name was peter and andrew his brother who were putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
 and he said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
 and straight away they let go the nets and went after him
 and going on from there he saw two other brothers james the son of zebedee and john his brother in the boat with their father stitching up their nets and he said come
 and they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him
 and jesus went about in all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people
 and news of him went out through all syria and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads and those who had no power of moving and he made them well
 and there went after him great numbers from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judaea and from the other side of jordan
 and seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain and when he was seated his disciples came to him
 and with these words he gave them teaching saying
 happy are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven is theirs
 happy are those who are sad for they will be comforted
 happy are the gentle for the earth will be their heritage
 happy are those whose hearts desire is for righteousness for they will have their desire
 happy are those who have mercy for they will be given mercy
 happy are the clean in heart for they will see god
 happy are the peacemakers for they will be named sons of god
 happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs
 happy are you when men give you a bad name and are cruel to you and say all evil things against you falsely because of me
 be glad and full of joy for great is your reward in heaven for so were the prophets attacked who were before you
 you are the salt of the earth but if its taste goes from the salt how will you make it salt again it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men
 you are the light of the world a town put on a hill may be seen by all
 and a burning light is not put under a vessel but on its table so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house
 even so let your light be shining before men so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
