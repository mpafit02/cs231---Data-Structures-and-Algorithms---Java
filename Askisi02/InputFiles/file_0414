 asahel went running after abner not turning to the right or to the left
 then abner looking back said is it you asahel and he said it is i
 and abner said then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting men and take his arms but asahel would not be turned away from going after abner
 then again abner said to asahel go to one side do not keep on coming after me why will you make me put an end to you for then i will be shamed before your brother joab
 but still he did not go to one side so abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear so that the spear came out at his back and he went down on the earth wounded to death and all those who came to the place where asahel went down dead came to a stop
 but joab and abishai went after abner and the sun went down when they came to the hill of ammah which is to the east of the road through the waste land of geba
 and the men of benjamin came together after abner in one band and took their places on the top of a hill
 then crying out to joab abner said are fighting and destruction to go on for ever do you not see that the end will only be bitter how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen
 and joab said by the living god if you had not given the word the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning
 so joab had a horn sounded and all the people came to a stop and gave up going after israel and fighting them
 and all that night abner and his men went through the arabah they went over jordan and through all bithron and came to mahanaim
 and joab came back from fighting abner and when he had got all his men together it was seen that nineteen of davids men in addition to asahel were not with them
 but davids men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of benjamin and of abners men
 and they took asahels body and put it in the last resting place of his father in beth lehem and joab and his men travelling all night came to hebron at dawn
 now by chance there was present a good for nothing person named sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he sounding the horn said we have no part in david or any interest in the son of jesse let every man go to his tent o israel
 so all the men of israel turning away from david went after sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah were true to their king going with him from jordan as far as jerusalem
 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house and had them shut up and gave them the necessaries of life but did not go near them so they were shut up till the day of their death living as widows
 then the king said to amasa get all the men of judah together and in three days be here yourself
 so amasa went to get all the men of judah together but he took longer than the time david had given him
 and david said to abishai sheba the son of bichri will do us more damage than absalom did so take some of your lords servants and go after him before he makes himself safe in the walled towns and gets away before our eyes
 so there went after abishai joab and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the fighting men they went out of jerusalem to overtake sheba the son of bichri
 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa came face to face with them now joab had on his war dress and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover and while he was walking it came out falling to the earth
 and joab said to amasa is it well my brother and with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss
 but amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in joabs left hand and joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth and he did not give him another blow so joab and his brother abishai went on after sheba the son of bichri
 and one of joabs young men taking his place at amasas side said whoever is for joab and for david let him go after joab 
 and amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway and when the man saw that all the people were stopping he took amasa out of the highway and put him in a field with a cloth over him when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop
 when he had been taken off the road all the people went on after joab in search of sheba the son of bichri
 and sheba went through all the tribes of israel to abel of beth maacah and all the bichrites came together and went in after him
 and joab and his men got him shut up in abel of beth maacah and put up an earthwork against the town and all joabs men did their best to get the wall broken down
 then a wise woman got up on the wall and crying out from the town said give ear give ear say now to joab come near so that i may have talk with you
