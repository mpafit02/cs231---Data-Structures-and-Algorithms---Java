 for in one hour such great wealth has come to nothing and every shipmaster and all who are sailing on the sea and sailors and all who get their living by the sea were watching from far away
 and crying out when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what town is like the great town
 and they put dust on their heads and were sad weeping and crying and saying sorrow sorrow for the great town in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores  for in one hour she is made waste
 be glad over her heaven and you saints and apostles and prophets because she has been judged by god on your account
 and a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed and sent it into the sea saying so with a great fall will babylon the great town come to destruction and will not be seen any more at all
 and the voice of players and makers of music will never again be sounding in you and no worker expert in art will ever again be living in you and there will be no sound of the crushing of grain any more at all in you
 and never again will the shining of lights be seen in you and the voice of the newly married man and the bride will never again be sounding in you for your traders were the lords of the earth and by your evil powers were all the nations turned out of the right way
 and in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been put to death on the earth
 after these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven saying praise to the lord salvation and glory and power be to our god
 for true and upright are his decisions for by him has the evil woman been judged who made the earth unclean with the sins of her body and he has given her punishment for the blood of his servants
 and again they said praise to the lord and her smoke went up for ever and ever
 and the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to god who was seated on the high seat saying even so praise to the lord
 and a voice came from the high seat saying give praise to our god all you his servants small and great in whom is the fear of him
 and there came to my ears the voice of a great army like the sound of waters and the sound of loud thunders saying praise to the lord for the lord our god ruler of all is king
 let us be glad with delight and let us give glory to him because the time is come for the lamb to be married and his wife has made herself ready
 and to her it was given to be clothed in delicate linen clean and shining for the clean linen is the righteousness of the saints
 and he said to me put in the book happy are the guests at the bride feast of the lamb and he said to me these are the true words of god
 and i went on my face before his feet to give him worship and he said to me see you do it not i am a brother servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of jesus give worship to god for the witness of jesus is the spirit of the prophets word
 and the heaven was open and i saw a white horse and he who was seated on it was named certain and true and he is judging and making war in righteousness
 and his eyes are a flame of fire and crowns are on his head and he has a name in writing of which no man has knowledge but himself
 and he is clothed in a robe washed with blood and his name is the word of god
 and the armies which are in heaven went after him on white horses clothed in delicate linen white and clean
 and out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which he overcomes the nations and he has rule over them with a rod of iron and he is crushing with his feet the grapes of the strong wrath of god the ruler of all
 and on his robe and on his leg is a name king of kings and lord of lords
 and i saw an angel taking his place in the sun and he was crying with a loud voice saying to all the birds in flight in the heavens come together to the great feast of god
 so that you may take for your food the flesh of kings and of captains and of strong men and of horses and of those who are seated on them and the flesh of all men free and unfree small and great
 and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army
 and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image these two were put living into the sea of ever burning fire
 and the rest were put to death with the sword of him who was on the horse even the sword which came out of his mouth and all the birds were made full with their flesh
 to the angel of the church in ephesus say these things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights
