 and he took it with its king and all its towns and he put them to the sword giving every person in it to the curse all were put to death as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and its king
 so joshua overcame all the land the hill country and the south and the lowland and the mountain slopes and all their kings all were put to death and every living thing he gave up to the curse as the lord the god of israel had given him orders
 joshua overcame them from kadesh barnea to gaza and all the land of goshen as far as gibeon
 and all these kings and their land joshua took at the same time because the lord the god of israel was fighting for israel
 then joshua and all israel with him went back to their tents at gilgal
 now jabin king of hazor hearing of these things sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph
 and to the kings on the north in the hill country and in the arabah south of chinneroth and in the lowland and in the highlands of dor on the west
 and to the canaanites on the east and on the west and to the amorites and the hittites and the perizzites and the jebusites in the hill country and the hivites under hermon in the land of mizpah
 and they went out they and all their armies with them a great people in number like the sand on the seaside with horses and war carriages in great number
 and all these kings came together and put their forces in position at the waters of merom to make war on israel
 and the lord said to joshua have no fear of them for tomorrow at this time i will give them all up dead before israel you are to have the leg muscles of their horses cut and their war carriages burned with fire
 so joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of merom and made an attack on them
 and the lord gave them up into the hands of israel and they overcame them driving them back to great zidon and to misrephoth maim and into the valley of mizpeh to the east and they put them all to death no man got away safely
 and joshua did to them as the lord had said to him he had the leg muscles of their horses cut and their war carriages burned with fire
 at that time joshua went on to take hazor and put its king to the sword for in earlier times hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms
 and they put every person in it to death without mercy giving every living thing up to the curse and burning hazor
 and all the towns of these kings and all the kings joshua took and put them to the sword he gave them up to the curse as moses the servant of the lord had said
 as for the towns made on hills of earth not one was burned by israel but hazor which was burned by joshua
 and all the goods taken from these towns and their cattle the children of israel kept for themselves but every man they put to death without mercy till their destruction was complete and there was no one living
 as the lord had given orders to moses his servant so moses gave orders to joshua and so joshua did every order which the lord had given to moses was done
 so joshua took all that land the hill country and all the south and all the land of goshen and the lowland and the arabah the hill country of israel and its lowland
 from mount halak which goes up to seir as far as baal gad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he overcame and put to death
 for a long time joshua made war on all those kings
 not one town made peace with the children of israel but only the hivites of gibeon they took them all in war
 for the lord made them strong in heart to go to war against israel so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy and that destruction might come on them as the lord had given orders to moses
 and joshua came at that time and put an end to the anakim in the hill country in hebron in debir in anab and in all the hill country of judah and israel joshua gave them and their towns to the curse
 not one of the anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod some were still living
 so joshua took all the land as the lord had said to moses and joshua gave it to the children of israel as their heritage making division of it among them by their tribes and the land had rest from war
 now these are the kings of the land whom the children of israel overcame taking as their heritage their land on the east side of jordan from the valley of the arnon to mount hermon and all the arabah to the east
 sihon king of the amorites who was living in heshbon ruling from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and half gilead as far as the river jabbok the limits of the children of ammon
