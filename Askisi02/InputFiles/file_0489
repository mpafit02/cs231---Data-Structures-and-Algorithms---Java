 say to all the children of israel when they are come together in the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb by the number of their fathers families a lamb for every family
 and if the lamb is more than enough for the family let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man
 let your lamb be without a mark a male in its first year you may take it from among the sheep or the goats
 keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month when everyone who is of the children of israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark
 then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken
 and let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb cooked with fire in the oven together with unleavened bread and bitter tasting plants
 do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water but let it be cooked in the oven its head with its legs and its inside parts
 do not keep any of it till the morning anything which is not used is to be burned with fire
 and take your meal dressed as if for a journey with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands take it quickly it is the lords passover
 for on that night i will go through the land of egypt sending death on every first male child of man and of beast and judging all the gods of egypt i am the lord
 and the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are when i see the blood i will go over you and no evil will come on you for your destruction when my hand is on the land of egypt
 and this day is to be kept in your memories you are to keep it as a feast to the lord through all your generations as an order for ever
 for seven days let your food be unleavened bread from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses whoever takes bread with leaven in it from the first till the seventh day will be cut off from israel
 and on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyones food
 so keep the feast of unleavened bread for on this very day i have taken your armies out of the land of egypt this day then is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever
 in the first month from the evening of the fourteenth day let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty first day of the month
 for seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of israel if he is from another country or if he is an israelite by birth
 take nothing which has leaven in it wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes
 then moses sent for the chiefs of israel and said to them see that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families and let the passover lamb be put to death
 and take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning
 for the lord will go through the land sending death on the egyptians and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door the lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction
 and you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever
 and when you come into the land which the lord will make yours as he gave his word you are to keep this act of worship
 and when your children say to you what is the reason of this act of worship
 then you will say this is the offering of the lords passover for he went over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he sent death on the egyptians and kept our families safe and the people gave worship with bent heads
 and the children of israel went and did so as the lord had given orders to moses and aaron so they did
 and in the middle of the night the lord sent death on every first male child in the land of egypt from the child of pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison and the first births of all the cattle
 then pharaoh got up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and a great cry went up from egypt for there was not a house where someone was not dead
 and he sent for moses and aaron by night and said get up and go out from among my people you and the children of israel go and give worship to the lord as you have said
 and take your flocks and your herds as you have said and be gone and give me your blessing
