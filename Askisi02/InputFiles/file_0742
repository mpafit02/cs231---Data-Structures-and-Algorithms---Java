 he takes away his fear of danger and gives him support and his eyes are on his ways
 for a short time they are lifted up then they are gone they are made low they are pulled off like fruit and like the heads of grain they are cut off
 and if it is not so now who will make it clear that my words are false and that what i say is of no value
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 rule and power are his he makes peace in his high places
 is it possible for his armies to be numbered and on whom is not his light shining
 how then is it possible for man to be upright before god or how may he be clean who is a son of woman
 see even the moon is not bright and the stars are not clean in his eyes
 how much less man who is an insect and the son of man who is a worm 
 then job made answer and said
 how have you given help to him who has no power  how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength 
 how have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom and fully made clear true knowledge 
 to whom have your words been said and whose spirit came out from you
 the shades in the underworld are shaking the waters and those living in them
 the underworld is uncovered before him and destruction has no veil
 by his hand the north is stretched out in space and the earth is hanging on nothing
 by him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds and the cloud does not give way under them
 by him the face of his high seat is veiled and his cloud stretched out over it
 by him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters to the limits of the light and the dark
 the pillars of heaven are shaking and are overcome by his sharp words
 by his power the sea was made quiet and by his wisdom rahab was wounded
 by his wind the heavens become bright by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through
 see these are only the outskirts of his ways and how small is that which comes to our ears about him  but the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge
 and job again took up the word and said
 by the life of god who has taken away my right and of the ruler of all who has made my soul bitter
  for all my breath is still in me and the spirit of god is my life 
 truly there is no deceit in my lips and my tongue does not say what is false
 let it be far from me  i will certainly not say that you are right  i will come to death before i give up my righteousness
 i will keep it safe and will not let it go my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life
 let my hater be like the evil man and let him who comes against me be as the sinner
