 the religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our god and father is this to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble and to keep oneself untouched by the world
 my brothers if you have the faith of our lord jesus christ of glory do not take a mans position into account
 for if a man comes into your synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing
 and you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say come here and take this good place and you say to the poor man take up your position there or be seated at my feet
 is there not a division in your minds have you not become judges with evil thoughts
 give ear my dear brothers are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by god to have faith as their wealth and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him
 but you have put the poor man to shame are not the men of wealth rulers over you do they not take you by force before their judges
 do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you
 but if you keep the greatest law of all as it is given in the holy writings have love for your neighbour as for yourself you do well
 but if you take a mans position into account you do evil and are judged as evil doers by the law
 for anyone who keeps all the law but makes a slip in one point is judged to have gone against it all
 for he who said do not be untrue in married life is the same who said put no man to death now if you are not untrue in married life but you put a man to death the law is broken
 let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free
 for the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging
 what use is it my brothers for a man to say that he has faith if he does nothing will such a faith give him salvation
 if a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the days food
 and one of you says to them go in peace be warm and full of food but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need what profit is there in this
 even so faith without works is dead
 but a man may say you have faith and i have works let me see your faith without your works and i will make my faith clear to you by my works
 you have the belief that god is one and you do well the evil spirits have the same belief shaking with fear
 do you not see o foolish man that faith without works is of no use
 was not the righteousness of abraham our father judged by his works when he made an offering of isaac his son on the altar
 you see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them
 and the holy writings were put into effect which said and abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness and he was named the friend of god
 you see that a mans righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only
 and in the same way was not the righteousness of rahab the loose woman judged by her works when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way
 for as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead
 do not all be teachers my brothers because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others
 for we all go wrong in a number of things if a man never makes a slip in his talk then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control
 now if we put bits of iron into horses mouths so that they may be guided by us we have complete control of their bodies
