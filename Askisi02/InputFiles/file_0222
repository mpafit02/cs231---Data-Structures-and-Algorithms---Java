 and all the people made answer and said let his blood be on us and on our children
 then he let barabbas go free but after having jesus whipped he gave him up to be put to death on the cross
 then the rulers armed men took jesus into the open square and got all their band together
 and they took off his clothing and put on him a red robe
 and they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and put a rod in his right hand and they went down on their knees before him and made sport of him saying long life to the king of the jews
 and they put shame on him and gave him blows on the head with the rod
 and when they had made sport of him they took the robe off him and put his clothing on him and took him away to put him on the cross
 and while they were coming out they saw a man of cyrene simon by name and they made him go with them so that he might take up his cross
 and when they came to the place named golgotha that is to say dead mans head
 they gave him wine mixed with bitter drink and after tasting it he took no more
 and when they had put him on the cross they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
 and they were seated there watching him
 and they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing this is jesus the king of the jews
 then two thieves were put on crosses with him one on the right and one on the left
 and those who went by said bitter words to him shaking their heads and saying
 you who would give the temple to destruction and put it up again in three days get yourself free if you are the son of god come down from the cross
 in the same way the chief priests making sport of him with the scribes and those in authority said
 a saviour of others he has no salvation for himself if he is the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will have faith in him
 he put his faith in god let god be his saviour now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
 and the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him
 now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
 and about the ninth hour jesus gave a loud cry saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is my god my god why are you turned away from me
 and some of those who were near by hearing it said this man is crying to elijah
 and straight away one of them went quickly and took a sponge and made it full of bitter wine and put it on a rod and gave him drink
 and the rest said let him be let us see if elijah will come to his help
 and jesus gave another loud cry and gave up his spirit
 and the curtain of the temple was parted in two from end to end and there was an earth shock and the rocks were broken
 and the resting places of the dead came open and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life
 and coming out of their resting places after he had come again from the dead they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people
 now the captain and those who were with him watching jesus when they saw the earth shock and the things which were done were in great fear and said truly this was a son of god
