 send them away so that they may go into the country and small towns round about and get some food for themselves
 but he said to them in answer give them food yourselves and they said to him are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence and give it to them
 and he said to them how much bread have you go and see and when they had seen they said five cakes of bread and two fishes
 and he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass
 and they were placed in groups by hundreds and by fifties
 and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when the cakes were broken he gave them to the disciples to put before the people and he made division of the two fishes among them all
 and they all took of the food and had enough
 and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes
 and those who took of the bread were five thousand men
 and straight away he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side to beth saida while he himself sent the people away
 and after he had sent them away he went up into a mountain for prayer
 and by evening the boat was in the middle of the sea and he by himself on the land
 and seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water because the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he would have gone past them
 but they when they saw him walking on the sea took him for a spirit and gave a loud cry
 for they all saw him and were troubled but straight away he said to them take heart it is i have no fear
 and he went to them into the boat and the wind went down and they were full of wonder in themselves
 for it was not clear to them about the bread but their hearts were hard
 and when they had gone across they came to gennesaret and got their boat to land
 and when they had got out of the boat the people quickly had news of him
 and went running through all the country round about and took on their beds those who were ill to where it was said that he was
 and wherever he went into small towns or great towns or into the country they took those who were ill into the market places requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
 and there came together to him the pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from jerusalem
 and had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean that is unwashed hands
 now the pharisees and all the jews do not take food without washing their hands with care keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them
 and when they come from the market place they take no food till their hands are washed and a number of other orders there are which have been handed down to them to keep  washings of cups and pots and brass vessels
 and the pharisees and the scribes put the question to him why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers but take their bread with unwashed hands
 and he said well did isaiah say of you you false ones these people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
 but their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
 for turning away from the law of god you keep the rules of men
 and he said to them truly you put on one side the law of god so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you
