 for if not he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath and overtake him because the way is long and give him a death blow though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate
 and so i am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose
 and if the lord your god makes wide the limits of your land as he said in his oath to your fathers and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers
 if you keep and do all these orders which i give you today loving the lord your god and walking ever in his ways then let three more towns in addition to these three be marked out for you
 so that in all your land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage no man may be wrongly put to death for which you will be responsible
 but if any man has hate for his neighbour and waiting for him secretly makes an attack on him and gives him a blow causing his death and then goes in flight to one of these towns
 the responsible men of his town are to send and take him and give him up to the one who has the right of punishment to be put to death
 have no pity on him so that israel may be clear from the crime of putting a man to death without cause and it will be well for you
 your neighbours landmark which was put in its place by the men of old times is not to be moved or taken away in the land of your heritage which the lord your god is giving you
 one witness may not make a statement against a man in relation to any sin or wrongdoing which he has done on the word of two or three witnesses a question is to be judged
 if a false witness makes a statement against a man saying that he has done wrong
 then the two men between whom the argument has taken place are to come before the lord before the priests and judges who are then in power
 and the judges will have the question looked into with care and if the witness is seen to be false and to have made a false statement against his brother
 then do to him what it was his purpose to do to his brother and so put away the evil from among you
 and the rest of the people hearing of it will be full of fear and never again do such evil among you
 have no pity let life be given for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
 then we went back journeying into the waste land by the way to the red sea as the lord had said to me and we were a long time going round mount seir
 and the lord said to me
 you have been journeying round this mountain long enough now go to the north
 and give the people orders saying you are about to go through the land of your brothers the children of esau who are living in seir and they will have fear of you so take care what you do
 make no attack on them for i will not give you any of their land not even space enough for a mans foot because i have given mount seir to esau for his heritage
 you may get food for your needs from them for a price and water for drinking
 for the blessing of the lord your god has been on you in all the work of your hands he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste these forty years the lord your god has been with you and you have been short of nothing
 so we went on past our brothers the children of esau living in seir by the road through the arabah from elath and ezion geber and turning we went by the road through the waste land of moab
 and the lord said to me make no attack on moab and do not go to war with them for i will not give you any of his land because i have given ar to the children of lot for their heritage
  in the past the emim were living there a great people equal in numbers to the anakim and as tall
 they are numbered among the rephaim like the anakim but are named emim by the moabites
 and the horites in earlier times were living in seir but the children of esau took their place they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves as israel did to the land of his heritage which the lord gave them 
 get up now and go over the stream zered so we went over the stream zered
 thirty eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from kadesh barnea till we went over the stream zered by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead as the lord had said
