 and when they saw him they were surprised and his mother said to him son why have you done this to us see your father and i have been looking for you with sorrow
 and he said to them why were you looking for me was it not clear to you that my right place was in my fathers house
 and his words seemed strange to them
 and he went down with them and came to nazareth and did as he was ordered and his mother kept all these words in her heart
 and jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years and in grace before god and men
 and it came about on one of those days when he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the good news
 that the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority
 and in answer he said to them i will put a question to you and do you give me an answer
 the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
 and they said among themselves if we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him
 but if we say of men we will be stoned by the people for they are certain that john was a prophet
 and they made answer that they had no idea where it came from
 and jesus said and i will not make clear to you by what authority i do these things
 and he gave the people this story a man made a vine garden and gave the use of it to some field workers and went into another country for a long time
 and at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
 and he sent another servant and they gave blows to him in the same way and put shame on him and sent him away with nothing
 and he sent a third and they gave him wounds and put him out
 and the lord of the garden said what am i to do i will send my dearly loved son they may give respect to him
 but when the workmen saw him they said to one another this is he who will one day be the owner of the property let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
 and driving him out of the garden they put him to death now what will the lord do to these workmen
 he will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others and when he said this they said may it not be so
 but he looking on them said is it not in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same has become the chief stone of the building
 everyone falling on that stone will be broken but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust
 and the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour and they were in fear of the people for they saw that he had made up this story against them
 and they kept watch on him and sent out secret representatives who were acting the part of good men in order that they might get something from his words on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler
 and they put a question to him saying master we are certain that your teaching and your words are right and that you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of god
 is it right for us to make payment of taxes to caesar or not
 but he saw through their trick and said to them
 let me see a penny whose image and name are on it and they said caesars
 and he said then give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods
