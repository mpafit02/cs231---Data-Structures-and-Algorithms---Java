 if a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
 then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving punishment to the wrongdoer so that his sin may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
 and if your people israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers and requesting your grace in this house
 then give ear from heaven and let the sin of your people israel have forgiveness and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers
 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
 then give ear from heaven so that the sin of your servants and the sin of your people israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
 if there is no food in the land if there is disease if the fruits of the earth are damaged by heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble or whatever disease there may be
 whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
 then give ear from heaven your living place answering with forgiveness and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways  for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of the children of men 
 so that they may give you worship walking in your ways as long as they are living in the land which you gave to our fathers
 and as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people israel but comes from a far country because of the glory of your name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
 then give ear from heaven your living place and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people israel and may see that this house which i have made is truly named by your name
 if your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayers to you turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which i have put up for your name
 then give ear from heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
 if they do wrong against you  for no man is without sin  and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away prisoners to a land far off or near
 and if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners turning again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying we are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
 if with all their heart and soul they are turned again to you in the land where they are prisoners the land where they have been taken and make their prayers turning their eyes to their land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which i have made for your name
 then give ear from heaven your living place to their prayer and their cry and see right done to them answering with forgiveness your people who have done wrong against you
 now o my god may your eyes be open and your ears awake to the prayers made in this place
 up  now o lord god come back to your resting place you and the ark of your strength let your priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let your saints be glad in what is good
 o lord god let him whom you have taken for yourself never be given up by you keep in mind your mercies to david your servant
 now when solomons prayers were ended fire came down from heaven burning up all the offerings and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and the priests were not able to go into the house of the lord for the lords house was full of the glory of the lord
 and all the children of israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of the lord was on the house and they went down on their knees with their faces to the earth worshipping and praising the lord and saying he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 then the king and all the people made offerings before the lord
 king solomon made an offering of twenty two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people kept the feast of the opening of the house of god
 and the priests were in their places and the levites with their instruments of music for the lords song which david the king had made for the praise of the lord whose mercy is unchanging for ever when david gave praise by their hand and the priests were sounding horns before them and all israel were on their feet
 then solomon made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the lord offering the burned offerings there and the fat of the peace offerings for there was not room on the brass altar which solomon had made for all the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat
 so solomon kept the feast at that time for seven days and all israel with him a very great meeting for the people had come together from the way into hamath and from as far as the river of egypt
 and on the eighth day they had a holy meeting the offerings for making the altar holy went on for seven days and the feast for seven days
