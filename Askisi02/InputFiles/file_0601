 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and a delight to the eyes and to be desired to make one wise she took of its fruit and gave it to her husband
 and their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together
 and there came to them the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the evening wind and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden away from the eyes of the lord god
 and the voice of the lord god came to the man saying where are you
 and he said hearing your voice in the garden i was full of fear because i was without clothing and i kept myself from your eyes
 and he said who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing have you taken of the fruit of the tree which i said you were not to take
 and the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me the fruit of the tree and i took it
 and the lord god said to the woman what have you done and the woman said i was tricked by the deceit of the snake and i took it
 and the lord god said to the snake because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field you will go flat on the earth and dust will be your food all the days of your life
 and there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded
 to the woman he said great will be your pain in childbirth in sorrow will your children come to birth still your desire will be for your husband but he will be your master
 and to adam he said because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which i said you were not to take the earth is cursed on your account in pain you will get your food from it all your life
 thorns and waste plants will come up and the plants of the field will be your food
 with the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken for dust you are and to the dust you will go back
 and the man gave his wife the name of eve because she was the mother of all who have life
 and the lord god made for adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing
 and the lord god said now the man has become like one of us having knowledge of good and evil and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life he will go on living for ever
 so the lord god sent him out of the garden of eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken
 so he sent the man out and at the east of the garden of eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life
 now rachel because she had no children was full of envy of her sister and she said to jacob if you do not give me children i will not go on living
 but jacob was angry with rachel and said am i in the place of god who has kept your body from having fruit
 then she said here is my servant bilhah go in to her so that she may have a child on my knees and i may have a family by her
 so she gave him her servant bilhah as a wife and jacob went in to her
 and bilhah became with child and gave birth to a son
 then rachel said god has been my judge and has given ear to my voice and has given me a son so he was named dan
 and again bilhah rachels servant was with child and gave birth to a second son
 and rachel said i have had a great fight with my sister and i have overcome her and she gave the child the name naphtali
 when it was clear to leah that she would have no more children for a time she gave zilpah her servant to jacob as a wife
 and zilpah leahs servant gave birth to a son
 and leah said it has gone well for me and she gave him the name gad
