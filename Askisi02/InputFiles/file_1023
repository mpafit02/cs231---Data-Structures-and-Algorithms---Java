 and she took her rest at his feet till the morning and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another and he said let it not come to anyones knowledge that the woman came to the grain floor
 and he said take your robe stretching it out in your hands and she did so and he took six measures of grain and put them into it and gave it her to take and she went back to the town
 and when she came back her mother in law said to her how did it go with you my daughter and she gave her an account of all the man had done to her
 and she said he gave me these six measures of grain saying do not go back to your mother in law with nothing in your hands
 then she said do nothing now my daughter till you see what will come of this for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through
 and boaz went up to the public place of the town and took his seat there and the near relation of whom he had been talking came by and boaz crying out to him by name said come and be seated here and he came and was seated
 then he got ten of the responsible men of the town and said be seated here and they took their seats
 then he said to the near relation naomi who has come back from the country of moab is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother elimelechs
 and it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people if you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do then do it but if you will not do it say so to me now for there is no one who has the right to do it but you and after you myself and he said i will do it
 then boaz said on the day when you take this field you will have to take with it ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage
 and the near relation said i am not able to do the relations part for fear of damaging the heritage i have you may do it in my place for i am not able to do it myself
 now in earlier times this was the way in israel when property was taken over by a near relation or when there was a change of owner to make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other and this was a witness in israel
 so the near relation said to boaz take it for yourself and he took off his shoe
 then boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people you are witnesses today that i have taken at a price from naomi all the property which was elimelechs and everything which was chilions and mahlons
 and further i have taken ruth the moabitess who was the wife of mahlon to be my wife to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen and from the memory of his town you are witnesses this day
 and all the people who were in the public place and the responsible men said we are witnesses may the lord make this woman who is about to come into your house like rachel and leah which two were the builders of the house of israel and may you have wealth in ephrathah and be great in beth lehem
 may your family be like the family of perez the son whom tamar gave to judah from the offspring which the lord may give you by this young woman
 so boaz took ruth and she became his wife and he went in to her and the lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son
 and the women said to naomi a blessing on the lord who has not let you be this day without a near relation and may his name be great in israel
 he will be a giver of new life to you and your comforter when you are old for your daughter in law who in her love for you is better than seven sons has given birth to him
 and naomi took the child and put her arms round it and she took care of it
 and the women who were her neighbours gave it a name saying naomi has a child and they gave him the name of obed he is the father of jesse the father of david
 now these are the generations of perez perez became the father of hezron
 and hezron became the father of ram and ram became the father of amminadab
 and amminadab became the father of nahshon and nahshon became the father of salmon
 and salmon became the father of boaz and boaz became the father of obed
 and obed became the father of jesse and jesse became the father of david
 the song of songs which is solomons
 let him give me the kisses of his mouth for his love is better than wine
 sweet is the smell of your perfumes your name is as perfume running out so the young girls give you their love
