 and after hearing this moses was no longer angry
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 say to the children of israel these are the living things which you may have for food among all the beasts on the earth
 you may have as food any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again
 but at the same time of those beasts you may not take for food the camel because its food comes back but the horn of its foot is not parted in two it is unclean to you
 and the rock badger for the same reason is unclean to you
 and the hare because the horn of its foot is not parted in two is unclean to you
 and the pig is unclean to you because though the horn of its foot is parted its food does not come back
 their flesh may not be used for food and their dead bodies may not even be touched they are unclean to you
 these you may have for food of all things living in the water anything living in the water in the seas or rivers which has special parts for swimming and skin formed of thin plates may be used for food
 all other things living and moving in the water in the sea or in the rivers are a disgusting thing to you
 they may not be used for food and their dead bodies are disgusting to you
 anything in the water which has no special parts for swimming and no thin plates on its skin is disgusting to you
 and among birds these are to be disgusting to you and not to be used for food the eagle and the gier eagle and the ospray
 and the kite and the falcon and birds of that sort
 every raven and birds of that sort
 and the ostrich and the night hawk and the sea hawk and birds of that sort
 and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl
 and the water hen and the pelican and the vulture
 the stork and the heron and birds of that sort and the hoopoe and the bat
 every winged four footed thing which goes on the earth is disgusting to you
 but of the winged four footed things those which have long legs for jumping on the earth you may have for food
 such as all the different sorts of locust
 but all other winged four footed things which go on the earth are disgusting to you
 by these you will be made unclean anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean till evening
 whoever takes away the dead body of one of them is to have his clothing washed and will be unclean till evening
 every beast in the horn of whose foot there is not a complete division and whose food does not come back is unclean to you anyone touching one of these will be unclean
 any four footed beast which goes on the ball of its foot is unclean to you anyone touching the dead body of one of these will be unclean till evening
 anyone who takes away the dead body of one of these is to have his clothing washed and be unclean till evening
 and these are unclean to you among things which go low down on the earth the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard and animals of that sort
