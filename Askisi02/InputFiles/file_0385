 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah hoshea the son of elah became king over israel in samaria ruling for nine years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord though not like the kings of israel before him
 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings
 but hosheas broken faith became clear to the king of assyria because he had sent representatives to so king of egypt and did not send his offering to the king of assyria as he had done year by year so the king of assyria had him shut up in prison and put in chains
 then the king of assyria went through all the land and came up to samaria shutting it in with his forces for three years
 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and took israel away to assyria placing them in halah and in habor on the river gozan and in the towns of the medes
 and the wrath of the lord came on israel because they had done evil against the lord their god who took them out of the land of egypt from under the yoke of pharaoh king of egypt and had become worshippers of other gods
 living by the rules of the nations whom the lord had sent out from before the children of israel
 and the children of israel did secretly against the lord their god things which were not right building high places for themselves in all their towns from the tower of the watchmen to the walled town
 they put up pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree
 burning their offerings in all the high places as those nations did whom the lord sent away from before them they did evil things moving the lord to wrath
 and they made themselves servants of disgusting things though the lord had said you are not to do this
 and he gave witness to israel and judah by every prophet and seer saying come back from your evil ways and do my orders and keep my rules and be guided by the law which i gave to your fathers and sent to you by my servants the prophets
 and they did not give ear but became stiff necked like their fathers who had no faith in the lord their god
 and they went against his rules and the agreement which he made with their fathers and his laws which he gave them they gave themselves up to things without sense or value and became foolish like the nations round them of whom the lord had said do not as they do
 and turning their backs on all the orders which the lord had given them they made for themselves images of metal and the image of asherah worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to baal
 and they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the lord till he was moved to wrath
 so the lord was very angry with israel and his face was turned away from them only the tribe of judah kept its place
  but even judah did not keep the orders of the lord their god but were guided by the rules which israel had made
 so the lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of israel and sent trouble on them and gave them up into the hands of their attackers till he had sent them away from before his face 
 for israel was broken off from the family of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king who driving them away from the laws of the lord made them do a great sin
 and the children of israel went on with all the sins which jeroboam did they did not keep themselves from them
 till the lord put israel away from before his face as he had said by all his servants the prophets so israel was taken away from their land to assyria to this day
 then the king of assyria took men from babylon and from cuthah and avva and hamath and sepharvaim and put them in the towns of samaria in place of the children of israel so they got samaria for their heritage living in its towns
 now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the lord so the lord sent lions among them causing the death of some of them
 so they said to the king of assyria the nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of samaria have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land so he has sent lions among them causing their death because they have no knowledge of his way
 then the king of assyria gave orders saying send there one of the priests whom you took away and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land
 so one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from samaria came back and living in beth el became their teacher in the worship of the lord
 and every nation made gods for themselves and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in the towns where they were living
 the men of babylon made succoth benoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima
