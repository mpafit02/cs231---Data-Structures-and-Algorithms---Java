 in the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them he made designs of winged ones lions and palm trees with ornamented edges all round
 all the ten bases were made in this way after the same design of the same size and form
 and he made ten brass washing vessels everyone taking forty baths and measuring four cubits one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases
 and he put the bases by the house five on the right side and five on the left and he put the great water vessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
 and hiram made the pots and spades and the basins so hiram came to the end of all the work he did for king solomon in the house of the lord
 the two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
 and the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for every network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
 and the ten bases with the ten washing vessels on them
 and the great water vessel with the twelve oxen under it
 and the pots and the spades and the basins all the vessels which hiram made for king solomon for the house of the lord were of polished brass
 he made them of liquid metal in the lowland of jordan at the way across the river at adama between succoth and zarethan
 the weight of all these vessels was not measured because there was such a number of them it was not possible to get the weight of the brass
 and solomon had all the vessels made for use in the house of the lord the altar of gold and the gold table on which the holy bread was placed
 and the supports for the lights five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room of clear gold and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold
 and the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire trays all of gold and the pins on which the doors were turned the doors of the inner house the most holy place and the doors of the temple all of gold
 so all the work king solomon had done in the house of the lord was complete then solomon took the holy things which david his father had given the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the store houses of the house of the lord
 then solomon sent for all the responsible men of israel and all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of israel to come to him in jerusalem to take the ark of the lords agreement up out of the town of david which is zion
 and all the men of israel came together to king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim the seventh month
 and all the responsible men of israel came and the priests took up the ark
 they took up the ark of the lord and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the tent all these the priests and the levites took up
 and king solomon and all the men of israel who had come together there were with him before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
 and the priests took the ark of the agreement of the lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
 for their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
 the rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
 there was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which moses put there at horeb where the lord made an agreement with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt
 now when the priests had come out of the holy place the house of the lord was full of the cloud
 so that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of the lord was full of the glory of the lord
 then solomon said o lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a living place but your living place was not seen by men
 so i have made for you a living place a house in which you may be for ever present
 then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of israel and they were all on their feet together
