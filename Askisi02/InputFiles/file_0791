 and ephraim did not make the canaanites who were living in gezer go out but the canaanites went on living in gezer among them
 zebulun did not make the people of kitron or the people of nahalol go out but the canaanites went on living among them and were put to forced work
 and asher did not take the land of the people of acco or zidon or ahlab or achzib or helbah or aphik or rehob driving them out
 but the asherites went on living among the canaanites the people of the land without driving them out
 naphtali did not take the land of the people of beth shemesh or of beth anath driving them out but he was living among the canaanites in the land however the people of beth shemesh and beth anath were put to forced work
 and the children of dan were forced into the hill country by the amorites who would not let them come down into the valley
 for the amorites would go on living in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim but the children of joseph became stronger than they and put them to forced work
 and the limit of the edomites went from the slope of akrabbim from sela and up
 now after abimelech tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar became the saviour of israel he was living in shamir in the hill country of ephraim
 he was judge over israel for twenty three years and at his death his body was put to rest in the earth in shamir
 and after him came jair the gileadite who was judge over israel for twenty two years
 and he had thirty sons who went on thirty young asses and they had thirty towns in the land of gilead which are named havvoth jair to this day
 and at the death of jair his body was put to rest in the earth in kamon
 and again the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord worshipping the baals and astartes and the gods of aram and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines they gave up the lord and were servants to him no longer
 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon
 and that year the children of israel were crushed under their yoke for eighteen years all the children of israel on the other side of jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead were cruelly crushed down
 and the children of ammon went over jordan to make war against judah and benjamin and the house of ephraim and israel was in great trouble
 then the children of israel crying out to the lord said great is our sin against you for we have given up our god and have been servants to the baals
 and the lord said to the children of israel were not the egyptians and the amorites and the children of ammon and the philistines
 and the zidonians and amalek and midian crushing you down and in answer to your cry did i not give you salvation from their hands
 but for all this you have given me up and have been servants to other gods so i will be your saviour no longer
 go send up your cry for help to the gods of your selection let them be your saviours in the time of your trouble
 and the children of israel said to the lord we are sinners do to us whatever seems good to you only give us salvation this day
 so they put away the strange gods from among them and became the lords servants and his soul was angry because of the sorrows of israel
 then the children of ammon came together and put their army in position in gilead and the children of israel came together and put their army in position in mizpah
 and the people of israel said to one another who will be the first to make an attack on the children of ammon we will make him head over all gilead
 now jephthah the gileadite was a great man of war he was the son of a loose woman and gilead was his father
 and gileads wife gave birth to sons and when her sons became men they sent jephthah away saying you have no part in the heritage of our fathers house for you are the son of another woman
 so jephthah went in flight from his brothers and was living in the land of tob where a number of good for nothing men joining jephthah went out with him on his undertakings
 now after a time the children of ammon made war against israel
