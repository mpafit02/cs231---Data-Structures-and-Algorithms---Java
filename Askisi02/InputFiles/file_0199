 come to me all you who are troubled and weighted down with care and i will give you rest
 take my yoke on you and become like me for i am gentle and without pride and you will have rest for your souls
 for my yoke is good and the weight i take up is not hard
 at that time jesus went through the fields on the sabbath day and his disciples being in need of food were taking the heads of grain
 but the pharisees when they saw it said to him see your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the sabbath
 but he said to them have you no knowledge of what david did when he had need of food and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take but only for the priests
 or is it not said in the law how the sabbath is broken by the priests in the temple and they do no wrong
 but i say to you that a greater thing than the temple is here
 but if these words had been in your minds my desire is for mercy and not for offerings you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong
 for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
 and he went from there into their synagogue
 and there was a man with a dead hand and they put a question to him saying is it right to make a man well on the sabbath day so that they might have something against him
 and he said to them which of you having a sheep if it gets into a hole on the sabbath day will not put out a helping hand and get it back
 of how much more value is a man than a sheep  for this reason it is right to do good on the sabbath day
 then said he to the man put out your hand and he put it out and it was made as well as the other
 but the pharisees went out and made designs against him how they might put him to death
 and jesus having knowledge of this went away from there and a great number went after him and he made them all well
 ordering them not to give people word of him
 so that what was said by isaiah the prophet might come true
 see my servant the man of my selection my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will make my decision clear to the gentiles
 his coming will not be with fighting or loud cries and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets
 the crushed stem will not be broken by him and the feebly burning light will he not put out till he has made righteousness overcome all
 and in his name will the gentiles put their hope
 then they took to him one with an evil spirit who was blind and had no power of talking and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing
 and all the people were surprised and said is not this the son of david
 but the pharisees hearing of it said this man only sends evil spirits out of men by beelzebub the ruler of evil spirits
 and having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them every kingdom having division in itself is made waste and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction
 and if satan sends out satan he makes war against himself how then will he keep his kingdom
 and if i by beelzebub send evil spirits out of men by whom do your sons send them out so let them be your judges
