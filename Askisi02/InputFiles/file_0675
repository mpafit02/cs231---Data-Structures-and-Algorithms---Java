 they say why have we kept ourselves from food and you do not see it why have we kept ourselves from pleasure and you take no note of it if in the days when you keep from food you take the chance to do your business and get in your debts
 if keeping from food makes you quickly angry ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high
 have i given orders for such a day as this a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure is it only a question of the bent head of putting on haircloth and being seated in the dust is this what seems to you a holy day well pleasing to the lord
 is not this the holy day for which i have given orders to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the crushed go free and every yoke be broken
 is it not to give your bread to those in need and to let the poor who have no resting place come into your house to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh
 then will light be shining on you like the morning and your wounds will quickly be well and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the lord will come after you
 then at the sound of your voice the lord will give an answer at your cry he will say here am i if you take away from among you the yoke the putting out of the finger of shame and the evil word
 and if you give your bread to those in need of it so that the troubled one may have his desire then you will have light in the dark and your night will be as the full light of the sun
 and the lord will be your guide at all times in dry places he will give you water in full measure and will make strong your bones and you will be like a watered garden and like an ever flowing spring
 and your sons will be building again the old waste places you will make strong the bases of old generations and you will be named he who puts up the broken walls and he who makes ready the ways for use
 if you keep the sabbath with care not doing your business on my holy day and if the sabbath seems to you a delight and the new moon of the lord a thing to be honoured and if you give respect to him by not doing your business or going after your pleasure or saying unholy words
 then the lord will be your delight and i will put you on the high places of the earth and i will give you the heritage of jacob your father for the mouth of the lord has said it
 truly the lords hand has not become short so that he is unable to give salvation and his ear is not shut from hearing
 but your sins have come between you and your god and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you so that he will give you no answer
 for your hands are unclean with blood and your fingers with sin your lips have said false things and your tongue gives out deceit
 no one puts forward an upright cause or gives a true decision their hope is in deceit and their words are false they are with child with sin and give birth to evil
 they give birth to snakes eggs and make spiders threads whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison snake
 their twisted threads will not make clothing and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves their works are works of sin and violent acts are in their hands
 their feet go quickly to evil and they take delight in the death of the upright their thoughts are thoughts of sin wasting and destruction are in their ways
 they have no knowledge of the way of peace and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour they have made for themselves ways which are not straight whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace
 for this cause our right is far from us and righteousness does not overtake us we are looking for light but there is only the dark for the shining of the sun but our way is in the night
 we go on our way like blind men feeling for the wall even like those who have no eyes we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening our place is in the dark like dead men
 we make noises of grief like bears and sad sounds like doves we are looking for our right but it is not there for salvation but it is far from us
 for our evil doings are increased before you and our sins give witness against us for our evil doings are with us and we have knowledge of our sins
 we have gone against the lord and been false to him turning away from our god our words have been uncontrolled and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit
 and the right is turned back and righteousness is far away for good faith is not to be seen in the public places and upright behaviour may not come into the town
 yes faith is gone and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel and the lord saw it and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause
 and he saw that there was no man and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause so his arm gave salvation and he made righteousness his support
 yes he put on righteousness as a breastplate and salvation as a head dress and he put on punishment as clothing and wrath as a robe
 he will give them the right reward of their doings wrath to his attackers punishment to his haters and even on the sea lands he will send punishment
