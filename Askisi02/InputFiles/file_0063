 so he took him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner made a request to me to take this young man to you for he has something to say to you
 and the chief took him by the hand and going on one side said to him privately what is it you have to say to me
 and he said the jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for paul to be taken on the day after this into the sanhedrin to be questioned in greater detail
 but do not give way to them for more than forty of them are waiting for him having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death and now they are ready waiting for your order
 so the chief captain let the young man go saying to him do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things
 and he sent for two captains and said make ready two hundred men with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to caesarea at the third hour of the night
 and get beasts so that they may put paul on them and take him safely to felix the ruler
 and he sent a letter in these words
 claudius lysias to the most noble ruler felix peace be with you
 this man was taken by the jews and was about to be put to death by them when i came on them with the army and took him out of danger having knowledge that he was a roman
 and desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him i took him down to their sanhedrin
 then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death
 and when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man i sent him straight away to you giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you
 so the armed men as they were ordered took paul and came by night to antipatris
 but on the day after they sent the horsemen on with him and went back to their place
 and they when they came to caesarea gave the letter to the ruler and took paul before him
 and after reading it he said what part of the country do you come from and hearing that he was from cilicia
 i will give hearing to your cause he said when those who are against you have come and he gave orders for him to be kept in herods praetorium
 and after five days the high priest ananias came with certain of the rulers and an expert talker one tertullus and they made a statement to felix against paul
 and when he had been sent for tertullus starting his statement said because by you we are living in peace and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation
 in all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you most noble felix
 but so that i may not make you tired i make a request to you of your mercy to give hearing to a short statement
 for this man in our opinion is a cause of trouble a maker of attacks on the government among jews through all the empire and a chief mover in the society of the nazarenes
 who in addition was attempting to make the temple unclean whom we took
   
 and from whom you will be able by questioning him yourself to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him
 and the jews were in agreement with his statement saying that these things were so
 then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer paul said because i have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years i am glad to make my answer
 seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when i came up to jerusalem for worship
 and they have not seen me in argument with any man in the temple or working up the feelings of the people in the synagogues or in the town
