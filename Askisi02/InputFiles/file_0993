 they were in great fear where there was no cause for fear for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by god you have put them to shame because god has no desire for them
 may the salvation of israel come out of zion  when the fate of his people is changed by god jacob will have joy and israel will be glad
 &ltto the chief music maker on neginoth maschil of david when the ziphites came and said to saul is not david keeping himself secret among us&gt let your name be my salvation o god let my cause be judged by your strength
 let my prayer come before you o god give ear to the words of my mouth
 for men who are going after me have come out against me violent men are purposing to take my soul they have not put god before their eyes  selah 
 see god is my helper the lord is the great supporter of my soul
 let the evil works of my haters come back on them again let them be cut off by your good faith
 freely will i make my offerings to you i will give praise to your name o lord for it is good
 because it has been my saviour from all my trouble and my eyes have seen the punishment of my haters
 &ltto the chief music maker on neginoth maschil of david&gt give hearing to my prayer o god and let not your ear be shut against my request
 give thought to me and let my prayer be answered i have been made low in sorrow
 i am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones because of the loud cry of the evil doers for they put a weight of evil on me and they are cruel in their hate for me
 my heart is deeply wounded and the fear of death has come on me
 fear and shaking have come over me with deep fear i am covered
 and i said if only i had wings like a dove  for then i would go in flight from here and be at rest
 i would go wandering far away living in the waste land  selah 
 i would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind
 send destruction on them o lord make a division of tongues among them for i have seen fighting and violent acts in the town
 by day and night they go round the town on the walls trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it
 evil is there cruel rule and deceit are ever in the streets
 for it was not my hater who said evil of me that would have been no grief to me it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me or i would have kept myself from him in a secret place
 but it was you my equal my guide my well loved friend
 we had loving talk together and went to the house of god in company
 let the hand of death come on them suddenly and let them go down living into the underworld because evil is in their houses and in their hearts
 as for me i will make my prayer to god and he will be my saviour
 in the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day i will make my prayer with sounds of grief and my voice will come to his ears
 he has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me and given it peace for great numbers were against me
 god will give thought to me he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them  selah  because they are unchanged they have no fear of god
 he has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him he has not kept his agreement
 the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil but they were sharp swords
