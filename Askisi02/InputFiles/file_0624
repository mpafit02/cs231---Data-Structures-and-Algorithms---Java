 simeon and levi are brothers deceit and force are their secret designs
 take no part in their secrets o my soul keep far away o my heart from their meetings for in their wrath they put men to death and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded

 even by the god of your father who will be your help and by the ruler of all who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body

 benjamin is a wolf searching for meat in the morning he takes his food and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken
 these are the twelve tribes of israel and these are the words their father said to them blessing them to every one he gave his blessing
 and he gave orders to them saying put me to rest with my people and with my fathers in the hollow of the rock in the field of ephron the hittite
 in the rock in the field of machpelah near mamre in the land of canaan which abraham got from ephron the hittite to be his resting place
 there abraham and sarah his wife were put to rest and there they put isaac and rebekah his wife and there i put leah to rest
 in the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of heth
