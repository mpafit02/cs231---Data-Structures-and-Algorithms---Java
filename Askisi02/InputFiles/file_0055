 and there he came across a certain jew named aquila a man of pontus by birth who not long before had come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had given orders that all jews were to go away from rome and he came to them
 and because he was of the same trade he was living with them and they did their work together for by trade they were tent makers
 and every sabbath he had discussions in the synagogue turning jews and greeks to the faith
 and when silas and timothy came down from macedonia paul was completely given up to the word preaching to the jews that the christ was jesus
 and when they put themselves against him and said evil words he said shaking his clothing your blood be on your heads i am clean from now i will go to the gentiles
 and moving from there he went into the house of a man named titus justus a god fearing man whose house was very near the synagogue
 and crispus the ruler of the synagogue with all his family had faith in the lord and a great number of the people of corinth hearing the word had faith and were given baptism
 and the lord said to paul in the night in a vision have no fear and go on preaching
 for i am with you and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage for i have a number of people in this town
 and he was there for a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
 but when gallio was ruler of achaia all the jews together made an attack on paul and took him to the judges seat
 saying this man is teaching the people to give worship to god in a way which is against the law
 but when paul was about to say something gallio said to the jews if this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing
 but if it is a question of words or names or of your law see to it yourselves i will not be a judge of such things
 and he sent them away from the judges seat
 and they all made an attack on sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and gave him blows before the judges seat but gallio gave no attention to these things
 and paul after waiting some days went away from the brothers and went by ship to syria priscilla and aquila being with him and he had had his hair cut off in cenchrea for he had taken an oath
 and they came down to ephesus and he left them there and he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews
 and being requested by them to be there for a longer time he said no
 and went from them saying i will come back to you if god lets me and he took ship from ephesus
 and when he had come to land at caesarea he went to see the church and then went down to antioch
 and having been there for some time he went through the country of galatia and phrygia in order making the disciples strong in the faith
 now a certain jew named apollos an alexandrian by birth and a man of learning came to ephesus and he had great knowledge of the holy writings
 this man had been trained in the way of the lord and burning in spirit he gave himself up to teaching the facts about jesus though he had knowledge only of johns baptism
 and he was preaching in the synagogue without fear but priscilla and aquila hearing his words took him in and gave him fuller teaching about the way of god
 and when he had a desire to go over into achaia the brothers gave him help and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them and when he had come he gave much help to those who had faith through grace
 for he overcame the jews in public discussion making clear from the holy writings that the christ was jesus
 and it came about that while apollos was at corinth paul having gone through the higher country came to ephesus where there were certain disciples
 and he said to them did you get the holy spirit when you had faith and they said to him no we have had no knowledge of the holy spirit
 and he said what sort of baptism did you have and they said the baptism of john
