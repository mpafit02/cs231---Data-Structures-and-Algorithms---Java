 and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took their vessels and put fire in them and perfume burning strange fire before the lord which he had not given them orders to do
 and fire came out from before the lord burning them up and causing their destruction before the lord
 then moses said to aaron this is what the lord said i will be holy in the eyes of all those who come near to me and i will be honoured before all the people and aaron said nothing
 and moses sent for mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the brother of aarons father and said to them come near and take your brothers away from before the holy place outside the tent circle
 so they came and took them in their coats outside the tent circle as moses had said
 and moses said to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons do not let your hair be loose and give no signs of grief so that death may not overtake you and his wrath come on all the people but let there be weeping among your brothers and all the house of israel for this burning of the lords fire
 and do not go out from the door of the tent of meeting or death will come to you for the holy oil of the lord is on you and they did as moses said
 and the lord said to aaron
 take no wine or strong drink you or your sons with you when you go into the tent of meeting that it may not be the cause of death to you this is an order for ever through all your generations
 and make a division between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean
 teaching the children of israel all the laws which the lord has given them by the hand of moses
 and moses said to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons who were still living take the rest of the meal offering from the offerings of the lord made by fire and take it for your food without leaven at the side of the altar for it is most holy
 it is to be for your food in a holy place because it is your right and your sons right from the offerings of the lord made by fire for so am i ordered
 and the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high you are to take as your food in a clean place you and your sons and your daughters with you for they are given to you as your right and your sons right from the peace offerings of the children of israel
 let them take the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high with the fat of the burned offering to be waved for a wave offering before the lord and this will be for you and for your sons with you for a right for ever as the lord has given orders
 and moses was looking for the goat of the sin offering but it was burned and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron who were still living saying
 why did you not make a meal of the sin offering in the holy place for it is most holy and he has given it to you so that the sin of the people may be put on it to take away their sin before the lord
 see its blood was not taken into the holy place certainly it was right for you to have taken it as food in the holy place as i gave orders
 and aaron said to moses you have seen that today they have made their sin offering and their burned offering before the lord and such things as these have come on me if i had taken the sin offering as food today would it have been pleasing to the lord
