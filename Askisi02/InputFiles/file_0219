 but jesus seeing it said to them why are you troubling the woman she has done a kind act to me
 for the poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
 for in putting this perfume on my body she did it to make me ready for my last resting place
 truly i say to you wherever this good news goes out in all the world what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
 then one of the twelve who was named judas iscariot went to the chief priests and said
 what will you give me if i give him up to you and the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver
 and from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands
 now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where are we to make ready for you to take the passover meal
 and he said to them go into the town to such a man and say to him the master says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
 and the disciples did as jesus had said to them and they made ready the passover
 now when evening was come he was seated at table with the twelve disciples
 and while they were taking food he said truly i say to you that one of you will be false to me
 and they were very said and said to him one by one is it i lord
 and he made answer and said he who puts his hand into the plate with me the same will be false to me
 the son of man goes even as the writings say of him but a curse is on that man through whom the son of man is given up it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world
 and judas who was false to him made answer and said is it i master he says to him yes
 and when they were taking food jesus took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said take it this is my body
 and he took a cup and having given praise he gave it to them saying
 take of it all of you for this is my blood of the testament which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins
 but i say to you that from now i will not take of this fruit of the vine till that day when i take it new with you in my fathers kingdom
 and after a song of praise to god they went out to the mountain of olives
 then said jesus to them all of you will be turned away from me this night for it is said in the writings i will put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight
 but after i am come back from the dead i will go before you into galilee
 but peter made answer and said to him though all may be turned away from you i will never be turned away
 jesus said to him truly i say to you that this night before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 peter says to him even if i am put to death with you i will not be false to you so said all the disciples
 then comes jesus with them to a place named gethsemane and says to his disciples be seated here while i go over there for prayer
 and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and became sad and very troubled
 then says he to them my soul is very sad even to death keep watch with me here
 and he went forward a little and falling down on his face in prayer he said o my father if it is possible let this cup go from me but let not my pleasure but yours be done
