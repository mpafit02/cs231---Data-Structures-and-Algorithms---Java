 for this cause all hands will be feeble and every heart of man be turned to water
 their hearts will be full of fear pains and sorrows will overcome them they will be in pain like a woman in childbirth they will be shocked at one another their faces will be like flames
 see the day of the lord is coming cruel with wrath and burning passion to make the land a waste driving the sinners in it to destruction
 for the stars of heaven and its bright armies will not give their light the sun will be made dark in his journey through the heaven and the moon will keep back her light
 and i will send punishment on the world for its evil and on the sinners for their wrongdoing and i will put an end to all pride and will make low the power of the cruel
 i will make men so small in number that a man will be harder to get than gold even the best gold of ophir
 for this cause the heavens will be shaking and the earth will be moved out of its place in the wrath of the lord of armies and in the day of his burning passion
 and it will be that like a roe in flight and like wandering sheep they will go every man to his people and to his land
 everyone who is overtaken will have a spear put through him and everyone who goes in flight will be put to the sword
 their young children will be broken up before their eyes their goods will be taken away and their wives made the property of others
 see i am driving the medes against them who put no value on silver and have no pleasure in gold
 in their hands are bows and spears they are cruel violently putting the young men to death and crushing the young women they have no pity for children and no mercy for the fruit of the body
 and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beautiful town which is the pride of the chaldaeans will be like gods destruction of sodom and gomorrah
 people will never be living in it again and it will have no more men from generation to generation the arab will not put up his tent there and those who keep sheep will not make it a resting place for their flocks
 but the beasts of the waste land will have their holes there and the houses will be full of crying jackals and ostriches will have their place there and evil spirits will be dancing there
 and wolves will be answering one another in their towers and jackals in their houses of pleasure her time is near and her days of power will quickly be ended
 for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will again make israel his special people and will put them in their land and the man from a strange country will take his place among them and be joined to the family of jacob
 and the people will take them with them to their place and the children of israel will give them a heritage in the lords land as men servants and women servants making them prisoners whose prisoners they were and they will be rulers over their masters
 and it will be in the day when the lord gives you rest from your sorrow and from your trouble and from the hard yoke which they had put on you
 that you will take up this bitter song against the king of babylon and say how has the cruel overseer come to an end  he who was lifted up in pride is cut off
 the stick of the evil doers the rod of the rulers is broken by the lord
 he whose rod was on the peoples with an unending wrath ruling the nations in passion with an uncontrolled rule
 all the earth is at rest and is quiet they are bursting into song
 even the trees of the wood are glad over you the trees of lebanon saying from the time of your fall no wood cutter has come up against us with an axe
 the underworld is moved at your coming the shades of the dead are awake before you even the strong ones of the earth all the kings of the world have got up from their seats
 they all make answer and say to you have you become feeble like us have you been made even as we are
 your pride has gone down into the underworld and the noise of your instruments of music the worms are under you and your body is covered with them
 how great is your fall from heaven o shining one son of the morning  how are you cut down to the earth low among the dead bodies 
 for you said in your heart i will go up to heaven i will make my seat higher than the stars of god i will take my place on the mountain of the meeting place of the gods in the inmost parts of the north
 i will go higher than the clouds i will be like the most high
