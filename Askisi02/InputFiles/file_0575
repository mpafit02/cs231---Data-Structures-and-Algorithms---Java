 further there have been great kings in jerusalem ruling over all the country across the river to whom they gave taxes and payments in goods and forced payments
 give an order now that these men are to do nothing more and that the building of the town is to be stopped till i give an order
 be certain to do this with all care do not let trouble be increased to the kings damage
 then after reading the kings letter rehum and shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to jerusalem to the jews and had them stopped by force
 so the work of the house of god at jerusalem came to an end so it was stopped till the second year of the rule of darius king of persia
 now the prophets haggai and zechariah the son of iddo were preaching to the jews in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel
 then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak got up and made a start at building the house of god at jerusalem and the prophets of god were with them helping them
 at the same time tattenai ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and their men came to them and said who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall
 then they said these words to them what are the names of the men who are at work on this building
 but the eye of their god was on the chiefs of the jews and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before darius and an answer had come by letter about it
 this is a copy of the letter which tattenai the ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and his friends the apharsachites living across the river sent to darius the king
 they sent him a letter saying to darius the king all peace
 this is to give the king word that we went into the land of judah to the house of the great god which is made of great stones and has its walls supported with wood and the work is going on with industry and they are doing it well
 then we said to the men responsible who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls
 and we made request for their names so that we might send you word and give you the names of the men at the head of them
 and they made answer to us saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of israel
 but when the god of heaven was moved to wrath by our fathers he gave them up into the hands of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon the chaldaean who sent destruction on this house and took the people away into babylon
 but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of god
 and the gold and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which was in jerusalem and put into the house of his god in babylon these cyrus the king took from the house of his god in babylon and gave to one named sheshbazzar whom he had made ruler
 and he said to him go take these vessels and put them in the temple in jerusalem and let the house of god be put up again in its place
 then this same sheshbazzar came and put the house of god in jerusalem on its bases and from that time till now the building has been going on but it is still not complete
 so now if it seems good to the king let search be made in the kings store house at babylon to see if it is true that an order was given by cyrus the king for the building of this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business
 then darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records where the things of value were stored up in babylon
 and at achmetha in the great house of the king in the land of media they came across a roll in which this statement was put on record
 in the first year of cyrus the king cyrus the king made an order in connection with the house of god at jerusalem let the house be put up the place where they make offerings and let the earth for the bases be put in place let it be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide
 with three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports and let the necessary money be given out of the kings store house
 and let the gold and silver vessels from the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took from the temple at jerusalem to babylon be given back and taken again to the temple at jerusalem every one in its place and put them in the house of god
 so now tattenai ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and your people the apharsachites across the river keep far from that place
 let the work of this house of god go on let the ruler of the jews and their responsible men put up this house of god in its place
 further i give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the jews in connection with the building of this house of god that from the kings wealth that is from the taxes got together in the land over the river the money needed is to be given to these men readily so that their work may not be stopped
