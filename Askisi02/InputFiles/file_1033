 and those who are far away will come and be builders in the temple of the lord and it will be clear to you that the lord of armies has sent me to you
 and it came about in the fourth year of king darius that the word of the lord came to zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month the month chislev
 now they of beth el had sent sharezer and regem melech to make a request for grace from the lord
 and to say to the priests of the house of the lord of armies and to the prophets am i to go on weeping in the fifth month separating myself as i have done in past years
 then the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 say to all the people of the land and to the priests when you went without food and gave yourselves to grief in the fifth and the seventh months for these seventy years did you ever do it because of me
 and when you are feasting and drinking are you not doing it only for yourselves
 are not these the words which the lord said to you by the earlier prophets when jerusalem was full of people and wealth and the towns round about her and the south and the lowland were peopled
 and the word of the lord came to zechariah saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said let your judging be upright and done in good faith let every man have mercy and pity for his brother
 do not be hard on the widow or the child without a father on the man from a strange country or on the poor let there be no evil thought in your heart against your brother
 but they would not give attention turning their backs and stopping their ears from hearing
 and they made their hearts like the hardest stone so that they might not give ear to the law and the words which the lord of armies had said by the earlier prophets and there came great wrath from the lord of armies
 and it came about that as they would not give ear to his voice so i would not give ear to their voice says the lord of armies
 but with a storm wind i sent them in flight among all the nations of whom they had no knowledge so the land was waste after them so that no man went through or came back for they had made waste the desired land
 and the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 these are the words of the lord of armies i am angry about the fate of zion i am angry about her with great wrath
 this is what the lord has said i have come back to zion and will make my living place in jerusalem and jerusalem will be named the town of good faith and the mountain of the lord of armies the holy mountain
 this is what the lord of armies has said there will again be old men and old women seated in the open spaces of jerusalem every man with his stick in his hand because he is so old
 and the open spaces of the town will be full of boys and girls playing in its open spaces
 this is what the lord of armies has said if this is a wonder to the rest of this people is it a wonder to me says the lord of armies
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will be the saviour of my people from the east country and from the west country
 and i will make them come and be living in jerusalem and they will be to me a people and i will be to them a god in good faith and in righteousness
 this is what the lord of armies has said let your hands be strong you who are now hearing these words from the mouths of the prophets that is to say in the days when the base of the house of the lord of armies has been put in place for the building of the house that is the temple
 for before those days there was no payment for a mans work or for the use of a beast and there was no peace for him who went out or him who came in because of the attacker for i had every man turned against his neighbour
 but now i will not be to the rest of this people as i was in the past says the lord of armies
 for i will let the seed of peace be planted the vine will give her fruit and the land will give her increase and the heavens will give their dew and i will give to the rest of this people all these things for their heritage
 and it will come about that as you were a curse among the nations o children of judah and children of israel so i will give you salvation and you will be a blessing have no fear and let your hands be strong
 for this is what the lord of armies has said as it was my purpose to do evil to you when your fathers made me angry says the lord of armies and my purpose was not changed
 so in these days it is again my purpose to do good to jerusalem and to the children of judah have no fear
