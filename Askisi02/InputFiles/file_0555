 and he made me go past them round about and i saw that there was a very great number of them on the face of the wide valley and they were very dry
 and he said to me son of man is it possible for these bones to come to life and i made answer and said it is for you to say o lord
 and again he said to me be a prophet to these bones and say to them o you dry bones give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said to these bones see i will make breath come into you so that you may come to life
 and i will put muscles on you and make flesh come on you and put skin over you and breath into you so that you may have life and you will be certain that i am the lord
 so i gave the word as i was ordered and at my words there was a shaking of the earth and the bones came together bone to bone
 and looking i saw that there were muscles on them and flesh came up and they were covered with skin but there was no breath in them
 and he said to me be a prophet to the wind be a prophet son of man and say to the wind the lord has said come from the four winds o wind breathing on these dead so that they may come to life
 and i gave the word at his orders and breath came into them and they came to life and got up on their feet a very great army
 then he said to me son of man these bones are all the children of israel and see they are saying our bones have become dry our hope is gone we are cut off completely
 for this cause be a prophet to them and say this is what the lord has said see i am opening the resting places of your dead and i will make you come up out of your resting places o my people and i will take you into the land of israel
 and you will be certain that i am the lord by my opening the resting places of your dead and making you come up out of your resting places o my people
 and i will put my spirit in you so that you may come to life and i will give you a rest in your land and you will be certain that i the lord have said it and have done it says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 and you son of man take one stick writing on it for judah and for the children of israel who are in his company then take another stick writing on it for joseph the stick of ephraim and all the children of israel who are in his company
 then joining them one to another make them one stick so that they may be one in your hand
 and when the children of your people say to you will you not make clear to us what these things have to do with us
 then say to them this is what the lord has said see i am taking the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel who are in his company and i will put it on the stick of judah and make them one stick and they will be one in my hand
 and the sticks with your writing on them will be in your hand before their eyes
 and say to them these are the words of the lord see i am taking the children of israel from among the nations where they have gone and will get them together on every side and take them into their land
 and i will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of israel and one king will be king over them all and they will no longer be two nations and will no longer be parted into two kingdoms
 and they will no longer make themselves unclean with their images or with their hated things or with any of their sins but i will give them salvation from all their turning away in which they have done evil and will make them clean and they will be to me a people and i will be to them a god
 and my servant david will be king over them and they will all have one keeper and they will be guided by my orders and will keep my rules and do them
 and they will be living in the land which i gave to jacob my servant in which your fathers were living and they will go on living there they and their children and their childrens children for ever and david my servant will be their ruler for ever
 and i will make an agreement of peace with them it will be an eternal agreement with them and i will have mercy on them and make their numbers great and will put my holy place among them for ever
 and my house will be over them and i will be to them a god and they will be to me a people
 and the nations will be certain that i who make israel holy am the lord when my holy place is among them for ever
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned against gog of the land of magog the ruler of rosh meshech and tubal and be a prophet against him
 and say this is what the lord has said see i am against you o gog ruler of rosh meshech and tubal
