 and david desiring directions from god said am i to go up against the philistines and will you give them into my hands and the lord said go up for i will give them into your hands
 so they went up to baal perazim and david overcame them there and david said god has let the forces fighting against me be broken by my hand as a wall is broken down by rushing water so they gave that place the name of baal perazim
 and the philistines did not take their images with them in their flight and at davids orders they were burned with fire
 then the philistines again went out in every direction in the valley
 and david went for directions to god and god said to him you are not to go up after them but turning away from them come face to face with them opposite the spice trees
 and at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go out to the fight for god has gone out before you to overcome the army of the philistines
 and david did as the lord had said and they overcame the army of the philistines attacking them from gibeon as far as gezer
 and davids name was honoured in all lands and the lord put the fear of him on all nations
 and david made houses for himself in the town of david and he got ready a place for the ark of god and put up a tent for it
 then david said the ark of god may not be moved by any but the levites for they have been marked out by god to take the ark of god and to do his work for ever
 and david made all israel come together at jerusalem to take the ark of the lord to its place which he had got ready for it
 and david got together the sons of aaron and the levites
 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brothers a hundred and twenty
 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred and twenty
 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brothers a hundred and thirty
 of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred
 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brothers eighty
 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brothers a hundred and twelve
 and david sent for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab
 and said to them you are the heads of the families of the levites make yourselves holy you and your brothers so that you may take the ark of the lord the god of israel to the place which i have made ready for it
 for because you did not take it at the first the lord our god sent punishment on us because we did not get directions from him in the right way
 so the priests and the levites made themselves holy to take up the ark of the lord the god of israel
 and the sons of the levites took up the ark of god lifting it by its rods as the lord had said to moses
 and david gave orders to the chief of the levites to put their brothers the music makers in position with instruments of music corded instruments and brass with glad voices making sounds of joy
 so heman the son of joel and of his brothers asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brothers ethan the son of kushaiah were put in position by the levites
 and with them their brothers of the second order zechariah bani and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel the door keepers
 so those who made melody heman asaph and ethan were put in position with brass instruments sounding loudly
 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with corded instruments put to alamoth
 and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel and azaziah with corded instruments on the octave to give the first note of the song
 and chenaniah chief of the levites was master of the music he gave directions about the song because he was expert
