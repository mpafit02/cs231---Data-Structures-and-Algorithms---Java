 but he said to them in answer my mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of god and do it
 now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go over to the other side of the water and they put out the boat
 but while they were sailing he went to sleep and a storm of wind came down on the sea and the boat became full of water and they were in danger
 then they came to him and awaking him out of his sleep said master master destruction is near and he when he was awake gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves and the storm came to an end and all was calm
 and he said to them where is your faith and fear and wonder overcame them and they said to one another who then is this who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says
 and they came to the country of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee
 and when he had come to the land there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits and for a long time he had had no clothing on and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead
 and when he saw jesus he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god do not be cruel to me
 for he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man for frequently it would take a grip of him and he was kept under control and prisoned with chains but parting the chains in two he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places
 and jesus said to him what is your name and he said legion for a number of spirits had gone into him
 and they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep
 now there was a great herd of pigs in that place getting food on the mountain and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs and he let them
 and the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction
 and when the men who took care of them saw what had come about they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country
 and they went out to see what had taken place and they came to jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone seated clothed and with full use of his senses at the feet of jesus and fear came on them
 and those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well
 and all the people of the country of the gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them for they were in great fear and he got into a boat and went back
 but the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him but he sent him away saying
 go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which god has done for you and he went away giving word through all the town of the great things which jesus had done for him
 and when jesus went back the people were glad to see him for they were all waiting for him
 then there came a man named jairus who was a ruler in the synagogue and he went down at the feet of jesus desiring him to come to his house
 for he had an only daughter about twelve years old and she was near to death but while he was on his way the people were pushing to be near him
 and a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and had given all her money to medical men and not one of them was able to make her well
 came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped
 and jesus said who was touching me and when they all said it is not i peter and those who were with him said master the people are pushing round you on every side
 but jesus said someone was touching me for i had the feeling that power had gone out from me
 and when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret she came shaking with fear and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him and how she was made well straight away
 and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
 while he was still talking someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue saying your daughter is dead do not go on troubling the master
 but jesus at these words said to him have no fear only have faith and she will be made well
