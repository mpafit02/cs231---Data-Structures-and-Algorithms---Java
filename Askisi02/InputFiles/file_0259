 that i am full of sorrow and pain without end
 for i have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers my family in the flesh
 who are israelites who have the place of sons and the glory and the agreements with god and the giving of the law and the worship and the hope offered by god
 whose are the fathers and of whom came christ in the flesh who is over all god to whom be blessing for ever so be it
 but it is not as if the word of god was without effect for they are not all israel who are of israel
 and they are not all children because they are the seed of abraham but in isaac will your seed be named
 that is it is not the children of the flesh but the children of gods undertaking who are named as the seed
 for this is the word of gods undertaking at this time will i come and sarah will have a son
 and not only so but rebecca being about to have a child by our father isaac  
 before the children had come into existence or had done anything good or bad in order that gods purpose and his selection might be effected not by works but by him whose purpose it is
 it was said to her the older will be the servant of the younger
 even as it is said i had love for jacob but for esau i had hate
 what may we say then is god not upright let it not be said
 for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and pity on whom i will have pity
 so then it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man but by the mercy of god
 for the holy writings say to pharaoh for this same purpose did i put you on high so that i might make my power seen in you and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth
 so then at his pleasure he has mercy on a man and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard
 but you will say to me why does he still make us responsible who is able to go against his purpose
 but o man who are you to make answer against god may the thing which is made say to him who made it why did you make me so
 or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour and out of another a vessel for shame
 what if god desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction
 and to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy which he had before made ready for glory
 even us who were marked out by him not only from the jews but from the gentiles
 as he says in hosea they will be named my people who were not my people and she will be loved who was not loved
 and in the place where it was said to them you are not my people there they will be named the sons of the living god
 and isaiah says about israel even if the number of the children of israel is as the sand of the sea only a small part will get salvation
 for the lord will give effect to his word on the earth putting an end to it and cutting it short
 and as isaiah had said before if the lord of armies had not given us a seed we would have been like sodom and gomorrah
 what then may we say that the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith
 but israel going after a law of righteousness did not get it
