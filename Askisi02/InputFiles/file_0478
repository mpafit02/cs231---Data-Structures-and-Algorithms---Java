 a young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others
 because out of a prison the young man comes to be king though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom
 i saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king
 there was no end of all the people of all those whose head he was but they who come later will have no delight in him this again is to no purpose and desire for wind
 put your feet down with care when you go to the house of god for it is better to give ear than to make the burned offerings of the foolish whose knowledge is only of doing evil
 be not unwise with your mouth and let not your heart be quick to say anything before god because god is in heaven and you are on the earth  so let not the number of your words be great
 as a dream comes from much business so the voice of a foolish man comes with words in great number
 when you take an oath before god put it quickly into effect because he has no pleasure in the foolish keep the oath you have taken
 it is better not to take an oath than to take an oath and not keep it
 let not your mouth make your flesh do evil and say not before the angel it was an error so that god may not be angry with your words and put an end to the work of your hands
 because much talk comes from dreams and things of no purpose but let the fear of god be in you
 if you see the poor under a cruel yoke and law and right being violently overturned in a country be not surprised because one authority is keeping watch on another and there are higher than they
 it is good generally for a country where the land is worked to have a king
 he who has a love for silver never has enough silver or he who has love for wealth enough profit this again is to no purpose
 when goods are increased the number of those who take of them is increased and what profit has the owner but to see them
 the sleep of a working man is sweet if he has little food or much but to him who is full sleep will not come
 there is a great evil which i have seen under the sun  wealth kept by the owner to be his downfall
 and i saw the destruction of his wealth by an evil chance and when he became the father of a son he had nothing in his hand
 as he came from his mother at birth so does he go again he gets from his work no reward which he may take away in his hand
 and this again is a great evil that in all points as he came so will he go and what profit has he in working for the wind
 all his days are in the dark and he has much sorrow pain disease and trouble
 this is what i have seen it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun all the days of his life which god has given him that is his reward
 every man to whom god has given money and wealth and the power to have pleasure in it and to do his part and have joy in his work this is given by god
 he will not give much thought to the days of his life because god lets him be taken up with the joy of his heart
 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is hard on men
 a man to whom god gives money wealth and honour so that he has all his desires but god does not give him the power to have joy of it and a strange man takes it this is to no purpose and an evil disease
 if a man has a hundred children and his life is long so that the days of his years are great in number but his soul takes no pleasure in good and he is not honoured at his death i say that a birth before its time is better than he
 in wind it came and to the dark it will go and with the dark will its name be covered
 yes it saw not the sun and it had no knowledge it is better with this than with the other
 and though he goes on living a thousand years twice over and does not see good are not the two going to the same place
