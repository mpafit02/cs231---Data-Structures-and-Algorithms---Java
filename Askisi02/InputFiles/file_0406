 and she said to him not so my brother for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before but he gave no attention to her
 then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said put this woman out and let the door be locked after her
 now she had on a long robe such as in past times the kings virgin daughters were dressed in then the servant put her out locking the door after her
 and tamar in her grief put dust on her head and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly
 and her brother absalom said to her has your brother amnon been with you but now let there be an end to your crying my sister he is your brother do not take this thing to heart so tamar went on living uncomforted in her brothers house
 but when king david had news of all these things he was very angry but he did not make trouble for amnon his son for he was dear to david being his oldest son
 but absalom said nothing to his brother amnon good or bad for he was full of hate for him because he had taken his sister tamar by force
 now after two full years absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in baal hazor which is near ephraim and he sent for all the kings sons to come to his feast
 and absalom came to the king and said see now your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep will the king and his servants be pleased to come
 and the king said to absalom no my son let us not all go or the number will be over great for you and he made his request again but he would not go but he gave him his blessing
 then absalom said if you will not go then let my brother amnon go with us and the king said to him is there any reason for him to go with you
 but absalom went on requesting him till he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him and absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king
 now absalom had given orders to his servants saying now take note when amnons heart is glad with wine and when i say to you make an attack on amnon then put him to death without fear have i not given you orders be strong and without fear
 so absaloms servants did to amnon as absalom had given them orders then all the kings sons got up and every man got on his beast and went in flight
 now while they were on their way news was given to david that absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living
 then the king got up in great grief stretching himself out on the earth and all his servants were by his side with their clothing parted
 and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother said let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death for only amnon is dead this has been purposed by absalom from the day when he took his sister tamar by force
 so now let not my lord the king take this thing to heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead for only amnon is dead
 but absalom went in flight and the young man who kept the watch lifting up his eyes saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the horons and the watchman came and gave word to the king saying i saw men coming down by the way of the horons from the hillside
 and jonadab said to the king see the kings sons are coming as your servant said so it is
 and while he was talking the kings sons came with weeping and loud cries and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly
 so absalom went in flight and came to talmai the son of ammihud the king of geshur where he was for three years
 and the king was sorrowing for his son all the time
 and the heart of david was wasted with desire for absalom for he was comforted for the death of amnon
 now it was clear to joab the son of zeruiah that the kings heart was turning to absalom
 and joab sent to tekoa and got from there a wise woman and said to her now make yourself seem like one given up to grief and put on the clothing of sorrow not using any sweet oil for your body but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for the dead
 and come to the king and say these words to him so joab gave her words to say
 and the woman of tekoa came to the king and falling on her face gave him honour and said give me help o king
 and the king said to her what is your trouble and her answer was truly i am a widow and my husband is dead
 and i had two sons and the two of them had a fight in the field and there was no one to come between them and one with a blow put the other to death
