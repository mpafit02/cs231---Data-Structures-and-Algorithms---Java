 so then king agrippa i did not go against the vision from heaven
 but i went about first to those in damascus and jerusalem and through all the country of judaea and then to the gentiles preaching a change of heart so that they being turned to god might give in their works the fruits of a changed heart
 for this reason the jews took me in the temple and made an attempt to put me to death
 and so by gods help i am here today witnessing to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would come about
 that the christ would go through pain and being the first to come back from the dead would give light to the people and to the gentiles
 and when he made his answer in these words festus said in a loud voice paul you are off your head your great learning has made you unbalanced
 then paul said i am not off my head most noble festus but my words are true and wise
 for the king has knowledge of these things to whom i am talking freely being certain that all this is common knowledge to him for it has not been done in secret
 king agrippa have you faith in the prophets i am certain that you have
 and agrippa said to paul a little more and you will be making me a christian
 and paul said it is my prayer to god that in little or great measure not only you but all those hearing me today might be even as i am but for these chains
 and the king and the ruler and bernice and those who were seated with them got up
 and when they had gone away they said to one another this man has done nothing which might give cause for death or prison
 and agrippa said to festus this man might have been made free if he had not put his cause before caesar
 and when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to italy they gave paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named julius of the augustan band
 and we went to sea in a ship of adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of asia aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us
 and on the day after we came to sidon and julius was kind to paul and let him go to see his friends and take a rest
 and sailing again from there we went on under cover of cyprus because the wind was against us
 and having gone across the sea off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia
 and there the captain came across a ship of alexandria sailing for italy and put us in it
 and when we had gone on slowly for a long time and had had hard work getting across to cnidus for the wind was against us we went under cover of crete in the direction of salmone
 and sailing down the side of it as well as we were able we came to a certain place named fair havens near which was the town of lasea
 and as a long time had gone by and the journey was now full of danger because it was late in the year paul put the position before them
 saying friends i see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss not only to the goods and the ship but to ourselves
 but the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what paul said
 and as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter the greater number of them were for going out to sea in order if possible to put in for the winter at phoenix a harbour of crete looking to the north east and south east
 and when the south wind came softly being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of crete very near to the land
 but after a little time a very violent wind named euraquilo came down from it with great force
 and when the ship got into the grip of it and was not able to make headway into the wind we gave way and went before it
 and sailing near the side of a small island named cauda we were able though it was hard work to make the ships boat safe
