 by me the great teeth of the evil doer were broken and i made him give up what he had violently taken away
 then i said i will come to my end with my children round me my days will be as the sand in number
 my root will be open to the waters and the night mist will be on my branches
 my glory will be ever new and my bow will be readily bent in my hand
 men gave ear to me waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions
 after i had said what was in my mind they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts
 they were waiting for me as for the rain opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains
 i was laughing at them when they had no hope and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear
 i took my place as a chief guiding them on their way and i was as a king among his army 
 then opening his mouth and cursing the day of his birth
 job made answer and said
 let destruction take the day of my birth and the night on which it was said a man child has come into the world
 that day  let it be dark let not god take note of it from on high and let not the light be shining on it
 let the dark and the black night take it for themselves let it be covered with a cloud let the dark shades of day send fear on it
 that night  let the thick dark take it let it not have joy among the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months
 as for that night let it have no fruit let no voice of joy be sounded in it
 let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day who are ready to make leviathan awake
 let its morning stars be dark let it be looking for light but may it not have any let it not see the eyes of the dawn
 because it did not keep the doors of my mothers body shut so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes
 why did death not take me when i came out of my mothers body why did i not when i came out give up my last breath
 why did the knees take me or why the breasts that they might give me milk
 for then i might have gone to my rest in quiet and in sleep have been in peace
 with kings and the wise ones of the earth who put up great houses for themselves
 or with rulers who had gold and whose houses were full of silver
 or as a child dead at birth i might never have come into existence like young children who have not seen the light
 there the passions of the evil are over and those whose strength has come to an end have rest
 there the prisoners are at peace together the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears
 the small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master
 why does he give light to him who is in trouble and life to the bitter in soul
 to those whose desire is for death but it comes not who are searching for it more than for secret wealth
