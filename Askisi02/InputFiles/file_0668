 for you had faith in your evil doing you said no one sees me by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way and you have said in your heart i am and there is no other
 because of this evil will come on you which may not be turned away for any price and trouble will overtake you from which no money will give salvation destruction will come on you suddenly without your knowledge
 go on now with your secret arts and all your wonder working to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days it may be that they will be of profit to you or by them you may put fear into your attackers
 but your mind is troubled by the number of your guides let them now come forward for your salvation the measurers of the heavens the watchers of the stars and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you
 truly they have become like dry stems they have been burned in the fire they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame it is not a coal for warming them or a fire by which a man may be seated
 small profit have you had from those who from your earliest days got great profit out of you they have gone in flight every one straight before him and you have no saviour
 give ear to this o family of jacob you who are named by the name of israel and have come out of the body of judah who take oaths by the name of the lord and make use of the name of the god of israel but not truly and not in good faith
 for they say that they are of the holy town and put their faith in the god of israel the lord of armies is his name
 i gave word in the past of the things which came about they came from my mouth and i made them clear suddenly i did them and they came about
 because i saw that your heart was hard and that your neck was an iron cord and your brow brass
 for this reason i made it clear to you in the past before it came i gave you word of it for fear that you might say my god did these things and my pictured and metal images made them come about
 all this has come to your ears and you have seen it will you not give witness to it i am now making clear new things even secret things of which you had no knowledge
 they have only now been effected and not in the past and before this day they had not come to your ears for fear that you might say i had knowledge of them
 truly you had no word of them no knowledge of them no news of them in the past had come to your ears because i saw how false was your behaviour and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days
 because of my name i will put away my wrath and for my praise i will keep myself from cutting you off
 see i have been testing you for myself like silver i have put you through the fire of trouble
 for myself even because of my name i will do it for i will not let my name be shamed and my glory i will not give to another
 give ear to me jacob and israel my loved one i am he i am the first and i am the last
 yes by my hand was the earth placed on its base and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out at my word they take up their places
 come together all of you and give ear who among you has given news of these things the lords loved one will do his pleasure with babylon and with the seed of the chaldaeans
 i even i have given the word i have sent for him i have made him come and have given effect to his undertakings
 come near to me and give ear to this from the start i did not keep it secret from the time of its coming into existence i was there and now the lord god has sent me and given me his spirit
 the lord who takes up your cause the holy one of israel says i am the lord your god who is teaching you for your profit guiding you by the way in which you are to go
 if only you had given ear to my orders then your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea
 your seed would have been like the sand and your offspring like the dust your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me
 go out of babylon go in flight from the chaldaeans with the sound of song make it clear give the news let the word go out even to the end of the earth say the lord has taken up the cause of his servant jacob
 they had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands he made water come out of the rock for them the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out
 there is no peace says the lord for the evil doers
 give ear o sea lands to me and take note you peoples from far i have been marked out by the lord from the first when i was still in my mothers body he had my name in mind
 and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shade of his hand he has kept me and he has made me like a polished arrow keeping me in his secret place
