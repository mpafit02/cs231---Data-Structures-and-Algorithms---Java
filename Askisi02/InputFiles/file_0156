 now the feast of unleavened bread was near which is called the passover
 and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death but they went in fear of the people
 and satan came into judas iscariot who was one of the twelve
 and he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers about how he might give him up to them
 and they were glad and undertook to give him money
 and he made an agreement with them to give him up to them if he got a chance when the people were not present
 and the day of unleavened bread came when the passover lamb is put to death
 and jesus sent peter and john saying go and make the passover ready for us so that we may take it
 and they said to him where are we to get it ready
 and he said to them when you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water go after him into the house into which he goes
 and say to the master of the house the master says where is the guest room where i may take the passover with my disciples
 and he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats there make ready
 and they went and it was as he had said and they made the passover ready
 and when the time had come he took his seat and the apostles with him
 and he said i have had a great desire to keep this passover with you before i come to my death
 for i say to you i will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of god
 and he took a cup and having given praise he said make division of this among yourselves
 for i say to you i will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of god has come
 and he took bread and having given praise he gave it to them when it had been broken saying this is my body which is given for you do this in memory of me
 and in the same way after the meal he took the cup saying this cup is the new testament made with my blood which is given for you
 but the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table
 for it will be done to the son of man after the purpose of god but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up
 and they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing
 and there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest
 and he said the kings of the gentiles are lords over them and those who have authority are given names of honour
 but let it not be so with you but he who is greater let him become like the younger and he who is chief like a servant
 for which is greater the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him is it not the guest but i am among you as a servant
 but you are those who have kept with me through my troubles
 and i will give you a kingdom as my father has given one to me
 so that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom and be seated like kings judging the twelve tribes of israel
