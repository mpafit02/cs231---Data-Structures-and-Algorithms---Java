 the lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven to whom be glory for ever and ever so be it
 give my love to prisca and aquila and those of the house of onesiphorus
 erastus was stopping at corinth but trophimus when i last saw him was at miletus ill
 do your best to come before the winter eubulus sends you his love and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brothers
 the lord be with your spirit grace be with you
 i have given an earlier account o theophilus of all the things which jesus did and of his teaching from the first
 till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders through the holy spirit to the apostles of whom he had made selection
 and to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living after his death for he was seen by them for forty days and gave them teaching about the kingdom of god
 and when they were all together with him he gave them orders not to go away from jerusalem but to keep there waiting till the word of the father was put into effect of which he said i have given you knowledge
 for the baptism of john was with water but you will have baptism with the holy spirit after a little time
 so when they were together they said to him lord will you at this time give back the kingdom to israel
 and he said to them it is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the father has kept in his control
 but you will have power when the holy spirit has come on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and all judaea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
 and when he had said these things while they were looking he was taken up and went from their view into a cloud
 and while they were looking up to heaven with great attention two men came to them in white clothing
 and said o men of galilee why are you looking up into heaven this jesus who was taken from you into heaven will come again in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
 then they went back to jerusalem from the mountain named olivet which is near jerusalem a sabbath days journey away
 and when they came in they went up into the room where they were living peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas the son of james
 and they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer with the women and mary the mother of jesus and his brothers
 and in those days peter got up among the brothers  there were about one hundred and twenty of them  and said
 my brothers the word of god had to be put into effect which the holy spirit had said before by the mouth of david about judas who was guide to those who took jesus
 for he was numbered among us and had his part in our work
  now this man with the reward of his evil doing got for himself a field and falling head first came to a sudden and violent end there
 and this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in jerusalem so that the field was named in their language akel dama or the field of blood 
 for in the book of psalms it says let his house be waste and let no man be living in it and let his position be taken by another
 for this reason of the men who have been with us all the time while the lord jesus went in and out among us
 starting from the baptism of john till he went up from us one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death
 and they made selection of two joseph named barsabbas whose other name was justus and matthias
 and they made prayers and said lord having knowledge of the hearts of all men make clear which of these two has been marked out by you
 to take that position as a servant and apostle from which judas by his sin was shut out so that he might go to his place
