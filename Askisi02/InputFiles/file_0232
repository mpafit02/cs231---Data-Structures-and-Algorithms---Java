 but without your approval i would do nothing so that your good works might not be forced but done freely from your heart
 for it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time so that you might have him for ever
 no longer as a servant but more than a servant a brother very dear to me specially but much more to you in the flesh as well as in the lord
 if then you take me to be your friend and brother take him in as myself
 if he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything put it to my account
 i paul writing this myself say i will make payment to you and i do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life
 so brother let me have joy of you in the lord give new life to my heart in christ
 being certain that you will do my desire i am writing to you in the knowledge that you will do even more than i say
 and make a room ready for me for i am hoping that through your prayers i will be given to you

 and from jesus christ the true witness the first to come back from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth to him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood
 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his god and father to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever so be it

 i am the first and the last says the lord god who is and was and is to come the ruler of all
 i john your brother who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of jesus was in the island which is named patmos for the word of god and the witness of jesus
 i was in the spirit on the lords day and a great voice at my back as of a horn came to my ears
 saying what you see put in a book and send it to the seven churches to ephesus and to smyrna and to pergamos and to thyatira and to sardis and to philadelphia and to laodicea
 and turning to see the voice which said these words to me i saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them
 and in the middle of them one like a son of man clothed with a robe down to his feet and with a band of gold round his breasts
 and his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire
 and his feet like polished brass as if it had been burned in a fire and his voice was as the sound of great waters
 and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp two edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in its strength
 and when i saw him i went down on my face at his feet as one dead and he put his right hand on me saying have no fear i am the first and the last and the living one
 and i was dead and see i am living for ever and i have the keys of death and of hell
