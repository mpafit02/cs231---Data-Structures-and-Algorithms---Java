 so that on the gentiles might come the blessing of abraham in christ jesus in order that we through faith might have the spirit which god had undertaken to give
 brothers as men would say even a mans agreement when it has been made certain may not be put on one side or have additions made to it
 now to abraham were the undertakings given and to his seed he says not and to seeds as of a great number but as of one he says and to your seed which is christ
 now this i say the law which came four hundred and thirty years after does not put an end to the agreement made before by god so as to make the undertaking without effect
 because if the heritage is by the law it is no longer dependent on the word of god but god gave it to abraham by his word
 what then is the law it was an addition made because of sin till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go between
 now a go between is not a go between of one but god is one
 is the law then against the words of god in no way because if there had been a law which was able to give life truly righteousness would have been by the law
 however the holy writings have put all things under sin so that that for which god gave the undertaking based on faith in jesus christ might be given to those who have such faith
 but before faith came we were kept in prison under the law waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come
 so the law has been a servant to take us to christ so that we might have righteousness by faith
 but now that faith is come we are no longer under a servant
 because you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus
 for all those of you who were given baptism into christ did put on christ
 there is no jew or greek servant or free male or female because you are all one in jesus christ
 and if you are christs then you are abrahams seed and yours is the heritage by the right of gods undertaking given to abraham
 but i say that as long as the son is a child he is in no way different from a servant though he is lord of all
 but is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father
 so we when we were young were kept under the first rules of the world
 but when the time had come god sent out his son made of a woman made under the law
 that he might make them free who were under the law and that we might be given the place of sons
 and because you are sons god has sent out the spirit of his son into our hearts saying abba father
 so that you are no longer a servant but a son and if a son then the heritage of god is yours
 but at that time having no knowledge of god you were servants to those who by right are no gods
 but now that you have come to have knowledge of god or more truly god has knowledge of you how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things desiring to be servants to them again
 you keep days and months and fixed times and years
 i am in fear of you that i may have been working for you to no purpose
 my desire for you brothers is that you may be as i am because i am as you are you have done me no wrong
 but you have knowledge that with a feeble body i was preaching the good news to you the first time
 and you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh or put shame on it but you took me to your hearts as an angel of god even as christ jesus
