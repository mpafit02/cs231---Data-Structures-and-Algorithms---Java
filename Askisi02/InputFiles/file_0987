 &ltto the chief music maker maschil of the sons of korah&gt like the desire of the roe for the water streams so is my souls desire for you o god
 my soul is dry for need of god the living god when may i come and see the face of god
 my tears have been my food day and night while they keep saying to me where is your god
 let my soul be overflowing with grief when these things come back to my mind how i went in company to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with the song of those who were keeping the feast
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 my soul is crushed down in me so i will keep you in mind from the land of jordan and of the hermons from the hill mizar
 deep is sounding to deep at the noise of your waterfalls all your waves have gone rolling over me
 but the lord will send his mercy in the daytime and in the night his song will be with me a prayer to the god of my life
 i will say to god my rock why have you let me go from your memory why do i go in sorrow because of the attacks of my haters
 the cruel words of my haters are like a crushing of my bones when they say to me every day where is your god
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 be my judge o god supporting my cause against a nation without religion o keep me from the false and evil man
 you are the god of my strength why have you put me from you why do i go in sorrow because of the attacks of my haters
 o send out your light and your true word let them be my guide let them take me to your holy hill and to your tents
 then i will go up to the altar of god to the god of my joy i will be glad and give praise to you on an instrument of music o god my god
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 &ltto the chief music maker of the sons of korah maschil&gt it has come to our ears o god our fathers have given us the story of the works which you did in their days in the old times
 uprooting the nations with your hand and planting our fathers in their place cutting down the nations but increasing the growth of your people
 for they did not make the land theirs by their swords and it was not their arms which kept them safe but your right hand and your arm and the light of your face because you had pleasure in them
 you are my king and my god ordering salvation for jacob
 through you will we overcome our haters by your name will they be crushed under our feet who are violent against us
 i will not put faith in my bow my sword will not be my salvation
 but it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us and have put to shame those who had hate for us
 our pride is in god at all times to his name we give praise for ever  selah 
 but now you have sent us away from you and put us to shame you do not go out with our armies
 because of this we are turned back by the attacker those who have hate for us take our goods for themselves
 you have made us like sheep which are taken for meat we are put to flight among the nations
 you let your people go for nothing your wealth is not increased by their price
 you have made us to be looked down on by our neighbours we are laughed at and shamed by those who are round about us
 our name is a word of shame among the nations a sign for the shaking of heads among the peoples
