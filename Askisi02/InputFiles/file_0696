 from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even till this day for twenty three years the word of the lord has been coming to me and i have given it to you getting up early and talking to you but you have not given ear
 and the lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you have not given attention and your ear has not been open to give hearing
 saying come back now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and keep your place in the land which the lord has given to you and to your fathers from times long past even for ever
 do not go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship and do not make me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
 but you have not given ear to me says the lord so that you have made me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
 so this is what the lord of armies has said because you have not given ear to my words
 see i will send and take all the families of the north says the lord and nebuchadrezzar king of babylon my servant and make them come against this land and against its people and against all these nations on every side and i will give them up to complete destruction and make them a cause of fear and surprise and a waste place for ever
 and more than this i will take from them the sound of laughing voices the voice of joy the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride the sound of the stones crushing the grain and the shining of lights
 all this land will be a waste and a cause of wonder and these nations will be the servants of the king of babylon for seventy years
 and it will come about after seventy years are ended that i will send punishment on the king of babylon and on that nation says the lord for their evil doing and on the land of the chaldaeans and i will make it a waste for ever
 and i will make that land undergo everything i have said against it even everything recorded in this book which jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations
 for a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them even of them and i will give them the reward of their acts even the reward of the work of their hands
 for this is what the lord the god of israel has said to me take the cup of the wine of this wrath from my hand and make all the nations to whom i send you take of it
 and after drinking it they will go rolling from side to side and be off their heads because of the sword which i will send among them
 then i took the cup from the lords hand and gave a drink from it to all the nations to whom the lord sent me
 jerusalem and the towns of judah and their kings and their princes to make them a waste place a cause of fear and surprise and a curse as it is this day
 pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people
 and all the mixed people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and gaza and ekron and the rest of ashdod
 edom and moab and the children of ammon
 and all the kings of tyre and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the lands across the sea
 dedan and tema and buz and all who have the ends of their hair cut
 and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mixed people living in the waste land
 and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes
 and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
 and you are to say to them this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said take of this cup and be overcome and let it come out again from your lips and from your fall you will never be lifted up again because of the sword which i will send among you
 and it will be if they will not take of the cup in your hand then you are to say to them this is what the lord of armies has said you will certainly take of it
 for see i am starting to send evil on the town which is named by my name and are you to be without any punishment you will not be without punishment for i will send a sword on all people living on the earth says the lord of armies
 so as a prophet give out these words among them and say to them the voice of the lord will be sounding like a lion from on high he will send out his voice from his holy place like the loud voice of a lion against his flock he will give a cry like those who are crushing the grapes against all the people of the earth
 a noise will come even to the end of the earth for the lord has a cause against the nations he will give his decision against all flesh as for the evil doers he will give them to the sword says the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said see evil is going out from nation to nation and a great storm will come up from the inmost parts of the earth
