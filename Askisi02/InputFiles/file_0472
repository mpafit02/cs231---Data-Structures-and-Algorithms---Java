 have no fear of them but keep well in mind what the lord your god did to pharaoh and to all egypt
 the great punishments which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the strong hand and the stretched out arm by which the lord your god took you out so will the lord your god do to all the peoples who are the cause of your fears
 and the lord will send a hornet among them till all the rest who have kept themselves safe from you in secret places have been cut off
 have no fear of them for the lord your god is with you a great god greatly to be feared
 the lord your god will send out the nations before you little by little they are not to be rooted out quickly for fear that the beasts of the field may be increased overmuch against you
 but the lord your god will give them up into your hands overpowering them till their destruction is complete
 he will give their kings into your hands and you will put their names out of existence under heaven there is not one of them who will not give way before you till their destruction is complete
 the images of their gods are to be burned with fire have no desire for the gold and silver on them and do not take it for yourselves for it will be a danger to you it is a thing disgusting to the lord your god
 and you may not take a disgusting thing into your house and so become cursed with its curse but keep yourselves from it turning from it with fear and hate for it is a cursed thing
 take care to keep all the orders which i give you today so that you may have life and be increased and go in and take as a heritage the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers undertook to give you
 and keep in mind the way by which the lord your god has taken you through the waste land these forty years so that he might make low your pride and put you to the test to see what was in your heart and if you would keep his orders or not
 and he made low your pride and let you be without food and gave you manna for your food a thing new to you which your fathers never saw so that he might make it clear to you that bread is not mans only need but his life is in every word which comes out of the mouth of the lord
 through all these forty years your clothing did not get old or your feet become tired
 keep in mind this thought that as a son is trained by his father so you have been trained by the lord your god
 then keep the orders of the lord your god fearing him and walking in his ways
 for the lord your god is guiding you into a good land a land of water springs of fountains and deep streams flowing out from the valleys and the hills
 a land of grain and vines and fig trees and fair fruits a land of oil giving olive trees and honey
 where there will be bread for you in full measure and you will be in need of nothing a land where the very stones are iron and from whose hills you may get copper
 and you will have food enough and be full praising the lord your god for the good land he has given you
 then take care that you are not turned away from the lord your god and from keeping his orders and decisions and laws which i give you this day
 and when you have taken food and are full and have made fair houses for yourselves and are living in them
 and when your herds and your flocks are increased and your stores of silver and gold and you have wealth of every sort
 take care that your hearts are not lifted up in pride giving no thought to the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 who was your guide through that great and cruel waste where there were poison snakes and scorpions and a dry land without water who made water come out of the hard rock for you
 who gave you manna for your food in the waste land a food which your fathers had never seen so that your pride might be broken and your hearts tested for your good in the end
 say not then in your hearts my power and the strength of my hands have got me this wealth
 but keep in mind the lord your god for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth so that he may give effect to the agreement which he made by his oath with your fathers as at this day
 and it is certain that if at any time you are turned away from the lord your god and go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship destruction will overtake you
 like the nations which the lord is cutting off before you so you will be cut off because you would not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 give ear o israel today you are to go over jordan to take the heritage of nations greater and stronger than yourselves and towns of great size with walls as high as heaven
