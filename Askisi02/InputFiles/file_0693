 and after that says the lord i will give up zedekiah king of judah and his servants and his people even those in the town who have not come to their end from the disease and the sword and from need of food into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those desiring their death he will put them to the sword he will not let anyone get away he will have no pity or mercy
 and to this people you are to say the lord has said see i put before you the way of life and the way of death
 he who keeps in this town will come to his death by the sword and through need of food and through disease but he who goes out and gives himself up to the chaldaeans who are shutting you in will go on living and will keep his life safe
 for my face is turned to this town for evil and not for good says the lord it will be given into the hands of the king of babylon and he will have it burned with fire
 about the family of the king of judah give ear to the word of the lord
 o family of david this is what the lord has said do what is right in the morning and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away or my wrath will go out like fire burning so that no one may put it out because of the evil of your doings
 see i am against you you who are living on the rock of the valley says the lord you who say who will come down against us or who will get into our houses
 i will send punishment on you in keeping with the fruit of your doings says the lord and i will put a fire in her woodlands burning up everything round about her
 this is what the lord has said go down to the house of the king of judah and there give him this word
 and say give ear to the word of the lord o king of judah seated on the seat of david you and your servants and your people who come in by these doors
 this is what the lord has said do what is right judging uprightly and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away do no wrong and be not violent to the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow and let not those who have done no wrong be put to death in this place
 for if you truly do this then there will come in through the doors of this house kings seated on the seat of david going in carriages and on horseback he and his servants and his people
 but if you do not give ear to these words i give you my oath by myself says the lord that this house will become a waste
 for this is what the lord has said about the family of the king of judah you are gilead to me and the top of lebanon but truly i will make you waste with towns unpeopled
 and i will make ready those who will send destruction on you everyone armed for war by them your best cedar trees will be cut down and put in the fire
 and nations from all sides will go past this town and every man will say to his neighbour why has the lord done such things to this great town
 and they will say because they gave up the agreement of the lord their god and became worshippers and servants of other gods
 let there be no weeping for the dead and make no songs of grief for him but make bitter weeping for him who has gone away for he will never come back or see again the country of his birth
 for this is what the lord has said about shallum the son of josiah king of judah who became king in place of josiah his father who went out from this place he will never come back there again
 but death will come to him in the place where they have taken him away prisoner and he will never see this land again
 a curse is on him who is building his house by wrongdoing and his rooms by doing what is not right who makes use of his neighbour without payment and gives him nothing for his work
 who says i will make a wide house for myself and rooms of great size and has windows cut out and has it roofed with cedar and painted with bright red
 are you to be a king because you make more use of cedar than your father did not your father take food and drink and do right judging in righteousness and then it was well for him
 he was judge in the cause of the poor and those in need then it was well was not this to have knowledge of me says the lord
 but your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself on causing the death of him who has done no wrong and on violent and cruel acts
 so this is what the lord has said about jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they will make no weeping for him saying ah my brother  or ah sister  they will make no weeping for him saying ah lord  or ah his glory 
 they will do to him what they do to the dead body of an ass his body will be pulled out and placed on the earth outside the doors of jerusalem
 go up to lebanon and give a cry let your voice be loud in bashan crying out from abarim for all your lovers have come to destruction
 my word came to you in the time of your well being but you said i will not give ear this has been your way from your earliest years you did not give attention to my voice
 all the keepers of your sheep will be food for the wind and your lovers will be taken away prisoners truly then you will be shamed and unhonoured because of all your evil doing
