 for what profit will a man have if he gets all the world but undergoes loss or destruction himself
 for if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words the son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels
 but truly i say to you some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
 and about eight days after he had said these things he took peter and john and james with him and went up into the mountain for prayer
 and while he was in prayer his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining
 and two men moses and elijah were talking with him
 who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in jerusalem
 now peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were with him
 and when they were about to go away from him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three tents one for you and one for moses and one for elijah having no knowledge of what he was saying
 and while he said these things the shade of a cloud came over them and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud
 and there was a voice from the cloud saying this is my son the man of my selection give ear to him
 and after the voice was gone they saw that jesus was by himself and they kept quiet and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen
 and on the day after when they came down from the mountain a great band of people came to him
 and a man from among them crying out said master i make a request to you give a thought to my son for he is my only child
 and see a spirit takes him and suddenly he gives a cry twisted in pain and streaming at the lips and when it goes away from him at last he is marked as from blows
 and i made a request to your disciples to send it out of him but they were not able to do it
 and jesus said o generation without faith and false in heart how long will i have to be with you and put up with you let your son come here
 and while he was coming he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit but jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit and made the boy well and gave him back to his father
 and they were full of wonder at the great power of god but while they were all wondering at all the things which he did he said to his disciples
 let these words go deep into your ears for the son of man will be given up into the hands of men
 but this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it and they had fear of questioning him about it
 now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest
 but when jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts he took a small child and put him by his side
 and said to them whoever gives honour to this child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me for whoever is least among you all that man is great
 and john answering said master we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name and we did not let him do it because he was not one of us
 but jesus said to him let him do it for he who is not against you is for you
 and it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up his face was turned to go to jerusalem
 and he sent men before and they came to a small town of samaria to make ready for him
 but they would not have him there because he was clearly going to jerusalem
 and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them
