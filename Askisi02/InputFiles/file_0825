 say to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel this is the order which the lord has given
 if any man of israel puts to death an ox or a lamb or a goat in or outside the tent circle
 and has not taken it to the door of the tent of meeting to make an offering to the lord before the lords house its blood will be on him for he has taken life and he will be cut off from among his people
 so that the children of israel may take to the lord to the door of the tent of meeting and to the priest the offerings which they have put to death in the open country and that they may make their peace offerings to the lord
 and the priest will put blood on the altar of the lord at the door of the tent of meeting burning the fat for a sweet smell to the lord
 and let them make no more offerings to evil spirits after which they have gone turning away from the lord let this be a law to them for ever through all their generations
 and say to them if any man of israel or any other living among them makes a burned offering or other offering
 and does not take it to the door of the tent of meeting to make an offering to the lord that man will be cut off from among his people
 and if any man of israel or any other living among them takes any sort of blood for food my wrath will be turned against that man and he will be cut off from among his people
 for the life of the flesh is in its blood and i have given it to you on the altar to take away your sin for it is the blood which makes free from sin because of the life in it
 for this reason i have said to the children of israel no man among you or any others living with you may take blood as food
 and any man of israel or any other living among them who gets with his bow any beast or bird used for food is to see that its blood is covered with earth
 for the blood is the life of all flesh and so i have said to the children of israel you may not take any sort of blood as food and any man who does so will be cut of
 and anyone who takes as food anything which has come to a natural end or anything which has been put to death by beasts if he is one of you by birth or of another nation will have to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening and then he will be clean
 but if his clothing is not washed and his body bathed his sin will be on him
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel i am the lord your god
 you may not do those things which were done in the land of egypt where you were living and you may not do those things which are done in the land of canaan where i am taking you or be guided in your behaviour by their rules
 but you are to be guided by my decisions and keep my rules and be guided by them i am the lord your god
 so keep my rules and my decisions which if a man does them will be life to him i am the lord
