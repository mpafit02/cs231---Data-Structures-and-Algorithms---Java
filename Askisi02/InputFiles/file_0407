 and now all the family is turned against me your servant saying give up him who was the cause of his brothers death so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother whose life he took and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage so they will put out my last burning coal and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth
 and the king said to the woman go to your house and i will give orders about this
 and the woman of tekoa said to the king my lord o king may the sin be on me and on my family and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin 
 and the king said if anyone says anything to you make him come to me and he will do you no more damage
 then she said let the king keep in mind the lord your god so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son and he said by the living lord not a hair of your sons head will come to the earth
 then the woman said will the king let his servant say one word more and he said say on
 and the woman said why have you had such a thought about the people of god  for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away 
 for death comes to us all and we are like water drained out on the earth which it is not possible to take up again and god will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him
 and now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king and your servant said i will put my cause before the king and it may be that he will give effect to my request
 for the king will give ear and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of god
 then your servant said may the word of my lord the king give me peace  for my lord the king is as the angel of god in his hearing of good and bad and may the lord your god be with you 
 then the king said to the woman now give me an answer to the question i am going to put to you keep nothing back and the woman said let my lord the king say on
 and the king said is not the hand of joab with you in all this and the woman in answer said by the life of your soul my lord the king it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king your servant joab gave me orders and put all these words in my mouth
 this he did hoping that the face of this business might be changed and my lord is wise with the wisdom of the angel of god having knowledge of everything on earth
 and the king said to joab see now i will do this thing go then and come back with the young man absalom
 then joab falling down on his face on the earth gave the king honour and blessing and joab said today it is clear to your servant that i have grace in your eyes my lord king because the king has given effect to the request of his servant
 so joab got up and went to geshur and came back again to jerusalem with absalom
 and the king said let him go to his house but let him not see my face so absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king
 now in all israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as absalom from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful
 and when he had his hair cut  which he did at the end of every year because of the weight of his hair  the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the kings weight
 and absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named tamar who was very beautiful
 for two full years absalom was living in jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king
 then absalom sent for joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come
 so he said to his servants see joabs field is near mine and he has barley in it go and put it on fire and absaloms servants put the field on fire
 then joab came to absalom in his house and said to him why have your servants put my field on fire
 and absaloms answer was see i sent to you saying come here so that i may send you to the king to say why have i come back from geshur it would be better for me to be there still let me now see the kings face and if there is any sin in me let him put me to death
 so joab went to the king and said these words to him and when the king had sent for him absalom came and went down on his face on the earth before the king and the king gave him a kiss
 now after this absalom got for himself a carriage and horses and fifty runners to go before him
 and absalom got up early morning after morning and took his place at the side of the public meeting place and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged then absalom crying out to him said what is your town and he would say your servant is of one of the tribes of israel
 and absalom would say to him see your cause is true and right but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing
