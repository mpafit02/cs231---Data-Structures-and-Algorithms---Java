 giving to the needs of the saints ready to take people into your houses
 give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you
 take part in the joy of those who are glad and in the grief of those who are sorrowing
 be in harmony with one another do not have a high opinion of yourselves but be in agreement with common people do not give yourselves an air of wisdom
 do not give evil for evil to any man let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men
 as far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men
 do not give punishment for wrongs done to you dear brothers but give way to the wrath of god for it is said in the holy writings punishment is mine i will give reward says the lord
 but if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink give it to him for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head
 do not let evil overcome you but overcome evil by good
 let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers because there is no power which is not of god and all powers are ordered by god
 for which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of god and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves
 for rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil if you would have no fear of the authority do good and you will have praise
 for he is the servant of god to you for good but if you do evil have fear for the sword is not in his hand for nothing he is gods servant making gods punishment come on the evil doer
 so put yourselves under the authority not for fear of wrath but because you have the knowledge of what is right
 for the same reason make payment of taxes because the authority is gods servant to take care of such things at all times
 give to all what is their right taxes to him whose they are payment to him whose right it is fear to whom fear honour to whom honour is to be given
 be in debt for nothing but to have love for one another for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law
 and this do not be untrue in married life do not put to death do not take what is anothers do not have desire for what is anothers and if there is any other order it is covered by this word have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 love does no wrong to his neighbour so love makes the law complete
 see then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith
 the night is far gone and the day is near so let us put off the works of the dark arming ourselves with light
 with right behaviour as in the day not in pleasure making and drinking not in bad company and unclean behaviour not in fighting and envy
 but put on the lord jesus christ and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires
 do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings
 one man has faith to take all things as food another who is feeble in faith takes only green food
 let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does for he has gods approval
 who are you to make yourself a judge of another mans servant it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad yes his place will be safe because the lord is able to keep him from falling
 this man puts one day before another to that man they are the same let every man be certain in his mind
 he who keeps the day keeps it to the lord and he who takes food takes it as to the lord for he gives praise to god and he who does not take food to the lord he takes it not and gives praise to god
 for every mans life and every mans death has a relation to others as well as to himself
