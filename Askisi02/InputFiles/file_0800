 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he said because this nation has not been true to my agreement which i made with their fathers and has not given ear to my voice
 from now on i will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of joshua were still living in this land
 in order to put israel to the test and see if they will keep the way of the lord walking in it as their fathers did or not
 so the lord let those nations go on living in the land not driving them out quickly and did not give them up into the hands of joshua
 then all the children of israel took up arms and the people came together like one man from dan to beer sheba and the land of gilead before the lord at mizpah
 and the chiefs of the people out of all the tribes of israel took their places in the meeting of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen armed with swords
  now the children of benjamin had word that the children of israel had gone up to mizpah  and the children of israel said make clear how this evil thing took place
 then the levite the husband of the dead woman said in answer i came to gibeah in the land of benjamin i and my servant wife for the purpose of stopping there for the night
 and the townsmen of gibeah came together against me going round the house on all sides by night it was their purpose to put me to death and my servant wife was violently used by them and is dead
 so i took her cutting her into parts which i sent through all the country of the heritage of israel for they have done an act of shame in israel
 here you all are you children of israel give now your suggestions about what is to be done
 then all the people got up as one man and said not one of us will go to his tent or go back to his house
 but this is what we will do to gibeah we will go up against it by the decision of the lord
 and we will take ten men out of every hundred through all the tribes of israel a hundred out of every thousand a thousand out of every ten thousand to get food for the people so that they may give to gibeah of benjamin the right punishment for the act of shame they have done in israel
 so all the men of israel were banded together against the town united like one man
 and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what is this evil which has been done among you
 now give up those good for nothing persons in gibeah so that we may put them to death clearing away the evil from israel but the children of benjamin would not give ear to the voice of their brothers the children of israel
 and the children of benjamin came together from all their towns to gibeah to go to war with the children of israel
 and the children of benjamin who came that day from the towns were twenty six thousand men armed with swords in addition to the people of gibeah numbering seven hundred of the best fighting men
 who were left handed able to send a stone at a hair without error
 and the men of israel other than benjamin were four hundred thousand in number all armed with swords they were all men of war
 and they got up and went up to beth el to get directions from god and the children of israel said who is to be the first to go up to the fight against the children of benjamin and the lord said judah is to go up first
 so the children of israel got up in the morning and put themselves in position against gibeah
 and the men of israel went out to war against benjamin  and the men of israel put their forces in fighting order against them at gibeah 
 then the children of benjamin came out from gibeah cutting down twenty two thousand of the israelites that day
 but the people the men of israel taking heart again put their forces in order and took up the same position as on the first day
 now the children of israel went up weeping before the lord till evening requesting the lord and saying am i to go forward again to the fight against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him
 so the children of israel went forward against the children of benjamin the second day
 and the second day benjamin went out against them from gibeah cutting down eighteen thousand men of the children of israel all swordsmen
 then all the children of israel and all the people went up to beth el weeping and waiting there before the lord going without food all day till evening and offering burned offerings and peace offerings before the lord
