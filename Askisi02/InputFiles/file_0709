 now it came to the ears of ebed melech the ethiopian an unsexed servant in the kings house that they had put jeremiah into the water hole the king at that time being seated in the doorway of benjamin
 and ebed melech went out from the kings house and said to the king
 my lord the king these men have done evil in all they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have put into the water hole and he will come to his death in the place where he is through need of food for there is no more bread in the town
 then the king gave orders to ebed melech the ethiopian saying take with you three men from here and get jeremiah out of the water hole before death overtakes him
 so ebed melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king to the place where the clothing was kept and got from there old clothing and bits of old cloth and let them down by cords into the water hole where jeremiah was
 and ebed melech the ethiopian said to jeremiah put these bits of old cloth under your arms under the cords and jeremiah did so
 so pulling jeremiah up with the cords they got him out of the water hole and jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
 then king zedekiah sent for jeremiah the prophet and took him into the rulers doorway in the house of the lord and the king said to jeremiah i have a question to put to you keep nothing back from me
 then jeremiah said to zedekiah if i give you the answer to your question will you not certainly put me to death and if i make a suggestion to you you will not give it a hearing
 so king zedekiah gave his oath to jeremiah secretly saying by the living lord who gave us our life i will not put you to death or give you up to these men who are desiring to take your life
 then jeremiah said to zedekiah these are the words of the lord the god of armies the god of israel if you go out to the king of babylons captains then you will have life and the town will not be burned with fire and you and your family will be kept from death
 but if you do not go out to the king of babylons captains then this town will be given into the hands of the chaldaeans and they will put it on fire and you will not get away from them
 and king zedekiah said to jeremiah i am troubled on account of the jews who have gone over to the chaldaeans for fear that they may give me up to them and they will put me to shame
 but jeremiah said they will not give you up be guided now by the word of the lord as i have given it to you and it will be well for you and you will keep your life
 but if you do not go out this is what the lord has made clear to me
 see all the rest of the women in the house of the king of judah will be taken out to the king of babylons captains and these women will say your nearest friends have been false to you and have got the better of you they have made your feet go deep into the wet earth and they are turned away back from you
 and they will take all your wives and your children out to the chaldaeans and you will not get away out of their hands but will be taken by the hands of the king of babylon and this town will be burned with fire
 then zedekiah said to jeremiah let no man have knowledge of these words and you will not be put to death
 but if it comes to the ears of the rulers that i have been talking with you and they come and say to you give us word now of what you have said to the king and what the king said to you keeping nothing back and we will not put you to death
 then you are to say to them i made my request to the king that he would not send me back to my death in jonathans house
 then all the rulers came to jeremiah questioning him and he gave them an answer in the words the king had given him orders to say so they said nothing more to him for the thing was not made public
 so jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen till the day when jerusalem was taken
 and it came about that when jerusalem was taken  in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month nebuchadrezzar king of babylon with all his army came against jerusalem shutting it in on every side
 in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the town was broken into 
 all the captains of the king of babylon came in and took their places in the middle doorway of the town nergal shar ezer ruler of sin magir the rabmag and nebushazban the rab saris and all the captains of the king of babylon
 and when zedekiah king of judah and all the men of war saw it they went in flight from the town by night by the way of the kings garden through the doorway between the two walls and they went out by the arabah
 but the chaldaean army went after them and overtook zedekiah in the lowlands of jericho and they made him a prisoner and took him up to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath to be judged by him
 then the king of babylon put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes in riblah and the king of babylon put to death all the great men of judah
 and more than this he put out zedekiahs eyes and had him put in chains to take him away to babylon
 and the chaldaeans put the kings house on fire as well as the houses of the people and had the walls of jerusalem broken down
