 you will make me greater than before and give me comfort on every side
 i will give praise to you with instruments of music o my god for you are true i will make songs to you with music o holy one of israel
 joy will be on my lips when i make melody to you and in my soul to which you have given salvation
 my tongue will be talking of your righteousness all the day for those whose purpose is to do me evil have been crushed and put to shame
 &ltof solomon&gt give the king your authority o god and your righteousness to the kings son
 may he be a judge of your people in righteousness and make true decisions for the poor
 may the mountains give peace to the people and the hills righteousness
 may he be a judge of the poor among the people may he give salvation to the children of those who are in need by him let the violent be crushed
 may his life go on as long as the sun and moon through all generations
 may he come down like rain on the cut grass like showers watering the earth
 in his days may the upright do well living in peace as long as there is a moon in heaven
 let his kingdom be from sea to sea from the river to the ends of the earth
 let those who are against him go down before him and let his haters be low in the dust
 let the kings of tarshish and of the islands come back with offerings let the kings of sheba and seba give of their stores
 yes let all kings go down before him let all nations be his servants
 for he will be a saviour to the poor in answer to his cry and to him who is in need without a helper
 he will have pity on the poor and be the saviour of those who are in need
 he will keep their souls free from evil designs and violent attacks and their blood will be of value in his eyes
 may he have long life and may gold from sheba be given to him may prayers be made for him at all times may blessings be on him every day
 may there be wide stretching fields of grain in the land shaking on the top of the mountains full of fruit like lebanon may its stems be unnumbered like the grass of the earth
 may his name go on for ever as long as the sun may men be blessing themselves by him may all nations be blessing his name
 praise be to the lord god the god of israel the only doer of wonders
 praise to the glory of his noble name for ever let all the earth be full of his glory so be it so be it
 the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended &lta psalm of asaph&gt
 truly god is good to israel even to such as are clean in heart
 but as for me my feet had almost gone from under me i was near to slipping
 because of my envy of the men of pride when i saw the well being of the wrongdoers
 for they have no pain their bodies are fat and strong
 they are not in trouble as others are they have no part in the unhappy fate of men
 for this reason pride is round them like a chain they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe
