 then nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away to babylon as prisoners all the rest of the workmen who were still in the town as well as those who had given themselves up to him and all the rest of the people
 but nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men let the poorest of the people who had nothing whatever go on living in the land of judah and gave them vine gardens and fields at the same time
 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave orders about jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men saying
 take him and keep an eye on him and see that no evil comes to him but do with him whatever he says to you
 so nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men sent nebushazban the rab saris and nergal shar ezer the rabmag and all the chief captains of the king of babylon
 and they sent and took jeremiah out of the place of the watchmen and gave him into the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan to take him to his house so he was living among the people
 now the word of the lord came to jeremiah while he was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
 go and say to ebed melech the ethiopian this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see my words will come true for this town for evil and not for good they will come about before your eyes on that day
 but i will keep you safe on that day says the lord you will not be given into the hands of the men you are fearing
 for i will certainly let you go free and you will not be put to the sword but your life will be given to you out of the hands of your attackers because you have put your faith in me says the lord
 if you will come back o israel says the lord you will come back to me and if you will put away your disgusting ways you will not be sent away from before me
 and you will take your oath by the living lord in good faith and wisdom and righteousness and the nations will make use of you as a blessing and in you will they take a pride
 for this is what the lord says to the men of judah and to jerusalem get your unworked land ploughed up do not put in your seeds among thorns
 undergo a circumcision of the heart you men of judah and people of jerusalem or my wrath may come out like fire burning so that no one is able to put it out because of the evil of your doings
 say openly in judah give it out in jerusalem and say let the horn be sounded in the land crying out in a loud voice come together and let us go into the walled towns
 put up a flag for a sign to zion go in flight so that you may be safe waiting no longer for i will send evil from the north and a great destruction
 a lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods and one who makes waste the nations is on his way he has gone out from his place to make your land unpeopled so that your towns will be made waste with no man living in them
 for this put on haircloth with weeping and loud crying for the burning wrath of the lord is not turned back from us
 and it will come about in that day says the lord that the heart of the king will be dead in him and the hearts of the rulers and the priests will be overcome with fear and the prophets with wonder
 then said i ah lord god  your words were not true when you said to this people and to jerusalem you will have peace when the sword has come even to the soul
 at that time it will be said to this people and to jerusalem a burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people not for separating or cleaning the grain
 a full wind will come for me and now i will give my decision against them
 see he will come up like the clouds and his war carriages like the storm wind his horses are quicker than eagles sorrow is ours for destruction has come on us
 o jerusalem make your heart clean from evil so that you may have salvation how long are evil purposes to have a resting place in you
 for a voice is sounding from dan giving out evil from the hills of ephraim
 make this come to the minds of the nations make a statement openly against jerusalem that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of judah
 like keepers of a field they are against her on every side because she has been fighting against me says the lord
 your ways and your doings have made these things come on you this is your sin truly it is bitter going deep into your heart
 my soul my soul  i am pained to my inmost heart my heart is troubled in me i am not able to be quiet because the sound of the horn the note of war has come to my ears
 news is given of destruction on destruction all the land is made waste suddenly my tents straight away my curtains are made waste
