 so he gave the silver back to his mother then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them and it was in the house of micah
 and the man micah had a house of gods and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest
 in those days there was no king in israel every man did as seemed right to him
 now there was a young man living in beth lehem judah of the family of judah and a levite who was not a townsman of the place
 and he went away from the town of beth lehem judah looking for somewhere to make his living place and on his journey he came to the hill country of ephraim to the house of micah
 and micah said to him where do you come from and he said to him i am a levite from beth lehem judah and i am looking for a living place
 then micah said to him make your living place with me and be a father and a priest to me and i will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food
 and the levite said he would make his living place with the man and he became to him as one of his sons
 and micah gave the position to the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah
 then micah said now i am certain that the lord will do me good seeing that the levite has become my priest
 in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the danites were looking for a heritage for themselves to be their living place for up to that time no distribution of land had been made to them among the tribes of israel
 so the children of dan sent five men from among their number strong men from zorah and from eshtaol to take a look at the land and make a search through it and they said to them go and make a search through the land and they came to the hill country of ephraim to the house of micah where they made a stop for the night
 when they were near the house of micah hearing a voice which was not strange to them that of the young levite they went out of their road to his place and said to him how did you come here and what are you doing in this place and why are you here
 and he said to them this is what micah did for me and he gave me payment and i became his priest
 then they said do get directions from god for us to see if the journey on which we are going will have a good outcome
 and the priest said to them go in peace your way is guided by the lord
 then the five men went on their way and came to laish and saw the people who were there living without thought of danger like the zidonians quiet and safe for they had everything on earth for their needs and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with aram
 so they came back to their brothers in zorah and eshtaol and their brothers said to them what news have you
 and they said up  and let us go against laish for we have seen the land and it is very good why are you doing nothing do not be slow to go in and take the land for your heritage
 when you come there you will come to a people living without thought of danger and the land is wide and god has given it into your hands a place where there is everything on earth for mans needs
 so six hundred men of the danites from zorah and eshtaol went out armed with instruments of war
 and they went up and put up their tents in kiriath jearim in judah so that place is named mahaneh dan to this day it is to the west of kiriath jearim
 from there they went on to the hill country of ephraim and came to the house of micah
 then the five men who had gone to make a search through the country of laish said to their brothers have you knowledge that in these houses there is an ephod and family gods and a pictured image and a metal image so now you see what to do
 and turning from their road they came to the house of the young levite the house of micah and said to him is it well with you
 and the six hundred armed men of the danites took their places by the doorway
 then the five men who had gone to make a search through the land went in and took the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image and the priest was by the doorway with the six hundred armed men
 and when they went into micahs house and took out the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image the priest said to them what are you doing
 and they said to him be quiet say nothing and come with us and be our father and priest is it better for you to be priest to one mans house or to be priest to a tribe and a family in israel
 then the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the family gods and the pictured image and went with the people
