 and they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now
 but this i will say openly to you that i do give worship to the god of our fathers after that way which to them is not the true religion but i have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets
 hoping in god for that which they themselves are looking for that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers
 and in this i do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before god or men
 now after a number of years i came to give help and offerings to my nation
 and having been made clean i was in the temple but not with a great number of people and not with noise but there were certain jews from asia
 and it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement if they have anything against me
 or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when i was before the sanhedrin
 but only this one thing which i said among them in a loud voice i am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead
 but felix who had a more detailed knowledge of the way put them off saying when lysias the chief captain comes down i will give attention to your business
 and he gave orders to the captain to keep paul under his control and to let him have everything he had need of and not to keep his friends from coming to see him
 but after some days felix came with drusilla his wife who was of the jews by birth and sent for paul and gave hearing to him about faith in christ jesus
 and while he was talking about righteousness and self control and the judging which was to come felix had great fear and said go away for the present and when the right time comes i will send for you
 for he was hoping that paul would give him money so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him
 but after two years porcius festus took the place of felix who desiring to have the approval of the jews kept paul in chains
 so festus having come into that part of the country which was under his rule after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea
 and the chief priests and the chief men of the jews made statements against paul
 requesting festus to give effect to their design against him and send him to jerusalem when they would be waiting to put him to death on the way
 but festus in answer said that paul was being kept in prison at caesarea and that in a short time he himself was going there
 so he said let those who have authority among you go with me and if there is any wrong in the man let them make a statement against him
 and when he had been with them not more than eight or ten days he went down to caesarea and on the day after he took his place on the judges seat and sent for paul
 and when he came the jews who had come down from jerusalem came round him and made all sorts of serious statements against him which were not supported by the facts
 then paul in his answer to them said i have done no wrong against the law of the jews or against the temple or against caesar
 but festus desiring to get the approval of the jews said to paul will you go up to jerusalem and be judged before me there in connection with these things
 and paul said i am before the seat of caesars authority where it is right for me to be judged i have done no wrong to the jews as you are well able to see
 if then i am a wrongdoer and there is a cause of death in me i am ready for death if it is not as they say against me no man may give me up to them let my cause come before caesar
 then festus having had a discussion with the jews made answer you have said let my cause come before caesar to caesar you will go
 now when some days had gone by king agrippa and bernice came to caesarea and went to see festus
 and as they were there for some days festus gave them pauls story saying there is a certain man here who was put in prison by felix
 against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the jews made a statement when i was at jerusalem requesting me to give a decision against him
