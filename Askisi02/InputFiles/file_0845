 and you will be certain that i have sent this order to you so that it might be my agreement with levi says the lord of armies
 my agreement with him was on my side life and peace and i gave them to him on his side fear and he had fear of me and gave honour to my name
 true teaching was in his mouth and no evil was seen on his lips he was walking with me in peace and righteousness turning numbers of people away from evil doing
 for it is right for the priests lips to keep knowledge and for men to be waiting for the law from his mouth for he is the servant sent from the lord of armies
 but you are turned out of the way you have made the law hard for numbers of people you have made the agreement of levi of no value says the lord of armies
 and so i have taken away your honour and made you low before all the people even as you have not kept my ways and have given no thought to me in using the law
 have we not all one father has not one god made us why are we every one of us acting falsely to his brother putting shame on the agreement of our fathers
 judah has been acting falsely and a disgusting thing has been done in jerusalem for judah has made unclean the holy place of the lord which is dear to him and has taken as his wife the daughter of a strange god
 the lord will have the man who does this cut off root and branch out of the tents of jacob and him who makes an offering to the lord of armies
 and this again you do covering the altar of the lord with weeping and with grief so that he gives no more thought to the offering and does not take it with pleasure from your hand
 but you say for what reason because the lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your early years to whom you have been untrue though she is your friend and the wife to whom you have given your word
  so give thought to your spirit and let no one be false to the wife of his early years
 for i am against the putting away of a wife says the lord the god of israel and against him who is clothed with violent acts says the lord of armies so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts
 you have made the lord tired with your words and still you say how have we made him tired by your saying everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of the lord and he has delight in them or where is god the judge
 see i am sending my servant and he will make ready the way before me and the lord whom you are looking for will suddenly come to his temple and the angel of the agreement in whom you have delight see he is coming says the lord of armies
 but by whom may the day of his coming be faced and who may keep his place when he is seen for he is like the metal testers fire and the cleaners soap
 he will take his seat testing and cleaning the sons of levi burning away the evil from them as from gold and silver so that they may make offerings to the lord in righteousness
 then the offering of judah and jerusalem will be pleasing to the lord as in days gone by and as in past years
 and i will come near to you for judging i will quickly be a witness against the wonder workers against those who have been untrue in married life against those who take false oaths against those who keep back from the servant his payment and who are hard on the widow and the child without a father who do not give his rights to the man from a strange country and have no fear of me says the lord of armies
 for i am the lord i am unchanged and so you o sons of jacob have not been cut off
 from the days of your fathers you have been turned away from my rules and have not kept them come back to me and i will come back to you says the lord of armies but you say how are we to come back
 will a man keep back from god what is right but you have kept back what is mine but you say what have we kept back from you tenths and offerings
 you are cursed with a curse for you have kept back from me what is mine even all this nation
 let your tenths come into the store house so that there may be food in my house and put me to the test by doing so says the lord of armies and see if i do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it
 and on your account i will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time says the lord of armies
 and you will be named happy by all nations for you will be a land of delight says the lord of armies
 your words have been strong against me says the lord and still you say what have we said against you
 you have said it is no use worshipping god what profit have we had from keeping his orders and going in clothing of sorrow before the lord of armies
 and now to us the men of pride seem happy yes the evil doers are doing well they put god to the test and are safe
 then those in whom was the fear of the lord had talk together and the lord gave ear and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him for those who had the fear of the lord and gave thought to his name
