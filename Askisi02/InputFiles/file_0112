 i am not talking of you all i have knowledge of my true disciples but things are as they are so that the writings may come true the foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me
 from this time forward i give you knowledge of things before they come about so that when they come about you may have belief that i am he
 truly i say to you he who takes to his heart anyone whom i send takes me to his heart and he who so takes me takes him who sent me
 when jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit and gave witness saying truly i say to you that one of you will be false to me
 then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another in doubt as to whom he had in mind
 there was at table one of his disciples the one dear to jesus resting his head on jesus breast
 making a sign to him simon peter said who is it he is talking about
 he then resting his head on jesus breast said to him lord who is it
 this was the answer jesus gave it is the one to whom i will give this bit of bread after i have put it in the vessel then he took the bit of bread put it into the vessel and gave it to judas the son of simon iscariot
 and when judas took the bread satan went into him then jesus said to him do quickly what you have to do
 now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him
 some were of the opinion that because judas kept the money bag jesus said to him get the things we have need of for the feast or that he was to give something to the poor
 so judas having taken the bit of bread straight away went out and it was night
 then when he had gone out jesus said now is glory given to the son of man and god is given glory in him
 if god is given glory in him god will give him glory in himself and will give him glory even now
 my dear children i am only to be with you a little longer then you will be looking for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you may not come
 i give you a new law have love one for another even as i have had love for you so are you to have love one for another
 by this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples if you have love one for another
 simon peter said to him lord where are you going jesus said in answer where i am going you may not come with me now but you will come later
 peter said to him why may i not come with you even now i will give up my life for you
 jesus said in answer will you give up your life for me truly i say to you before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple
 let not your heart be troubled have faith in god and have faith in me
 in my fathers house are rooms enough if it was not so would i have said that i am going to make ready a place for you
 and if i go and make ready a place for you i will come back again and will take you to be with me so that you may be where i am
 and you all have knowledge of where i am going and of the way to it
 thomas said lord we have no knowledge of where you are going how may we have knowledge of the way
 jesus said to him i am the true and living way no one comes to the father but by me
 if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my father you have knowledge of him now and have seen him
 philip said to him lord let us see the father and we have need of nothing more
 jesus said to him philip have i been with you all this time and still you have no knowledge of me he who has seen me has seen the father why do you say let us see the father
