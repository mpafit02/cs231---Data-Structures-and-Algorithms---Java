 one day the trees went out to make a king for themselves and they said to the olive tree be king over us
 but the olive tree said to them am i to give up my wealth of oil by which men give honour to god and go waving over the trees
 then the trees said to the fig tree you come and be king over us
 but the fig tree said to them am i to give up my sweet taste and my good fruit and go waving over the trees
 then the trees said to the vine you come and be king over us
 but the vine said to them am i to give up my wine which makes glad god and men to go waving over the trees
 then all the trees said to the thorn you come and be king over us
 and the thorn said to the trees if it is truly your desire to make me your king then come and put your faith in my shade and if not may fire come out of the thorn burning up the cedars of lebanon
 so now if you have done truly and uprightly in making abimelech king and if you have done well to jerubbaal and his house in reward for the work of his hands
  for my father made war for you and put his life in danger and made you free from the hands of midian
 and you have gone against my fathers family this day and have put to death his sons even seventy men on one stone and have made abimelech the son of his servant wife king over the townsmen of shechem because he is your brother 
 if then you have done what is true and upright to jerubbaal and his family this day may you have joy in abimelech and may he have joy in you
 but if not may fire come out from abimelech burning up the townsmen of shechem and beth millo and may fire come out from the townsmen of shechem and beth millo for the destruction of abimelech
 then jotham straight away went in flight to beer and was living there for fear of his brother abimelech
 so abimelech was chief over israel for three years
 and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the townsmen of shechem and the townsmen of shechem were false to abimelech
 so that punishment for the violent attack made on the seventy sons of jerubbaal and for their blood might come on abimelech their brother who put them to death and on the townsmen of shechem who gave him their help in putting his brothers to death
 and the townsmen of shechem put secret watchers on the tops of the mountains and they made attacks on all who went by on the road and took their goods and word of this came to abimelech
 then gaal the son of ebed came with his brothers and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their faith in him
 and they went out into their fields and got in the fruit of their vines and when the grapes had been crushed they made a holy feast and went into the house of their god and over their food and drink they were cursing abimelech
 and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we are to be his servants is it not right for the son of jerubbaal and zebul his captain to be servants to the men of hamor the father of shechem but why are we to be his servants
 if only i had authority over this people  i would put abimelech out of the way and i would say to abimelech make your army strong and come out
 now zebul the ruler of the town hearing what gaal the son of ebed had said was moved to wrath
 and he sent to abimelech at arumah saying see gaal the son of ebed and his brothers have come to shechem and they are working up the town against you
 so now get up by night you and your people and keep watch in the field secretly
 and in the morning when the sun is up get up early and make a rush on the town and when he and his people come out against you do to them whatever you have a chance to do
 so abimelech and the people with him got up by night in four bands to make a surprise attack on shechem
 and gaal the son of ebed went out and took his place at the doorway into the town then abimelech and his people got up from the place where they had been waiting
 and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul see  people are coming down from the tops of the mountains and zebul said to him you see the shade of the mountains like men
 and gaal said again see  people are coming down from the middle of the land and one band is coming by way of the oak tree of the seers
