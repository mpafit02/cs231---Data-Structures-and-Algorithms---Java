 i will give the lord great praise with my mouth yes i will give praise to him among all the people
 for he is ever at the right hand of the poor to take him out of the hands of those who go after his soul
 &ltfor the chief music maker of david&gt in the lord put i my faith how will you say to my soul go in flight like a bird to the mountain
 see the bows of the evil doers are bent they make ready their arrows on the cord so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart
 if the bases are broken down what is the upright man to do
 the lord is in his holy temple the lords seat is in heaven his eyes are watching and testing the children of men
 the lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts
 on the evil doer he will send down fire and flames and a burning wind with these will their cup be full
 for the lord is upright he is a lover of righteousness the upright will see his face
 &lta psalm of david&gt the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 the lord will send out the rod of your strength from zion be king over your haters
 your people give themselves gladly in the day of your power like the dew of the morning on the holy mountains is the army of your young men
 the lord has made an oath and will not take it back you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 in the day of his wrath kings will be wounded by the lord at your right hand
 he will be judge among the nations the valleys will be full of dead bodies the head over a great country will be wounded by him
 he will take of the stream by the way so his head will be lifted up
 let the lord be praised i will give praise to the lord with all my heart among the upright and in the meeting of the people
 the works of the lord are great searched out by all those who have delight in them
 his work is full of honour and glory and his righteousness is unchanging for ever
 certain for ever is the memory of his wonders the lord is full of pity and mercy
 he has given food to his worshippers he will keep his agreement in mind for ever
 he has made clear to his people the power of his works giving them the heritage of the nations
 the works of his hands are faith and righteousness all his laws are unchanging
 they are fixed for ever and ever they are done in faith and righteousness
 he has sent salvation to his people he has given his word for ever holy is his name and greatly to be feared
 the fear of the lord is the best part of wisdom all those who keep his laws are wise his praise is eternal
 let the lord be praised happy is the man who gives honour to the lord and has great delight in his laws
 his seed will be strong on the earth blessings will be on the generation of the upright
 a store of wealth will be in his house and his righteousness will be for ever
 for the upright there is a light shining in the dark he is full of grace and pity
