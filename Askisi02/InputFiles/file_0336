 see the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your fathers people will be cut off
 and never again will there be an old man in your family
 but one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand and his eyes will be made dark and grief will be in his heart and all the offspring of your family will come to their end by the sword of men
 and this will be the sign to you which will come on hophni and phinehas your sons death will overtake them on the same day
 and i will make a true priest for myself one who will do what is in my heart and in my mind and i will make for him a family which will not come to an end and his place will be before my holy one for ever
 then it will be that the rest of your family anyone who has not been cut off will go down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread and say be pleased to put me into one of the priests places so that i may have a little food
 and david went in flight from naioth in ramah and came to jonathan and said what have i done what is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life
 and he said to him far be the thought you will not be put to death see my father does nothing great or small without giving me word of it would he keep this secret from me it is not so
 but david took his oath again and said your father sees that i am dear to you so he says to himself let jonathan have no idea of this for it will be a grief to him but as the lord is living and as your soul is living there is only a step between me and death
 then jonathan said to david whatever your desire is i will do it for you
 and david said to jonathan tomorrow is the new moon and i will not be seated with the king at his table but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening
 and if your father takes note of the fact that i am away say david made a request to me for himself that he might go to beth lehem to his town for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year
 if he says it is well your servant will be at peace but if he is angry then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me
 so then be kind to your servant for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the lord but if there is any wrongdoing in me put me to death yourself why take me to your father
 and jonathan said do not have such a thought for if i saw that my father was designing evil against you would i not give you word of it
 then david said to jonathan who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer
 and jonathan said to david come let us go out into the country and the two of them went out together into the open country
 and jonathan said to david may the lord the god of israel be witness when i have had a chance of talking to my father about this time tomorrow if his feelings to david are good will i not send and give you the news
 may the lords punishment be on jonathan if it is my fathers pleasure to do you evil and i do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace and may the lord be with you as he has been with my father
 and may you while i am still living o may you be kind to me as the lord is kind and keep me from death 
 and let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family even when the lord has sent destruction on all davids haters cutting them off from the face of the earth
 and if it comes about that the name of jonathan is cut off from the family of david the lord will make david responsible
 and jonathan again took an oath to david because of his love for him for david was as dear to him as his very soul
 then jonathan said to him tomorrow is the new moon and it will be seen that you are not present for there will be no one in your seat
 and on the third day it will be specially noted and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand waiting by the hill over there
 and on the third day i will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark
 and i will send my boy to have a look for the arrow and if i say to him see the arrow is on this side of you take it up  then you may come for there is peace for you and no evil by the living lord
 but if i say to the boy see the arrow has gone past you then go on your way for the lord has sent you away
 as for what you and i were talking of the lord is between you and me for ever
 so david went to a secret place in the country and when the new moon came the king took his place at the feast
