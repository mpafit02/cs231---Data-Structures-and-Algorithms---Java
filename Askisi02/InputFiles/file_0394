 and they put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes and then they put out his eyes and chaining him with iron bands took him to babylon
 now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month in the nineteenth year of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men a servant of the king of babylon came to jerusalem
 and he had the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burned with fire
 and the walls round jerusalem were broken down by the chaldaean army which was with the captain
 and the rest of the people who were still in the town and all those who had given themselves up to the king of babylon and all the rest of the workmen nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away as prisoners
 but he let the poorest of the land go on living there to take care of the vines and the fields
 and the brass pillars in the house of the lord and the wheeled bases and the great brass water vessel in the house of the lord were broken up by the chaldaeans who took the brass to babylon
 and the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons and all the brass vessels used in the lords house they took away
 and the fire trays and the basins the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels were all taken away by the captain of the armed men
 the two pillars the great water vessel and the wheeled bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
 one of the pillars was eighteen cubits high with a crown of brass on it the crown was three cubits high circled with a network and apples all of brass and the second pillar had the same
 and the captain of the armed men took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three door keepers
 and from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war and five of the kings near friends who were in the town and the scribe of the captain of the army who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town
 these nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took with him to the king of babylon at riblah
 and the king of babylon put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was taken away prisoner from his land
 as for the people who were still living in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon did not take away he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler over them
 now the captains of the armed forces hearing that the king of babylon had made gedaliah ruler came with their men to gedaliah at mizpah ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite came with all their men
 then gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men saying have no fear because of the servants of the chaldaeans go on living in the land under the rule of the king of babylon and all will be well
 but in the seventh month ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the kings seed came with ten men and made an attack on gedaliah causing his death and the death of the jews and the chaldaeans who were with him at mizpah
 then all the people small and great and the captains of the forces got up and went away to egypt for fear of the chaldaeans
 and in the thirty seventh year after jehoiachin king of judah had been taken prisoner in the twelfth month on the twenty seventh day of the month evil merodach king of babylon in the first year of his rule took jehoiachin king of judah out of prison
 and said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in babylon
 and his prison clothing was changed and he was a guest at the kings table every day for the rest of his life
 and for his food the king gave him a regular amount every day for the rest of his life
 and jehoram the son of ahab became king over israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of jehoshaphat king of judah and he was king for twelve years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord but not like his father and his mother for he put away the stone pillar of baal which his father had made
 but still he did the same sins which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do he went on in them
 now mesha king of moab was a sheep farmer and he gave regularly to the king of israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep
 but when ahab was dead the king of moab got free from the authority of the king of israel
 at that time king jehoram went out from samaria and got all israel together in fighting order
