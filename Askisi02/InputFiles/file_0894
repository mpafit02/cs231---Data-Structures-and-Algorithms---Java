 and moses said to the children of gad and the children of reuben are your brothers to go to the war while you take your rest here
 why would you take from the children of israel the desire to go over into the land which the lord has given them
 so did your fathers when i sent them from kadesh barnea to see the land
 for when they went up to the valley of eshcol and saw the land they took from the children of israel the desire to go into the land which the lord had given them
 and at that time the lord was moved to wrath and made an oath saying
 truly not one of the men of twenty years old and over who came out of egypt will see the land which i gave by oath to abraham isaac and jacob because they have not been true to me with all their heart
 but only caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have been true to the lord
 then the lord was angry with israel and he made them wanderers in the waste land for forty years till all that generation who had done evil in the eyes of the lord was dead
 and now you have come to take the place of your fathers another generation of sinners increasing the wrath of the lord against israel
 for if you are turned away from him he will send them wandering again in the waste land and you will be the cause of the destruction of all this people
 then they came to him and said we will make safe places for our cattle here and towns for our little ones
 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of israel till we have taken them to their place but our little ones will be safe in the walled towns against the people of the land
 we will not come back to our houses till every one of the children of israel has come into his heritage
 for we will not have our heritage with them on the other side of jordan and forward because our heritage has come to us on this side of jordan to the east
 then moses said to them if you will do this arming yourselves to go before the lord to the war
 every armed man of you going across jordan before the lord till he has overcome and sent in flight all who are against him
 and the land is under the rule of the lord then after that you may come back having done no wrong to the lord and to israel and this land will be yours for your heritage before the lord
 but if you do not do this then you are sinners against the lord and you may be certain that your sin will have its reward
 so get to work building your towns for your little ones and safe places for your sheep and do as you have said
 and the children of gad and the children of reuben said to moses your servants will do as my lord says
 our little ones our wives and our flocks and all our cattle will be there in the towns of gilead
 but your servants will go over every man armed for war before the lord to the fight as my lord says
 so moses gave orders about them to eleazar the priest and to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of families of the tribes of the children of israel
 and moses said to them if the children of gad and the children of reuben go with you over jordan every man armed for the fight before the lord and all the land is given into your hands then let them have the land of gilead for a heritage
 but if they do not go over with you armed they will have to take their heritage with you in the land of canaan
 then the children of gad and the children of reuben said as the lord has said to your servants so will we do
 we will go over armed before the lord into the land of canaan and you will give us our heritage on this side of jordan
 so moses gave to them even to the children of gad and the children of reuben and to the half tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan all the land with its towns and the country round them
 and the children of gad were the builders of dibon and ataroth and aroer
 and atroth shophan and jazer and jogbehah
