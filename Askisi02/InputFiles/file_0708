 for this reason the lord has said of jehoiakim king of judah he will have no son to take his place on the seat of david his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night
 and i will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil doing i will send on them and on the people of jerusalem and the men of judah all the evil which i said against them but they did not give ear
 then jeremiah took another book and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who put down in it from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by jehoiakim king of judah and in addition a number of other words of the same sort
 and zedekiah the son of josiah became king in place of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah
 but he and his servants and the people of the land did not give ear to the words of the lord which he said by jeremiah the prophet
 and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying make prayer now to the lord our god for us
  now jeremiah was going about among the people for they had not put him in prison
 and pharaohs army had come out from egypt and the chaldaeans who were attacking jerusalem hearing news of them went away from jerusalem 
 then the word of the lord came to the prophet jeremiah saying
 the lord the god of israel has said this is what you are to say to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from me see pharaohs army which has come out to your help will go back to egypt to their land
 and the chaldaeans will come back again and make war against this town and they will take it and put it on fire
 the lord has said have no false hopes saying to yourselves the chaldaeans will go away from us for they will not go away
 for even if you had overcome all the army of the chaldaeans fighting against you and there were only wounded men among them still they would get up every man in his tent and put this town on fire
 and it came about that when the chaldaean army outside jerusalem had gone away for fear of pharaohs army
 jeremiah went out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin with the purpose of taking up his heritage there among the people
 but when he was at the benjamin door a captain of the watch named irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah who was stationed there put his hand on jeremiah the prophet saying you are going to give yourself up to the chaldaeans
 then jeremiah said that is not true i am not going to the chaldaeans but he would not give ear to him so irijah made him prisoner and took him to the rulers
 and the rulers were angry with jeremiah and gave him blows and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison
 so jeremiah came into the hole of the prison under the arches and was there for a long time
 then king zedekiah sent and got him out and the king questioning him secretly in his house said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is then he said you will be given up into the hands of the king of babylon
 then jeremiah said to king zedekiah what has been my sin against you or against your servants or against this people that you have put me in prison
 where now are your prophets who said to you the king of babylon will not come against you and against this land
 and now be pleased to give ear o my lord the king let my prayer for help come before you and do not make me go back to the house of jonathan the scribe for fear that i may come to my death there
 then by the order of zedekiah the king jeremiah was put into the place of the armed watchmen and they gave him every day a cake of bread from the street of the bread makers till all the bread in the town was used up so jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
 now it came to the ears of shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashhur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashhur the son of malchiah that jeremiah had said to all the people
 these are the words of the lord whoever goes on living in this town will come to his death by the sword or through need of food or by disease but whoever goes out to the chaldaeans will keep his life out of the power of the attackers and be safe
 the lord has said this town will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of babylon and he will take it
 then the rulers said to the king let this man be put to death because he is putting fear into the hearts of the men of war who are still in the town and into the hearts of the people by saying such things to them this man is not working for the well being of the people but for their damage
 then zedekiah the king said see he is in your hands for the king was not able to do anything against them
 so they took jeremiah and put him into the water hole of malchiah the kings son in the place of the armed watchmen and they let jeremiah down with cords and in the hole there was no water but wet earth and jeremiah went down into the wet earth
