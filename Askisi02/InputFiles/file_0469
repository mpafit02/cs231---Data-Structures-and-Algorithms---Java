 all this he let you see so that you might be certain that the lord is god and there is no other
 out of heaven itself his voice came to you teaching you and on earth he let you see his great fire and his words came to your ears out of the heart of the fire
 and because of his love for your fathers he took their seed and made it his and he himself present among you took you out of egypt by his great power
 driving out before you nations greater and stronger than you to take you into their land and give it to you for your heritage as at this day
 so today be certain and keep the knowledge deep in your hearts that the lord is god in heaven on high and here on earth there is no other god
 then keep his laws and his orders which i give you today so that it may be well for you and for your children after you and that your lives may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you for ever
 then moses had three towns marked out on the far side of jordan looking to the east
 to which anyone causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate might go in flight so that in one of these towns he might be kept from death
 the names of the towns were bezer in the waste land in the table land for the reubenites and ramoth in gilead for the gadites and golan in bashan for manasseh
 this is the law which moses put before the children of israel
 these are the rules and the laws and the decisions which moses gave to the children of israel after they came out of egypt
 on the far side of jordan in the valley facing beth peor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon whom moses and the children of israel overcame after they had come out of egypt
 and they took his land for a heritage and the land of og king of bashan the two kings of the amorites whose lands were on the other side of jordan to the east
 from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon as far as mount sion which is hermon
 and all the arabah on the far side of jordan to the east as far as the sea of the arabah under the slopes of pisgah
 and moses sent for all israel and said to them give ear o israel to the laws and the decisions which i give you today and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them
 the lord our god made an agreement with us in horeb
 the lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us who are all living and present here today
 the word of the lord came to you face to face on the mountain out of the heart of the fire
  i was between the lord and you at that time to make clear to you the word of the lord because through fear of the fire you did not go up the mountain  saying
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 you are to have no other gods but me
 you may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth
 you may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for i the lord your god am a god who will not give his honour to another and i will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
 and i will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
 you are not to make use of the name of the lord your god for an evil purpose whoever takes the lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the lord
 keep the sabbath day as a holy day as you have been ordered by the lord your god
 on six days do all your work
 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on that day do no work you or your son or your daughter or your man servant or your woman servant or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you so that your man servant and your woman servant may have rest as well as you
 and keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord your god took you out of that land by his strong hand and his stretched out arm for this reason the lord has given you orders to keep the sabbath day
