 because whoever has a desire to keep his life safe will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
 for what profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life or what will a man give in exchange for his life
 for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will give to every man the reward of his works
 truly i say to you there are some of those here who will not have a taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
 and after six days jesus takes with him peter and james and john his brother and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves
 and he was changed in form before them and his face was shining like the sun and his clothing became white as light
 and moses and elijah came before their eyes talking with him
 and peter made answer and said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you will let me i will make here three tents one for you and one for moses and one for elijah
 while he was still talking a bright cloud came over them and a voice out of the cloud saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased give ear to him
 and at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear
 and jesus came and put his hand on them and said get up and have no fear
 and lifting up their eyes they saw no one but jesus only
 and when they were coming down from the mountain jesus gave them orders saying let no man have word of what you have seen till the son of man has come again from the dead
 and his disciples questioning him said why then do the scribes say that elijah has to come first
 and in answer he said elijah truly has to come and put all things right
 but i say to you that elijah has come and they had no knowledge of him but did to him whatever they were pleased to do the same will the son of man undergo at their hands
 then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of john the baptist
 and when they came to the people a man went down on his knees to him saying
 lord have mercy on my son for he is off his head and is in great pain and frequently he goes falling into the fire and frequently into the water
 and i took him to your disciples and they were not able to make him well
 and jesus answering said o false and foolish generation how long will i be with you how long will i put up with you let him come here to me
 and jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit and it went out of him and the boy was made well from that hour
 then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why were we not able to send it out
 and he says to them because of your little faith for truly i say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to this mountain be moved from this place to that and it will be moved and nothing will be impossible to you
   
 and while they were going about in galilee jesus said to them the son of man will be given up into the hands of men
 and they will put him to death and the third day he will come again from the dead and they were very sad
 and when they had come to capernaum those who took the temple tax came to peter and said does not your master make payment of the temple tax
 he says yes and when he came into the house jesus said to him what is your opinion simon from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax from their sons or from other people
 and when he said from other people jesus said to him then are the sons free
