 who are glad with great joy and full of delight when they come to their last resting place
 to a man whose way is veiled and who is shut in by god
 in place of my food i have grief and cries of sorrow come from me like water
 for i have a fear and it comes on me and my heart is greatly troubled
 i have no peace no quiet and no rest nothing but pain comes on me
 but now those who are younger than i make sport of me those whose fathers i would not have put with the dogs of my flocks
 of what use is the strength of their hands to me all force is gone from them
 they are wasted for need of food biting the dry earth their only hope of life is in the waste land
 they are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood and making a meal of roots
 they are sent out from among their townsmen men are crying after them as thieves
 they have to get a resting place in the hollows of the valleys in holes of the earth and rocks
 they make noises like asses among the brushwood they get together under the thorns
 they are sons of shame and of men without a name who have been forced out of the land
 and now i have become their song and i am a word of shame to them
 i am disgusting to them they keep away from me and put marks of shame on me
 for he has made loose the cord of my bow and put me to shame he has sent down my flag to the earth before me
 the lines of his men of war put themselves in order and make high their ways of destruction against me
 they have made waste my roads with a view to my destruction his bowmen come round about me
 as through a wide broken place in the wall they come on i am overturned by the shock of their attack
 fears have come on me my hope is gone like the wind and my well being like a cloud
 but now my soul is turned to water in me days of trouble overtake me
 the flesh is gone from my bones and they give me no rest there is no end to my pains
 with great force he takes a grip of my clothing pulling me by the neck of my coat
 truly god has made me low even to the earth and i have become like dust
 you give no answer to my cry and take no note of my prayer
 you have become cruel to me the strength of your hand is hard on me
 lifting me up you make me go on the wings of the wind i am broken up by the storm
 for i am certain that you will send me back to death and to the meeting place ordered for all living
 has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor have i not been a saviour to him in his trouble
 have i not been weeping for the crushed and was not my soul sad for him who was in need
