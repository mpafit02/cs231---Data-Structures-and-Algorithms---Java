 and the spirit gave me orders to go with them doubting nothing and these six brothers came with me and we went into that mans house
 and he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house saying send to joppa and get simon named peter to come to you
 who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation
 and while i was talking to them the holy spirit came on them as on us at first
 and the words of the lord came into my mind how he said the baptism of john was with water but you will have baptism with the holy spirit
 if then god gave them when they had faith in the lord jesus christ the same as he gave to us who was i to go against god
 and hearing these things they said nothing more but gave glory to god saying then to the gentiles as to us has god given a change of heart so that they may have life
 then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about stephen went as far as phoenicia and cyprus preaching to the jews only
 but some of them men of cyprus and cyrene when they came to antioch gave the good news about the lord jesus to the greeks
 and the power of the lord was with them and a great number had faith and were turned to the lord
 and news of them came to the ears of the church at jerusalem and they sent barnabas as far as antioch
 who when he came and saw the grace of god was glad and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the lord with all the strength of their hearts
 for he was a good man and full of the holy spirit and of faith and a great number were joined to the lord
 then he went on to tarsus looking for saul
 and when he had come across him he took him to antioch and they were with the church there for a year teaching the people and the disciples were first given the name of christians in antioch
 now in those days prophets came from jerusalem to antioch
 and one of them named agabus said publicly through the spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth which came about in the time of claudius
 and the disciples everyone as he was able made a decision to send help to the brothers living in judaea
 which they did sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of barnabas and saul
 now about that time herod the king made cruel attacks on the christians
 and he put james the brother of john to death with the sword
 and when he saw that this was pleasing to the jews he went on to take peter in addition this was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread
 and having taken him he put him in prison with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him his purpose being to take him out to the people after the passover
 so peter was kept in prison but the church made strong prayer to god for him
 and when herod was about to take him out the same night peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison
 and a great light was seen shining in the room and an angel of the lord came to peter and touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep said get up quickly and his chains came off his hands
 then the angel said put on your shoes and get ready to go and he did so and he said put your coat round you and come with me
 and he went out after him and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision
 and when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town which came open by itself and they went out and down one street and then the angel went away
 and when peter came to his senses he said now truly i am certain that the lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of herod against all the hopes of the jews
