 he sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
 he made me free from my strong hater and from those who were against me because they were stronger than i
 they came on me in the day of my trouble but the lord was my support
 he took me out into a wide place he was my saviour because he had delight in me
 the lord gives me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean before him
 for i have kept the ways of the lord i have not been turned away in sin from my god
 for all his decisions were before me and i did not put away his laws from me
 and i was upright before him and i kept myself from sin
 because of this the lord has given me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean in his eyes
 on him who has mercy you will have mercy to the upright you will be upright
 he who is holy will see that you are holy but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge
 for you are the saviour of those who are in trouble but eyes full of pride will be made low
 you o lord will be my light by you my god the dark will be made bright for me
 by your help i have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in by the help of my god i have gone over a wall
 as for god his way is completely good the word of the lord is tested he is a breastplate for all those who put their faith in him
 for who is god but the lord or who is a rock but our god
 god puts a strong band about me guiding me in a straight way
 he makes my feet like roes feet and puts me on high places
 he makes my hands expert in war so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms
 you have given me the breastplate of your salvation your right hand has been my support and your mercy has made me great
 you have made my steps wide under me so that my feet are kept from slipping
 i go after my haters and overtake them not turning back till they are all overcome
 i will give them wounds so that they are not able to get up they are stretched under my feet
 for i have been armed by you with strength for the fight you have made low under me those who come out against me
 by you their backs are turned in flight so that my haters are cut off
 they were crying out but there was no one to come to their help even to the lord but he gave them no answer
 then they were crushed as small as dust before the wind they were drained out like the waste of the streets
 you have made me free from the fightings of the people you have made me the head of the nations a people of whom i had no knowledge will be my servants
 from the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me men of other countries will with false hearts put themselves under my authority
 they will be wasting away they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear
