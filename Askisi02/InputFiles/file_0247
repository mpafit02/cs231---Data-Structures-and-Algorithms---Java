 for with the heart man has faith to get righteousness and with the mouth he says that jesus is lord to get salvation
 because it is said in the holy writings whoever has faith in him will not be shamed
 and the jew is not different from the greek for there is the same lord of all who is good to all who have hope in his name
 because whoever will give worship to the name of the lord will get salvation
 but how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news and how will they have news without a preacher
 and how will there be preachers if they are not sent as it is said how beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things
 but they have not all given ear to the good news for isaiah says lord who has had faith in our word
 so faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of christ
 but i say did not the word come to their ears yes certainly their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
 but i say had israel no knowledge first moses says you will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation and by a foolish people i will make you angry
 and isaiah says without fear those who were not searching for me made discovery of me and i was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me
 but about israel he says all the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away and who put themselves against my word
 so i say has god put his people on one side let there be no such thought for i am of israel of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
 god has not put away the people of his selection or have you no knowledge of what is said about elijah in the holy writings how he says words to god against israel
 lord they have put your prophets to death and made waste your altars and now i am the last and they are searching for me to take away my life
 but what answer does god make to him i have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to baal
 in the same way there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace
 but if it is of grace then it is no longer of works or grace would not be grace
 what then that which israel was searching for he did not get but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard
 as it was said in the holy writings god gave them a spirit of sleep eyes which might not see and ears which have no hearing to this day
 and david says let their table be made a net for taking them and a stone in their way and a punishment
 let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see and let their back be bent down at all times
 so i say were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall in no way but by their fall salvation has come to the gentiles so that they might be moved to envy
 now if their fall is the wealth of the world and their loss the wealth of the gentiles how much greater will be the glory when they are made full
 but i say to you gentiles in so far as i am the apostle of the gentiles i make much of my position
 if in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy so that some of them may get salvation by me
 for if by their putting away the rest of men have been made friends with god what will their coming back again be but life from the dead
 and if the first fruit is holy so is the mass and if the root is holy so are the branches
 but if some of the branches were broken off and you an olive tree of the fields were put in among them and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive tree is made fertile
 do not be uplifted in pride over the branches because it is not you who are the support of the root but it is by the root that you are supported
