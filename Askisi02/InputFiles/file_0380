 and he gave them orders saying this is what you are to do the third part of you who come in on the sabbath and keep the watch of the kings house
 
 and the two divisions of you who go out on the sabbath and keep the watch of the house of the lord
 will make a circle round the king every man being armed and whoever comes inside your lines is to be put to death keep with the king when he goes out and when he comes in
 and the captains of hundreds did as jehoiada the priest gave them orders every one took with him his men those who came in and those who went out on the sabbath and they came in to jehoiada the priest
 and the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body covers which had been king davids and which were kept in the house of the lord
 then the armed men took up their positions every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left round about the altar and the house
 then he made the kings son come out and put the crown on him and the arm bands and made him king and put the holy oil on him and they all making sounds of joy with their hands said long life to the king
 now athaliah hearing the noise made by the people came to the people in the house of the lord
 and looking she saw the king in his regular place by the pillar and the captains and the horns near him and all the people of the land giving signs of joy and sounding the horns then athaliah violently parting her robes gave a cry saying broken faith broken faith 
 then jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army saying take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword for he said let her not be put to death in the house of the lord
 so they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the horses and there she was put to death
 and jehoiada made an agreement between the lord and the king and the people that they would be the lords people and in the same way between the king and the people
 then all the people of the land went to the house of baal and had it pulled down its altars and images were all broken to bits and mattan the priest of baal they put to death before the altars and the priest put overseers over the lords house
 then he took the captains of hundreds and the carians and the armed men and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the lord through the doorway of the armed men to the kings house and he took his place on the seat of the kings
 so all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet and they had put athaliah to death with the sword at the kings house
 and jehoash was seven years old when he became king
 in the seventh year of jehus rule jehoash became king and he was ruling for forty years in jerusalem his mothers name was zibiah of beer sheba
 jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the lord all his days because he was guided by the teaching of jehoiada the priest
 but the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the holy things which comes into the house of the lord  the amount fixed for every mans payment  and all the money given by any man freely from the impulse of his heart
 let the priests take every man from his friends and neighbours to make good what is damaged in the house wherever it is to be seen
 but in the twenty third year of king jehoash the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the house
 then king jehoash sent for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them why have you not made good what is damaged in the house now take no more money from your neighbours but give it for the building up of the house
 so the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people and not to make good what was damaged in the house
 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and making a hole in the cover of it put it by the altar on the right side when one comes into the house of the lord and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all the money which was taken into the house of the lord
 and when they saw that there was much money in the chest the kings scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the lord
 and the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the lord
 and to the wall builders and the stone cutters and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the lord and for everything needed to put the house in good order
 but the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or wind instruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the lord
