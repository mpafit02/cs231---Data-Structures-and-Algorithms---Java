 so they said to him how then were your eyes made open
 his answer was the man who is named jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes and said to me go and make yourself clean in siloam so i went away and after washing am now able to see
 and they said to him where is he his answer was i have no knowledge
 they took him before the pharisees  this man who had been blind
 now the day on which the earth was mixed by jesus and the mans eyes were made open was the sabbath
 so the pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open and he said to them he put earth on my eyes and i had a wash and am able to see
 then some of the pharisees said that man has not come from god for he does not keep the sabbath others said how is it possible for a sinner to do such signs so there was a division among them
 again they said to the blind man what have you to say about him for opening your eyes and he said he is a prophet
 now the jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open
 and put the question to them saying is this your son of whom you say that he was blind at birth how is it then that he is now able to see
 in answer his father and mother said we are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth
 but how it is he is now able to see or who made his eyes open we are not able to say put the question to him he is old enough to give an answer for himself
 they said this because of their fear of the jews for the jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that jesus was the christ he would be put out of the synagogue
 that was the reason why they said he is old enough put the question to him
 so they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god it is clear to us that this man is a sinner
 he said in answer i have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not but one thing i am certain about i was blind and now i see
 then they said to him what did he do to you how did he give you the use of your eyes
 his answer was i have said it before but your ears were shut why would you have me say it again is it your desire to become his disciples
 and they were angry with him and said you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses
 we are certain that god gave his word to moses but as for this man we have no knowledge where he comes from
 the man said in answer why here is a strange thing  you have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes
 we have knowledge that god does not give ear to sinners but if any man is a worshipper of god and does his pleasure to him gods ears are open
 in all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open
 if this man did not come from god he would be unable to do anything
 their answer was you came to birth through sin do you make yourself our teacher and they put him out of the synagogue
 it came to the ears of jesus that they had put him out and meeting him he said have you faith in the son of man
 he said in answer and who is he lord say so that i may have faith in him
 jesus said to him you have seen him it is he who is talking to you
 and he said lord i have faith and he gave him worship
 and jesus said i came into this world to be a judge so that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind
