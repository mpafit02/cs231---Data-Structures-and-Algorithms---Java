 but if the spirit of him who made jesus come again from the dead is in you he who made christ jesus come again from the dead will in the same way through his spirit which is in you give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death
 so then my brothers we are in debt not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh
 for if you go in the way of the flesh death will come on you but if by the spirit you put to death the works of the body you will have life
 and all those who are guided by the spirit of god are sons of god
 for you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear but the spirit of sons was given to you by which we say abba father
 the spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of god
 and if we are children we have a right to a part in the heritage a part in the things of god together with christ so that if we have a part in his pain we will in the same way have a part in his glory
 i am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future
 for the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of god
 for every living thing was put under the power of change not by its desire but by him who made it so in hope
 that all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of god in glory
 for we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now
 and not only so but we who have the first fruits of the spirit even we have sorrow in our minds waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons that is the salvation of our bodies
 for our salvation is by hope but hope which is seen is not hope for who is hoping for what he sees
 but if we have hope for that which we see not then we will be able to go on waiting for it
 and in the same way the spirit is a help to our feeble hearts for we are not able to make prayer to god in the right way but the spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say
 and he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the spirit because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of god
 and we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for god and have been marked out by his purpose
 because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence were marked out by him to be made like his son so that he might be the first among a band of brothers
 and those who were marked out by him were named and those who were named were given righteousness and to those to whom he gave righteousness in the same way he gave glory
 what may we say about these things if god is for us who is against us
 he who did not keep back his only son but gave him up for us all will he not with him freely give us all things
 who will say anything against the saints of god it is god who makes us clear from evil
 who will give a decision against us it is christ jesus who not only was put to death but came again from the dead who is now at the right hand of god taking our part
 who will come between us and the love of christ will trouble or pain or cruel acts or the need of food or of clothing or danger or the sword
 as it is said in the holy writings because of you we are put to death every day we are like sheep ready for destruction
 but we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love
 for i am certain that not death or life or angels or rulers or things present or things to come or powers
 or things on high or things under the earth or anything which is made will be able to come between us and the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
 i say what is true in christ and not what is false my mind giving witness with me in the holy spirit
