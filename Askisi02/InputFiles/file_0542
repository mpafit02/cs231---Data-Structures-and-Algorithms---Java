 and they will take you in hand with hate and take away all the fruit of your work and let you be unveiled and without clothing and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered your evil designs and your loose ways
 they will do these things to you because you have been untrue to me and have gone after the nations and have become unclean with their images
 you have gone in the way of your sister and i will give her cup into your hand
 this is what the lord has said you will take a drink from your sisters cup which is deep and wide you will be laughed at and looked down on more than you are able to undergo
 you will be broken and full of sorrow with the cup of wonder and destruction with the cup of your sister samaria
 and after drinking it and draining it out you will take the last drops of it to the end pulling off your breasts for i have said it says the lord
 so this is what the lord has said because you have not kept me in your memory and because your back has been turned to me you will even undergo the punishment of your evil designs and your loose ways
 then the lord said to me son of man will you be the judge of oholibah then make clear to her the disgusting things she has done
 for she has been false to me and blood is on her hands and with her images she has been untrue and more than this she made her sons whom she had by me go through the fire to them to be burned up
 further this is what she has done to me she has made my holy place unclean and has made my sabbaths unclean
 for when she had made an offering of her children to her images she came into my holy place to make it unclean see this is what she has done inside my house
 and she even sent for men to come from far away to whom a servant was sent and they came for whom she was washing her body and painting her eyes and making herself fair with ornaments
 and she took her seat on a great bed with a table put ready before it on which she put my perfume and my oil
  and they put jewels on her hands and beautiful crowns on her head
 then i said  now she will go on with her loose ways
 and they went in to her as men go to a loose woman so they went in to oholibah the loose woman
 and upright men will be her judges judging her as false wives and women who take lives are judged because she has been untrue to me and blood is on her hands
 for this is what the lord has said i will make a great meeting of the people come together against her and will send on her shaking fear and take everything from her
 and the meeting after stoning her with stones will put an end to her with their swords they will put her sons and daughters to death and have her house burned up with fire
 and i will put an end to evil in all the land teaching all women not to do as you have done
 and i will send on you the punishment of your evil ways and you will be rewarded for your sins with your images and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month saying
 son of man put down in writing this very day the king of babylon let loose the weight of his attack against jerusalem on this very day
 and make a comparison for this uncontrolled people and say to them this is what the lord has said put on the cooking pot put it on the fire and put water in it
 and get the bits together the fat tail every good part the leg and the top part of it make it full of the best bones
 take the best of the flock put much wood under it see that its bits are boiling well let the bones be cooked inside it
 for this is what the lord has said a curse is on the town of blood the cooking pot which is unclean inside which has never been made clean  take out its bits its fate is still to come on it
 for her blood is in her she has put it on the open rock not draining it on to the earth so that it might be covered with dust
 in order that it might make wrath come up to give punishment she has put her blood on the open rock so that it may not be covered
 for this cause the lord has said a curse is on the town of blood  and i will make great the burning mass
