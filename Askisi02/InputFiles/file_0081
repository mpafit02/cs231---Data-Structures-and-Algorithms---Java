 even as he made selection of us in him from the first so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love
 as we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself through jesus christ in the good pleasure of his purpose
 to the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely gave to us in the loved one
 in whom we have salvation through his blood the forgiveness of our sins through the wealth of his grace
 which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care
 having made clear to us the secret of his purpose in agreement with the design which he had in mind to put into his hands
 the ordering of the times when they are complete so that all things might come to a head in christ the things in heaven and the things on the earth in him i say
 in whom we have a heritage being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs
 so that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in christ
 in whom you having been given the true word the good news of your salvation and through your faith in him were given the sign of the holy spirit of hope
 which is the first fruit of our heritage till god gets back that which is his to the praise of his glory
 for this cause i having had news of the faith in the lord jesus which is among you and which you make clear to all the saints
 give praise without end for you keeping you in mind in my prayers
 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
 and that having the eyes of your heart full of light you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints
 and how unlimited is his power to us who have faith as is seen in the working of the strength of his power
 by which he made christ come back from the dead and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven
 far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named not only in the present order but in that which is to come
 and he has put all things under his feet and has made him to be head over all things to the church
 which is his body the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete
 and to you did he give life when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins
 in which you were living in the past after the ways of this present world doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of god
 among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind and the punishment of god was waiting for us even as for the rest
 but god being full of mercy through the great love which he had for us
 even when we were dead through our sins gave us life together with christ  by grace you have salvation 
 so that we came back from death with him and are seated with him in the heavens in christ jesus
 that in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in christ jesus
 because by grace you have salvation through faith and that not of yourselves it is given by god
 not by works so that no man may take glory to himself
 for by his act we were given existence in christ jesus to do those good works which god before made ready for us so that we might do them
