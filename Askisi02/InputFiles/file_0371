 go and get directions from the lord for me and for those who are still in israel and for judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the lord which has been let loose on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord or done what is recorded in this book
 so hilkiah and those whom the king sent went to huldah the woman prophet the wife of shallum the son of tokhath the son of hasrah the keeper of the robes  now she was living in jerusalem in the second part of the town  and they had talk with her about this thing
 and she said to them the lord the god of israel has said say to the man who sent you to me
 these are the words of the lord see i will send evil on this place and on its people even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of judah
 because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out
 but to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from the lord say this is what the lord the god of israel has said because you have given ear to my words
 and your heart was soft and you made yourself low before god on hearing his words about this place and its people and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me i have given ear to you says the lord god
 see i will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting place in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which i will send on this place and on its people so they took this news back to the king
 then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of judah and of jerusalem
 and the king went up to the house of the lord with all the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the lord
 then the king taking his place by the pillar made an agreement before the lord to go in the way of the lord and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book
 and he made all the people in jerusalem and benjamin give their word to keep it and the people of jerusalem kept the agreement of god the god of their fathers
 josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of israel and made all who were in israel servants of the lord their god and as long as he was living they were true to the lord the god of their fathers
 and josiah kept a passover to the lord in jerusalem on the fourteenth day of the first month they put the passover lamb to death
 and he gave the priests their places making them strong for the work of the house of god
 and he said to the levites the teachers of all israel who were holy to the lord see the holy ark is in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel made it will no longer have to be transported on your backs now be the servants of the lord your god and his people israel
 and make yourselves ready in your divisions by your families as it is ordered in the writings of david king of israel and of solomon his son
 and take your positions in the holy place grouped in the families of your brothers the children of the people and for every division let there be a part of a family of the levites
 and put the passover lamb to death and make yourselves holy and make it ready for your brothers so that the orders given by the lord through moses may be done
 and josiah gave lambs and goats from the flock as passover offerings for all the people who were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand oxen these were from the kings private property
 and his captains freely gave an offering to the people the priests and the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel the rulers of the house of god gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
 and conaniah and shemaiah and nethanel his brothers and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad the chiefs of the levites gave to the levites for the passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen
 so everything was made ready and the priests took their places with the levites in their divisions as the king had said
 and they put the passover lambs to death the blood being drained out by the priests when it was given to them and the levites did the skinning
 and they took away the burned offerings so that they might give them to be offered to the lord for the divisions of the families of the people as it is recorded in the book of moses and they did the same with the oxen
 and the passover lamb was cooked over the fire as it says in the law and the holy offerings were cooked in pots and basins and vessels and taken quickly to all the people
 and after that they made ready for themselves and for the priests for the priests the sons of aaron were offering the burned offerings and the fat till night so the levites made ready what was needed for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron
 and the sons of asaph the makers of melody were in their places as ordered by david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the door keepers were stationed at every door there was no need for them to go away from their places for their brothers the levites made ready for them
 so everything needed for the worship of the lord was made ready that same day for the keeping of the passover and the offering of burned offerings on the altar of the lord as king josiah had given orders
 and all the children of israel who were present kept the passover and the feast of unleavened bread at that time for seven days
