 and he made judah go after the lord the god of their fathers and keep his laws and his orders
 and he took away the high places and the sun images from all the towns of judah and the kingdom was quiet under his rule
 he made walled towns in judah for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years because the lord had given him rest
 he said to judah let us make these towns building walls round them with towers and doors and locks the land is still ours because we have been true to the lord our god we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side so they went on building and all went well for them
 and asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of judah armed with body covers and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand of benjamin armed with body covers and bows all these were men of war
 and zerah the ethiopian with an army of a million and three hundred war carriages came out against them to mareshah
 and asa went out against him and they put their forces in position in the valley north of mareshah
 and asa made prayer to the lord his god and said lord you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength come to our help o lord our god for our hope is in you and in your name we have come out against this great army o lord you are our god let not mans power be greater than yours
 so the lord sent fear on the ethiopians before asa and judah and the ethiopians went in flight
 and asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as gerar and so great was the destruction among the ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again for they were broken before the lord and before his army and they took away a great amount of their goods
 and they overcame all the towns round gerar because the lord sent fear on them and they took away their goods from the towns for there were stores of wealth in them
 and they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to jerusalem
 and the spirit of god came on azariah the son of oded
 and he came face to face with asa and said to him give ear to me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while you are with him if your hearts desire is for him he will be near you but if you give him up he will give you up
 now for a long time israel has been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without the law
 but when in their trouble they were turned to the lord the god of israel searching after him he let their search be rewarded
 in those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in but great trouble was on all the people of the lands
 and they were broken by divisions nation against nation and town against town because god sent all sorts of trouble on them
 but be you strong and let not your hands be feeble for your work will be rewarded
 and asa hearing these words of azariah the son of oded the prophet took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill country of ephraim and he made new again the altar of the lord in front of the covered way of the lords house
 and he got together all judah and benjamin and those of ephraim and manasseh and simeon who were living with them for numbers of them came to him out of israel when they saw that the lord his god was with him
 so they came together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the rule of asa
 and that day they made offerings to the lord of the things they had taken in war seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
 and they made an agreement to be true to the lord the god of their fathers with all their heart and all their soul
 and that anyone small or great man or woman who was not true to the lord the god of israel would be put to death
 and they made an oath to the lord with a loud voice sounding wind instruments and horns
 and all judah was glad because of the oath for they had taken it with all their heart turning to the lord with all their desire and he was with them and gave them rest on every side
 and asa would not let maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for asherah and asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream kidron
 but the high places were not taken away out of israel but still the heart of asa was true to the lord all his life
 he took into the house of god all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
