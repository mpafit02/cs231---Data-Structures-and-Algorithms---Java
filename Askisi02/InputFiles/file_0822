 and the priest will give orders for everything to be taken out of the house before he goes in to see the disease so that the things in the house may not become unclean and then the priest is to go in to see the house
 and if he sees that the walls of the house are marked with hollows of green and red and if it seems to go deeper than the face of the wall
 then the priest will go out of the door of the house and keep the house shut up for seven days
 and the priest is to come again on the seventh day and have a look and see if the marks on the walls of the house are increased in size
 then the priest will give orders to them to take out the stones in which the disease is seen and put them out into an unclean place outside the town
 and he will have the house rubbed all over inside and the paste which is rubbed off will be put out into an unclean place outside the town
 and they will take other stones and put them in place of those stones and he will take other paste and put it on the walls of the house
 and if the disease comes out again in the house after he has taken out the stones and after the walls have been rubbed and the new paste put on
 then the priest will come and see it and if the disease in the house is increased in size it is the lepers disease working out in the house it is unclean
 and the house will have to be pulled down the stones of it and the wood and the paste and everything is to be taken out to an unclean place outside the town
 and in addition anyone who goes into the house at any time while it is shut up will be unclean till evening
 and anyone who has been sleeping in the house will have to have his clothing washed and anyone who takes food in that house will have to have his clothing washed
 and if the priest comes in and sees that the disease is not increased after the new paste has been put on the house then the priest will say that the house is clean because the disease is gone
 and in order to make the house clean let him take two birds and cedar wood and red thread and hyssop
 and put one of the birds to death in a vessel of earth over flowing water
 and take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the red thread and the living bird and put them in the blood of the dead bird and in the flowing water shaking it over the house seven times
 and he will make the house clean with the blood of the bird and the flowing water and with the living bird and with the cedar wood and the hyssop and the red thread
 but he will let the living bird go out of the town into the open country so he will take away sin from the house and it will be clean
 this is the law for all signs of the lepers disease and for skin diseases
 and for signs of disease in clothing or in a house
 and for a growth or a bad place or a bright mark on the skin
 to make clear when it is unclean and when it is clean this is the law about the disease of the leper
 and the lord said to moses and to aaron
 say to the children of israel if a man has an unclean flow from his flesh it will make him unclean
 if the flow goes on or if the part is stopped up to keep back the flow he is still unclean
 every bed on which he has been resting will be unclean and everything on which he has been seated will be unclean
