 but it will be better for tyre and sidon in the day of judging than for you
 and you capernaum were you not lifted up to heaven you will go down to hell
 whoever gives ear to you gives ear to me and whoever is against you is against me and whoever is against me is against him who sent me
 and the seventy came back with joy saying lord even the evil spirits are under our power in your name
 and he said i was watching for satan falling from heaven like a star
 see i have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts and over all the strength of him who is against you and nothing will do you damage
 do not be glad however because you have power over spirits but because your names are recorded in heaven
 in that same hour he was full of joy in the holy spirit and said i give praise to you o father lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children for so o father it was pleasing in your eyes
 all things have been given to me by my father and no one has knowledge of the son but only the father and of the father but only the son and he to whom the son will make it clear
 and turning to the disciples he said privately happy are the eyes which see the things you see
 for i say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears and they had it not
 and a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test saying master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and he said to him what does the law say in your reading of it
 and he answering said have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and for your neighbour as for yourself
 and he said you have given the right answer do this and you will have life
 but he desiring to put himself in the right said to jesus and who is my neighbour
 and jesus answering him said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he got into the hands of thieves who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows and when they went away he was half dead
 and by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he went by on the other side
 and in the same way a levite when he came to the place and saw him went by on the other side
 but a certain man of samaria journeying that way came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with pity for him
 and came to him and put clean linen round his wounds with oil and wine and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him
 and the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said take care of him and if this money is not enough when i come again i will give you whatever more is needed
 which of these three men in your opinion was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves
 and he said the one who had mercy on him and jesus said go and do the same
 now while they were on their way he came to a certain town and a woman named martha took him into her house
 and she had a sister by name mary who took her seat at the lords feet and gave attention to his words
 but martha had her hands full of the work of the house and she came to him and said lord is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work say to her that she is to give me some help
 but the lord answering said to her martha martha you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things
 little is needed or even one thing only for mary has taken that good part which will not be taken away from her
 and it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place and when he came to an end one of his disciples said to him lord will you give us teaching about prayer as john did to his disciples
