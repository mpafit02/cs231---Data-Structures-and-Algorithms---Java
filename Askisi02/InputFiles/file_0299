 and from all over the earth they came to see solomon and to give ear to his wisdom which god had put in his heart
 and everyone took with him an offering vessels of silver and vessels of gold and robes and coats of metal and spices and horses and beasts of transport regularly year by year
 and solomon got together war carriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept some in the carriage towns and some with the king at jerusalem
 and the king made silver as common as stones in jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore trees of the lowlands in number
 and solomons horses came from egypt and from kue the kings traders got them at a price from kue
 a war carriage might be got from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of aram
 now a number of strange women were loved by solomon women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites
 the nations of which the lord had said to the children of israel you are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you or they will certainly make you go after their gods to these solomon was united in love
 he had seven hundred wives daughters of kings and three hundred other wives and through his wives his heart was turned away
 for it came about that when solomon was old his heart was turned away to other gods by his wives and his heart was no longer true to the lord his god as the heart of his father david had been
 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and milcom the disgusting god of the ammonites
 and solomon did evil in the eyes of the lord not walking in the lords ways with all his heart as david his father did
 then solomon put up a high place for chemosh the disgusting god of moab in the mountain before jerusalem and for molech the disgusting god worshipped by the children of ammon
 and so he did for all his strange wives who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods
 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned away from the lord the god of israel who had twice come to him in a vision
 and had given him orders about this very thing that he was not to go after other gods but he did not keep the orders of the lord
 so the lord said to solomon because you have done this and have not kept my agreement and my laws which i gave you i will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant
 i will not do it in your life time because of your father david but i will take it from your son
 still i will not take all the kingdom from him but i will give one tribe to your son because of my servant david and because of jerusalem the town of my selection
 so the lord sent hadad the edomite to make trouble for solomon he was of the kings seed in edom
 and when david had sent destruction on edom and joab the captain of the army had gone to put the dead into the earth and had put to death every male in edom
  for joab and all israel were there six months till every male in edom had been cut off 
 hadad being still a young boy went in flight to egypt with certain edomites servants of his father
 and they went on from midian and came to paran and taking men from paran with them they came to egypt to pharaoh king of egypt who gave him a house and gave orders for his food and gave him land
 now hadad was very pleasing to pharaoh so that he gave him the sister of his wife tahpenes the queen for his wife
 and the sister of tahpenes had a son by him genubath whom tahpenes took care of in pharaohs house and genubath was living in pharaohs house among pharaohs sons
 now when hadad had news in egypt that david had been put to rest with his fathers and that joab the captain of the army was dead he said to pharaoh send me back to my country
 but pharaoh said to him what have you been short of while you have been with me that you are desiring to go back to your country and he said nothing but even so send me back
 and god sent another trouble maker rezon the son of eliada who had gone in flight from his lord hadadezer king of zobah
 he got some men together and made himself captain of a band of outlaws and went to damascus and became king there
