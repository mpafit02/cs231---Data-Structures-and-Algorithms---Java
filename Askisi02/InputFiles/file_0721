 their saviour is strong the lord of armies is his name he will certainly take up their cause so that he may give rest to the earth and trouble to the people of babylon
 a sword is on the chaldaeans says the lord and on the people of babylon and on her rulers and on her wise men
 a sword is on the men of pride and they will become foolish a sword is on her men of war and they will be broken
 a sword is on all the mixed people in her and they will become like women a sword is on her store houses and they will be taken by her attackers
 a sword is on her waters drying them up for it is a land of images and their minds are fixed on false gods
 for this reason the beasts of the waste land with the wolves will make their holes there and the ostriches will be living in it never again will men be living there it will be unpeopled from generation to generation
 as when sodom and gomorrah and their neighbouring towns were overturned by god says the lord so no man will be living in it and no son of man will have a resting place there
 see a people is coming from the north a great nation and a number of kings will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth
 bows and spears are in their hands they are cruel and have no mercy their voice is like the thunder of the sea and they go on horses everyone in his place like men going to the fight against you o daughter of babylon
 the king of babylon has had news of them and his hands have become feeble trouble has come on him and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth
 see he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of jordan against the resting place of teman but i will suddenly make them go in flight from her and i will put over her the man of my selection for who is like me and who will put forward his cause against me and what keeper of sheep will keep his place before me
 so give ear to the decision of the lord which he has made against babylon and to his purposes designed against the land of the chaldaeans truly they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock truly he will make waste their fields with them
 at the cry babylon is taken  the earth is shaking and the cry comes to the ears of the nations
 the lord has said see i will make a wind of destruction come up against babylon and against those who are living in chaldaea
 and i will send men to babylon to make her clean and get her land cleared for in the day of trouble they will put up their tents against her on every side
 against her the bow of the archer is bent and he puts on his coat of metal have no mercy on her young men give all her army up to the curse
 and the dead will be stretched out in the land of the chaldaeans and the wounded in her streets
 for israel has not been given up or judah by his god by the lord of armies for their land is full of sin against the holy one of israel
 go in flight out of babylon so that every man may keep his life do not be cut off in her evil doing for it is the time of the lords punishment he will give her her reward
 babylon has been a gold cup in the hand of the lord which has made all the earth overcome with wine the nations have taken of her wine and for this cause the nations have gone off their heads
 sudden is the downfall of babylon and her destruction make cries of grief for her take sweet oil for her pain if it is possible for her to be made well
 we would have made babylon well but she is not made well give her up and let us go everyone to his country for her punishment is stretching up to heaven and lifted up even to the skies
 the lord has made clear our righteousness come and let us give an account in zion of the work of the lord our god
 make bright the arrows take up the body covers the lord has been moving the spirit of the king of the medes because his design against babylon is its destruction for it is the punishment from the lord the payment for his temple
 let the flag be lifted up against the walls of babylon make the watch strong put the watchmen in their places make ready a surprise attack for it is the lords purpose and he has done what he said about the people of babylon
 o you whose living place is by the wide waters whose stores are great your end is come your evil profit is ended
 the lord of armies has taken an oath by himself saying truly i will make you full with men as with locusts and their voices will be loud against you
 he has made the earth by his power he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out
 at the sound of his voice there is a massing of the waters in the heavens and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes the thunder flames for the rain and sends out the wind from his store houses
 then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge every gold worker is put to shame by the image he has made for his metal image is deceit and there is no breath in them
