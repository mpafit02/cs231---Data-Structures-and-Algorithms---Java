 when you get in the grain from your field if some of the grain has been dropped by chance in the field do not go back and get it but let it be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow so that the blessing of the lord your god may be on all the work of your hands

 but if the man says he will not take his brothers wife then let the wife go to the responsible men of the town and say my husbands brother will not keep his brothers name living in israel he will not do what it is right for a husbands brother to do
