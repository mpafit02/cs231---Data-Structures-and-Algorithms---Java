 let him who was a thief be so no longer but let him do good work with his hands so that he may have something to give to him who is in need
 let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is good for giving necessary teaching and for grace to those who give ear
 and do not give grief to the holy spirit of god by whom you were marked for the day of salvation
 let all bitter sharp and angry feeling and noise and evil words be put away from you with all unkind acts
 and be kind to one another full of pity having forgiveness for one another even as god in christ had forgiveness for you
 let it then be your desire to be like god as well loved children
 and be living in love even as christ had love for you and gave himself up for us an offering to god for a perfume of a sweet smell
 but evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things or desire for others property let it not even be named among you as is right for saints
 and let there be no low behaviour or foolish talk or words said in sport which are not right but in place of them the giving of praise
 being certain of this that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh no unclean person or one who has desire for the property of others or who gives worship to images has any heritage in the kingdom of christ and god
 do not be turned from the right way by foolish words for because of these things the punishment of god comes on those who do not put themselves under him
 have no part with such men
 for you at one time were dark but now are light in the lord let your behaviour be that of children of light
  because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true 
 testing by experience what is well pleasing to the lord
 and have no company with the works of the dark which give no fruit but make their true quality clear
 for the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words
 but all things when their true quality is seen are made clear by the light because everything which is made clear is light
 for this reason he says be awake you who are sleeping and come up from among the dead and christ will be your light
 take care then how you are living not as unwise but as wise
 making good use of the time because the days are evil
 for this reason then do not be foolish but be conscious of the lords pleasure
 and do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome but be full of the spirit
 joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the spirit using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the lord
 giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god even the father
 letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of christ
 wives be under the authority of your husbands as of the lord
 for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church being himself the saviour of the body
 and as the church is under christs authority so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things
 husbands have love for your wives even as christ had love for the church and gave himself for it
