 and when the king went by crying out to him he said your servant went out into the fight and a man came out to me with another man and said keep this man if by any chance he gets away your life will be the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment
 but while your servant was turning this way and that he was gone then the king of israel said to him you are responsible you have given the decision against yourself
 then he quickly took the head band from his eyes and the king of israel saw that he was one of the prophets
 and he said to him these are the words of the lord because you have let go from your hands the man whom i had put to the curse your life will be taken for his life and your people for his people
 then the king of israel went back to his house bitter and angry and came to samaria
 now naboth the jezreelite had a vine garden in jezreel near the house of ahab king of samaria
 and ahab said to naboth give me your vine garden so that i may have it for a garden of sweet plants for it is near my house and let me give you a better vine garden in exchange or if it seems good to you let me give you its value in money
 but naboth said to ahab by the lord far be it from me to give you the heritage of my fathers
 so ahab came into his house bitter and angry because naboth the jezreelite had said to him i will not give you the heritage of my fathers and stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away he would take no food
 but jezebel his wife came to him and said why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food
 and he said to her because i was talking to naboth the jezreelite and i said to him let me have your vine garden for a price or if it is pleasing to you i will give you another vine garden for it and he said i will not give you my vine garden
 then jezebel his wife said are you now the ruler of israel get up take food and let your heart be glad i will give you the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite
 so she sent a letter in ahabs name stamped with his stamp to the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority with naboth
 and in the letter she said let a time of public sorrow be fixed and put naboth at the head of the people
 and get two good for nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing god and the king then take him out and have him stoned to death
 so the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town did as jezebel had said in the letter she sent them
 they gave orders for a day of public sorrow and put naboth at the head of the people
 and the two good for nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against naboth in front of the people saying naboth has been cursing god and the king then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death
 and they sent word to jezebel saying naboth has been stoned and is dead
 then jezebel hearing that naboth had been stoned and was dead said to ahab get up and take as your heritage the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite which he would not give you for money for naboth is no longer living but is dead
 so ahab hearing that naboth was dead went down to the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite to take it as his heritage
 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
 go down to ahab king of israel in samaria see he is in the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite where he has gone to take it as his heritage
 say to him the lord says have you put a man to death and taken his heritage then say to him the lord says in the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of naboth there will your blood become the drink of dogs
 and ahab said to elijah have you come face to face with me o my hater and he said i have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the lord
 see i will send evil on you and put an end to you completely cutting off from ahab every male child him who is shut up and him who goes free in israel
 and i will make your family like the family of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the family of baasha the son of ahijah because you have made me angry and have made israel do evil
 and of jezebel the lord said jezebel will become food for dogs in the heritage of jezreel
 any man of the family of ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
  there was no one like ahab who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the lord moved to it by jezebel his wife
