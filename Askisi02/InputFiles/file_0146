 but he made answer and said to his father see all these years i have been your servant doing your orders in everything and you never gave me even a young goat so that i might have a feast with my friends
 but when this your son came who has been wasting your property with bad women you put to death the fat young ox for him
 and he said to him son you are with me at all times and all i have is yours
 but it was right to be glad and to have a feast for this your brother who was dead is living again he had gone away and has come back
 and another time he said to the disciples there was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods
 and he sent for him and said what is this which is said about you give me an account of all you have done for you will no longer be the manager of my property
 and the servant said to himself what am i to do now that my lord takes away my position i have not enough strength for working in the fields and i would be shamed if i made requests for money from people in the streets
 i have come to a decision what to do so that when i am put out of my position they will take me into their houses
 and sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first what is the amount of your debt to my lord
 and he said a hundred measures of oil and he said take your account straight away and put down fifty
 then he said to another what is the amount of your debt and he said a hundred measures of grain and he said to him take your account and put down eighty
 and his lord was pleased with the false servant because he had been wise for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light
 and i say to you make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life so that when it comes to an end you may be taken into the eternal resting places
 he who is true in a little is true in much he who is false in small things is false in great
 if then you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life who will give into your care the true wealth
 and if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people who will give you that which is yours
 no man may be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other you may not be servants of god and of wealth
 and the pharisees who had a great love of money hearing these things were making sport of him
 and he said you take care to seem right in the eyes of men but god sees your hearts and those things which are important in the opinion of men are evil in the eyes of god
 the law and the prophets were till john but then came the preaching of the kingdom of god and everyone makes his way into it by force
 but heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out
 everyone who puts away his wife and takes another is a false husband and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away is no true husband to her
 now there was a certain man of great wealth who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen and was shining and glad every day
 and a certain poor man named lazarus was stretched out at his door full of wounds
 desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds
 and in time the poor man came to his end and angels took him to abrahams breast and the man of wealth came to his end and was put in the earth
 and in hell being in great pain lifting up his eyes he saw abraham far away and lazarus on his breast
 and he gave a cry and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue for i am cruelly burning in this flame
 but abraham said keep in mind my son that when you were living you had your good things while lazarus had evil things but now he is comforted and you are in pain
 and in addition there is a deep division fixed between us and you so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so and no one may come from you to us
