 and put my cup my silver cup in the youngest ones bag with his money so he did as joseph said
 and at dawn the men with their asses were sent away
 and when they had gone only a little way out of the town joseph said to the servant who was over his house go after them and when you overtake them say to them why have you done evil in reward for good
 is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future truly you have done evil
 so he overtook them and said these words to them
 and they said to him why does my lord say such words as these far be it from your servants to do such a thing
 see the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from canaan how then might we take silver or gold from your lords house
 if it comes to light that any of your servants has done this let him be put to death and we will be your lords servants
 and he said let it be as you say he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant and you will not be responsible
 then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it
 and he made a search starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest and the cup was in benjamins bag
 then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town
 so judah and his brothers came to josephs house and he was still there and they went down on their faces before him
 and joseph said what is this thing which you have done had you no thought that such a man as i would have power to see what is secret
 and judah said what are we to say to my lord how may we put ourselves right in his eyes god has made clear the sin of your servants now we are in your hands we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen
 then he said far be it from me to do so but the man who had my cup will be my servant and you may go back to your father in peace
 then judah came near him and said let your servant say a word in my lords ears and let not your wrath be burning against your servant for you are in the place of pharaoh to us
 my lord said to his servants have you a father or a brother
 and we said to my lord we have an old father and a young child whom he had when he was old his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother and is very dear to his father
 and you said to your servants let him come down to me with you so that i may see him
 and we said to my lord his father will not let him go for if he went away his father would come to his death
 but you said to your servants if your youngest brother does not come with you you will not see my face again
 and when we went back to your servant our father we gave him an account of my lords words
 and our father said go again and get us a little food
 and we said only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down for we may not see the mans face again if our youngest brother is not with us
 and our father said to us you have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons
 the one went away from me and i said truly he has come to a violent death and from that time i have not seen him
 if now you take this one from me and some evil comes to him you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld
 if then i go back to your servant my father without the boy because his life and the boys life are one
 when he sees that the boy is not with us he will come to his death and our fathers grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld
