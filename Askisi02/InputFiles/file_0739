 though they said to god go away from us for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways
 what is the ruler of all that we may give him worship and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him
 truly is not their well being in their power  the purpose of the evil doers is far from me 
 how frequently is the light of the evil doers put out or does trouble come on them how frequently does his wrath take them with cords
 how frequently are they as dry stems before the wind or as grass taken away by the storm wind
 you say god keeps punishment stored up for his children let him send it on the man himself so that he may have the punishment of it 
 let his eyes see his trouble and let him be full of the wrath of the ruler of all 
 for what interest has he in his house after him when the number of his months is ended
 is anyone able to give teaching to god for he is the judge of those who are on high
 one comes to his end in complete well being full of peace and quiet
 his buckets are full of milk and there is no loss of strength in his bones
 and another comes to his end with a bitter soul without ever tasting good
 together they go down to the dust and are covered by the worm
 see i am conscious of your thoughts and of your violent purposes against me
 for you say where is the house of the ruler and where is the tent of the evil doer
 have you not put the question to the travellers and do you not take note of their experience
 how the evil man goes free in the day of trouble and has salvation in the day of wrath
 who will make his way clear to his face and if he has done a thing who gives him punishment for it
 he is taken to his last resting place and keeps watch over it
 the earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him and all men come after him as there were unnumbered before him
 why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit
 then eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 is it possible for a man to be of profit to god no for a mans wisdom is only of profit to himself
 is it of any interest to the ruler of all that you are upright or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin
 is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you
 is not your evil doing great and there is no end to your sins
 for you have taken your brothers goods when he was not in your debt and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it
 you do not give water to the tired traveller and from him who has no food you keep back bread
 for it was the man with power who had the land and the man with an honoured name who was living in it
 you have sent widows away without hearing their cause and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father
