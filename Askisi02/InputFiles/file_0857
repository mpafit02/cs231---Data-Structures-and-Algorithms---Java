 then i gave them an account of how the hand of my god was on me helping me and of the kings words which he had said to me and they said let us get to work on the building so they made their hands strong for the good work
 but sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian hearing of it made sport of us laughing at us and saying what are you doing will you go against the king
