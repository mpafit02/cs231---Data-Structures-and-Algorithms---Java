 and he would not let him but said to him go to your house to your friends and give them news of the great things the lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you
 and he went on his way and made public in the country of decapolis what great things jesus had done for him and all men were full of wonder
 and when jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side a great number of people came to him and he was by the sea
 and one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name came and seeing him went down at his feet
 and made strong prayers to him saying my little daughter is near to death it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her so that she may be made well and have life
 and he went with him and a great number of people went after him and came round him
 and a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years
 and had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men and had given all she had and was no better but even worse
 when she had news of the things which jesus did went among the people coming after him and put her hand on his robe
 for she said if i may only put my hand on his robe i will be made well
 and straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well
 and straight away jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him and turning to the people he said who was touching my robe
 and his disciples said to him you see the people round you on every side and you say who was touching me
 and on his looking round to see her who had done this thing
 the woman shaking with fear conscious of what had been done to her came and falling on her face before him gave him a true account of everything
 and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be free from your disease
 and while he was still talking they came from the ruler of the synagogues house saying your daughter is dead why are you still troubling the master
 but jesus giving no attention to their words said to the ruler of the synagogue have no fear only have faith
 and he did not let anyone come with him but peter and james and john the brother of james
 and they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he saw people running this way and that and weeping and crying loudly
 and when he had gone in he said to them why are you making such a noise and weeping the child is not dead but sleeping
 and they were laughing at him but he having sent them all out took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
 and taking her by the hand he said to her talitha cumi which is my child i say to you get up
 and the young girl got up straight away and was walking about she being twelve years old and they were overcome with wonder
 and he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this and he said that some food was to be given to her
 and he went away from there and came into his country and his disciples went with him
 and when the sabbath day had come he was teaching in the synagogue and a number of people hearing him were surprised saying from where did this man get these things and what is the wisdom given to this man and what are these works of power done by his hands
 is not this the woodworker the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were bitter against him
 and jesus said to them a prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his relations and in his family
 and he was unable to do any work of power there but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill and make them well
