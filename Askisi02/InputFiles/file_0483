 then the kings servants who were in the kings house said to mordecai why do you go against the kings order
 now when they had said this to him day after day and he gave no attention they let haman have news of it to see if mordecais behaviour would be overlooked for he had said to them that he was a jew
 and when haman saw that mordecai did not go down before him and give him honour haman was full of wrath
 but it was not enough for him to make an attack on mordecai only for they had made clear to him who mordecais people were so haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the jews even mordecais people through all the kingdom of ahasuerus
 in the first month the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by pur  that is chance  before haman till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar
 and haman said to king ahasuerus there is a certain nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom their laws are different from those of any other nation and they do not keep the kings laws for this reason it is not right for the king to let them be
 if it is the kings pleasure let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing and i will give to those responsible for the kings business ten thousand talents of silver for the kings store house
 and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the hater of the jews
 and the king said to haman the money is yours and the people to do with them whatever seems right to you
 then on the thirteenth day of the first month the kings scribes were sent for and they put in writing hamans orders to all the kings captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs it was signed in the name of king ahasuerus and stamped with the kings ring
 and letters were sent by the runners into every division of the kingdom ordering the death and destruction of all jews young and old little children and women on the same day even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar and the taking of all their goods by force
 a copy of the writing to be made public in every part of the kingdom was sent out to all the peoples so that they might be ready when that day came
 the runners went out quickly by the kings order and a public statement was made in shushan and the king and haman took wine together but the town of shushan was troubled
 now when mordecai saw what was done pulling off his robe he put on haircloth with dust on his head and went out into the middle of the town crying out with a loud and bitter cry
 and he came even before the kings doorway for no one might come inside the kings door clothed in haircloth
 and in every part of the kingdom wherever the kings word and his order came there was great sorrow among the jews and weeping and crying and going without food and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth
 and esthers women and her servants came and gave her word of it then great was the grief of the queen and she sent robes for mordecai so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off but he would not have them
 then esther sent for hathach one of the kings unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her and she gave him orders to go to mordecai and see what this was and why it was
 so hathach went out and saw mordecai in the open square of the town before the kings doorway
 and mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place and of the amount of money which haman had said he would put into the kings store for the destruction of the jews
 and he gave him the copy of the order which had been given out in shushan for their destruction ordering him to let esther see it and to make it clear to her and to say to her that she was to go in to the king requesting his mercy and making prayer for her people
 and hathach came back and gave esther an account of what mordecai had said
 then esther sent hathach to say to mordecai
 it is common knowledge among all the kings servants and the people of every part of the kingdom that if anyone man or woman comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for there is only one law for him that he is to be put to death only those to whom the kings rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives but i have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days
 and they said these words to mordecai
 then mordecai sent this answer back to esther do not have the idea that you in the kings house will be safe from the fate of all the jews
 if at this time you say nothing then help and salvation will come to the jews from some other place but you and your fathers family will come to destruction and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this
 then esther sent them back to mordecai with this answer
 go get together all the jews who are present in shushan and go without food for me taking no food or drink night or day for three days and i and my women will do the same and so i will go in to the king which is against the law and if death is to be my fate then let it come
 so mordecai went away and did everything as esther had said
