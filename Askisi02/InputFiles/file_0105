 the true light which gives light to every man was then coming into the world
 he was in the world the world which came into being through him but the world had no knowledge of him
 he came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts
 to all those who did so take him however he gave the right of becoming children of god  that is to those who had faith in his name
 whose birth was from god and not from blood or from an impulse of the flesh and mans desire
 and so the word became flesh and took a place among us for a time and we saw his glory  such glory as is given to an only son by his father  saw it to be true and full of grace
 john gave witness about him crying this is he of whom i said he who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me
 from his full measure we have all been given grace on grace
 for the law was given through moses grace and the true way of life are ours through jesus christ
 no man has seen god at any time the only son who is on the breast of the father he has made clear what god is
 and this is the witness of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to him with the question who are you
 he said quite openly and straightforwardly i am not the christ
 and they said to him what then are you elijah and he said i am not are you the prophet and his answer was i am not
 so they said to him who are you then we have to give some answer to those who sent us what have you to say about yourself
 he said i am the voice of one crying in the waste land make straight the way of the lord as said isaiah the prophet
 those who had been sent came from the pharisees
 and they put this question to him saying why then are you giving baptism if you are not the christ or elijah or the prophet
 johns answer was i give baptism with water but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge
 it is he who is coming after me i am not good enough to undo his shoes
 these things took place at bethany on the other side of the jordan where john was giving baptism
 the day after john sees jesus coming to him and says see here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world 
 this is he of whom i said one is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me
 i myself had no knowledge of him but i came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by israel
 and john gave this witness saying i saw the spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him
 i had no knowledge who he was but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me the one on whom you see the spirit coming down and resting it is he who gives baptism with the holy spirit
 this i saw myself and my witness is that he is the son of god
 the day after john was there again with two of his disciples
 and looking at jesus while he was walking he said see there is the lamb of god 
 hearing what he said the two disciples went after jesus
 and jesus turning round saw them coming after him and said to them what are you looking for they said to him rabbi  which is to say master  where are you living
