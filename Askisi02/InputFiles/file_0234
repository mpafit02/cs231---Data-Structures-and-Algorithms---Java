 and the nations were angry and your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged and the time of reward for your servants the prophets and for the saints and for those in whom is the fear of your name small and great and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean
 and the house of god which is in heaven was open and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earth shock and a rain of ice
 and a great sign was seen in heaven a a woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
 and she was with child and she gave a cry in the pains of childbirth
 and there was seen another sign in heaven a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven crowns
 and his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child
 and she gave birth to a son a male child who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was taken up to god and to his high seat
 and the woman went in flight to the waste land where she has a place made ready by god so that there they may give her food a thousand two hundred and sixty days
 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon and the dragon and his angels made war
 and they were overcome and there was no more place for them in heaven
 and the great dragon was forced down the old snake who is named the evil one and satan by whom all the earth is turned from the right way he was forced down to the earth and his angels were forced down with him
 and a great voice in heaven came to my ears saying now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ because he who says evil against our brothers before our god day and night is forced down
 and they overcame him through the blood of the lamb and the word of their witness and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death
 be glad then o heavens and you who are in them but there is trouble for the earth and the sea because the evil one has come down to you being very angry having the knowledge that he has but a short time
 and when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child
 and there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle so that she might go in flight into the waste land to her place where she is given food for a time and times and half a time from the face of the snake
 and the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water so that she might be taken away by the stream
 and the earth gave help to the woman and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth
 and the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed who keep the orders of god and the witness of jesus
 and he took his place on the sand of the sea and i saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on his horns ten crowns and on his heads unholy names
 and the beast which i saw was like a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
 and i saw one of his heads as if it had been given a death wound and his death wound was made well and all the earth was wondering at the beast
 and they gave worship to the dragon because he gave authority to the beast and worshipping the beast they said who is like the beast and who is able to go to war with him
 and there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against god and there was given to him authority to go on for forty two months
 and his mouth was open to say evil against god and against his name and his tent even against those who are in heaven
 and it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation
 and all who are on the earth will give him worship everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the lamb who was put to death
 if any man has ears let him give ear
 if any man sends others into prison into prison he will go if any man puts to death with the sword with the sword will he be put to death here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints
 and i saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and his voice was like that of a dragon
