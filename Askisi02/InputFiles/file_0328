 and jonathan went up gripping with his hands and his feet his servant going up after him and the philistines gave way before jonathan when he made an attack on them and his servant put them to death after him
 and at their first attack jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men all inside the space of half an acre of land
 and there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force and the attackers were shaking with fear even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from god
 and the watchmen of saul looking out from geba in the land of benjamin saw all the army flowing away and running here and there
 then saul said to the people who were with him let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us and when they had been numbered it was seen that jonathan and his servant were not there
 and saul said to ahijah let the ephod come here for he went before israel with the ephod at that time
 now while saul was talking to the priest the noise in the tents of the philistines became louder and louder and saul said to the priest take back your hand
 and saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight and every mans sword was turned against the man at his side and there was a very great noise
 then the hebrews who had been with the philistines for some time and had gone up with them to their tents turning round were joined to those who were with saul and jonathan
 and all the men of israel who had taken cover in the hill country of ephraim hearing that the philistines had been put to flight went after them attacking them
 so the lord made israel safe that day and the fight went over to beth aven
 and all the people were with saul about twenty thousand men and the fight was general through all the hill country of ephraim but saul made a great error that day by putting the people under an oath saying let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and i have given punishment to those who are against me so the people had not a taste of food
 and there was honey on the face of the field and all the people came to the honey the bees having gone from it
 but not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse
 but jonathan having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people stretching out the rod which was in his hand put the end of it in the honey and put it to his mouth then his eyes were made bright
 then one of the people said to him your father put the people under an oath saying let that man be cursed who takes any food this day and the people were feeble needing food
 then jonathan said my father has made trouble come on the land now see how bright my eyes have become because i have taken a little of this honey
 how much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them  would there not have been much greater destruction among the philistines
 that day they overcame the philistines from michmash to aijalon and the people were feeble from need of food
 and rushing at the goods taken in the fight the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen and put them to death there on the earth and had a meal taking the flesh with the blood in it
 then it was said to saul see the people are sinning against the lord taking the blood with the flesh and he said to those who gave him the news now let a great stone be rolled to me here
 and saul said go about among the people and say to them let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep and put them to death here and take his meal do no sin against the lord by taking the blood with the flesh so all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there
 and saul put up an altar to the lord this was the first altar which he put up to the lord
 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night attacking them till the morning till there is not a man of them living and they said do whatever seems right to you then the priest said let us come near to god
 and saul desiring directions from god said am i to go down after the philistines will you give them up into the hands of israel but he gave him no answer that day
 and saul said come near all you chiefs of the people and let us get word from god and see in whom is this sin today
 for by the living lord the saviour of israel even if the sinner is jonathan my son death will certainly be his fate but not a man among all the people gave him any answer
 then he said to all israel you be on one side and i with jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said to saul do whatever seems good to you
 then saul said to the lord the god of israel why have you not given me an answer today if the sin is in me or in jonathan my son o lord god of israel give urim and if it is in your people israel give thummim and by the decision of the lord saul and jonathan were marked out and the people went free
 and saul said give your decision between my son jonathan and me and jonathan was taken
