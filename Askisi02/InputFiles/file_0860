 and i sent men to them saying i am doing a great work so that it is not possible for me to come down is the work to be stopped while i go away from it and come down to you
 and four times they sent to me in this way and i sent them the same answer
 then sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand
 and in it these words were recorded it is said among the nations and geshem says so that you and the jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the kings authority and that this is why you are building the wall and they say that it is your purpose to be their king
 and that you have prophets preaching about you in jerusalem and saying there is a king in judah now an account of these things will be sent to the king so come now and let us have a discussion
 then i sent to him saying no such things as you say are being done they are only a fiction you have made up yourself
 for they were hoping to put fear in us saying their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done but now o god make my hands strong
 and i went to the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabel who was shut up and he said let us have a meeting in the house of god inside the temple and let the doors be shut for they will come to put you to death truly in the night they will come to put you to death
 and i said am i the sort of man to go in flight what man in my position would go into the temple to keep himself safe i will not go in
 then it became clear to me that god had not sent him he had given this word of a prophet against me himself and tobiah and sanballat had given him money to do so
 for this reason they had given him money in order that i might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me
 keep in mind o my god tobiah and sanballat and what they did and noadiah the woman prophet and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me
 so the wall was complete on the twenty fifth day of the month elul in fifty two days
 and when our haters had news of this all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed for they saw that this work had been done by our god
 and further in those days the chiefs of judah sent a number of letters to tobiah and his letters came to them
 for in judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him because he was the son in law of shecaniah the son of arah and his son jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah
 and they said much before me of the good he had done and gave him accounts of my words and tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear
 now when the building of the wall was complete and i had put up the doors and the door keepers and the music makers and the levites had been given their places
 i made my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the tower responsible for the government of jerusalem for he was a man of good faith fearing god more than most
 and i said to them do not let the doors of jerusalem be open till the sun is high and while the watchmen are in their places let the doors be shut and locked and let the people of jerusalem be put on watch every one in his watch opposite his house
 now the town was wide and great but the people in it were only a small number and the houses had not been put up
 and my god put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be listed by families and i came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first and in it i saw these words
 these are the people of the divisions of the kingdom among those who had been made prisoners by nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and taken away by him who went back to jerusalem and judah every one to his town
 who came with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah azariah raamiah nahamani mordecai bilshan mispereth bigvai nehum baanah the number of the men of the people of israel
 the children of parosh two thousand one hundred and seventy two
 the children of shephatiah three hundred and seventy two
 the children of arah six hundred and fifty two
 the children of pahath moab of the children of jeshua and joab two thousand eight hundred and eighteen
 the children of elam a thousand two hundred and fifty four
 the children of zattu eight hundred and forty five
