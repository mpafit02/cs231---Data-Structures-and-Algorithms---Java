 now on the third day esther put on her queens robes and took her place in the inner room of the kings house facing the kings house and the king was seated on his high seat in the kings house facing the doorway of the house
 and when the king saw esther the queen waiting in the inner room looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her so esther came near and put her fingers on the top of the rod
 then the king said what is your desire queen esther and what is your request i will give it to you even to the half of my kingdom
 and esther in answer said if it seems good to the king let the king and haman come today to the feast which i have made ready for him
 then the king said let haman come quickly so that what esther has said may be done so the king and haman came to the feast which esther had made ready
 and while they were drinking wine the king said to esther what is your prayer for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
 then esther said in answer my prayer and my request is this
 if i have the kings approval and if it is the kings pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request let the king and haman come to the feast which i will make ready for them and tomorrow i will do as the king has said
 then on that day haman went out full of joy and glad in heart but when he saw mordecai in the kings doorway and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him haman was full of wrath against mordecai
 but controlling himself he went to his house and he sent for his friends and zeresh his wife
 and he gave them an account of the glories of his wealth and the number of children he had and the ways in which he had been honoured by the king and how he had put him over the captains and servants of the king
 and haman said further truly esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast which she had made ready for the king and tomorrow again i am to be her guest with the king
 but all this is nothing to me while i see mordecai the jew seated by the kings doorway
 then his wife zeresh and all his friends said to him let a pillar fifty cubits high be made ready for hanging him and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of mordecai then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart and haman was pleased with the suggestion and he had the pillar made
 that night the king was unable to get any sleep and he sent for the books of the records and while some one was reading them to the king
 it came out that it was recorded in the book how mordecai had given word of the designs of bigthana and teresh two of the kings servants keepers of the door by whom an attack on the king had been designed
 and the king said what honour and reward have been given to mordecai for this then the servants who were waiting on the king said nothing has been done for him
 then the king said who is in the outer room now haman had come into the outer room to get the kings authority for the hanging of mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him
 and the kings servants said to him see haman is waiting in the outer room and the king said let him come in
 so haman came in and the king said to him what is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring then the thought came into hamans mind whom more than myself would the king have pleasure in honouring
 and haman answering the king said for the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 let them take the robes which the king generally puts on and the horse on which the king goes and the crown which is on his head
 and let the robes and the horse be given to one of the kings most noble captains so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring and let him go on horseback through the streets of the town with men crying out before him so let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 then the king said to haman go quickly and take the robes and the horse as you have said and do even so to mordecai the jew who is seated at the kings doorway see that you do everything as you have said
 then haman took the robes and the horse and dressing mordecai in the robes he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town crying out before him so let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 and mordecai came back to the kings doorway but haman went quickly back to his house sad and with his head covered
 and haman gave his wife zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place then his wise men and his wife zeresh said to him if mordecai who is starting to get the better of you is of the seed of the jews you will not be able to do anything against him but you will certainly go down before him
 while they were still talking the kings servants came to take haman to the feast which esther had made ready
 so the king and haman came to take wine with esther the queen
 and the king said to esther again on the second day while they were drinking what is your prayer queen esther for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
