 for he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy
 but the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let barabbas go free
 and pilate again said in answer to them what then am i to do to him to whom you give the name of the king of the jews
 and they said again loudly to the cross with him 
 and pilate said to them why what evil has he done but their cry was the louder to the cross 
 and pilate desiring to do what was pleasing to the people let barabbas go free and gave up jesus when he had been whipped to be put to death on the cross
 and the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the praetorium and they got together all the band
 and they put a purple robe on him and twisting a crown of thorns they put it on him
 and as if honouring him they said long life to the king of the jews 
 and they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and going down on their knees gave him worship
 and when they had made sport of him they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him and they took him out to put him to death on the cross
 and they made one simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus who was going by coming from the country go with them so that he might take his cross
 and they took him to the place named golgotha which is dead mans head
 and they gave him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
 and he was nailed to the cross and they made a division of his clothing among them putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take
 and it was the third hour when they put him on the cross
 and the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross the king of the jews
 and they put two thieves on crosses with him one on his right side and one on his left
   
 and those who went by made sport of him shaking their heads and saying ha  you who give the temple to destruction and put it up again in three days
 keep yourself from death and come down from the cross
 in the same way the chief priests laughing at him among themselves with the scribes said a saviour of others he has no salvation for himself
 let the christ the king of israel come down now from the cross so that we may see and have belief and those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him
 and when the sixth hour had come it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
 and at the ninth hour jesus said in a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is my god my god why are you turned away from me
 and some of those who were near hearing it said see he is crying to elijah
 and one of them went quickly and getting a sponge full of bitter wine put it on a rod and gave it to him for drink saying let be let us see if elijah will come to take him down
 and jesus gave a loud cry and gave up his spirit
 and the curtain of the temple was parted in two from end to end
 and when the captain who was near saw how he gave up his spirit he said truly this man was a son of god
