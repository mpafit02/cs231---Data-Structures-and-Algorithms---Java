 and in answer to the kings questions the woman gave him all the story so the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants saying give her back all her property and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now
 and elisha came to damascus and ben hadad king of aram was ill and they said to him the man of god has come
 then the king said to hazael take an offering with you and go to see the man of god and get directions from the lord by him saying am i going to get better from my disease
 so hazael went to see him taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from damascus and when he came before him he said your son ben hadad king of aram has sent me to you saying will i get better from this disease
 and elisha said to him go say to him you will certainly get better but the lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him
 and he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed and the man of god was overcome with weeping
 and hazael said why is my lord weeping then he said in answer because i see the evil which you will do to the children of israel burning down their strong towns putting their young men to death with the sword smashing their little ones against the stones and cutting open the women who are with child
 and hazael said how is it possible that your servant who is only a dog will do this great thing and elisha said the lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over aram
 then he went away from elisha and came in to his master who said to him what did elisha say to you and his answer was he said that you would certainly get well
 now on the day after hazael took the bed cover and making it wet with water put it over ben hadads face causing his death and hazael became king in his place
 in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah became king
 he was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years
 he went in the ways of the kings of israel as the family of ahab did for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 but it was not the lords purpose to send destruction on judah because of david his servant to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever
 in his time edom made themselves free from the rule of judah and took a king for themselves
 then joram went over to zair with all his war carriages  made an attack by night on the edomites whose forces were all round him  the captains of the war carriages and the people went in flight to their tents
 so edom made themselves free from the rule of judah to this day and at the same time libnah made itself free
 now the rest of the acts of joram and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and ahaziah his son became king in his place
 in the twelfth year that joram the son of ahab was king of israel ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah became king
 ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for one year his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel
 he went in the ways of the family of ahab and did evil in the eyes of the lord as the family of ahab did for he was a son in law of the family of ahab
 he went with joram the son of ahab to make war on hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead and joram was wounded by the aramaeans
 so king joram went back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at ramah when he was fighting against hazael king of aram and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was ill
 and elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets and said to him make yourself ready for a journey and take this bottle of oil in your hand and go to ramoth gilead
 and when you get there go in search of jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him get up from among his brothers and take him to an inner room
 then take the bottle and put the oil on his head and say the lord says i have put the holy oil on you to make you king over israel then opening the door go in flight without waiting
 so the young prophet went to ramoth gilead
 and when he came he saw the captains of the army seated together and he said i have something to say to you o captain and jehu said to which of us and he said to you o captain
 and he got up and went into the house then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him the lord the god of israel says i have made you king over the people of the lord over israel
