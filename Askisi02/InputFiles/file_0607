 however great you make the bride price and payment i will give it only let me have the girl for my wife
 but the sons of jacob gave a false answer to shechem and hamor his father because of what had been done to dinah their sister
 and they said it is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision for that would be a cause of shame to us
 but on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision
 then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people
 but if you will not undergo circumcision as we say then we will take our daughter and go
 and their words were pleasing to hamor and his son shechem
 and without loss of time the young man did as they said because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was the noblest of his fathers house
 then hamor and shechem his son went to the meeting place of their town and said to the men of the town
 it is the desire of these men to be at peace with us let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here for the country is wide open before them let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters
 but these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done
 then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us
 then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of hamor and shechem his son and every male in the town underwent circumcision
 but on the third day after before the wounds were well two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brothers took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death
 and hamor and his son they put to death with the sword and they took dinah from shechems house and went away
 and the sons of jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister
 they took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields
 and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives everything in their houses they took and made them waste
 and jacob said to simeon and levi you have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country among the canaanites and the perizzites and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me and it will be the end of me and all my people
 but they said were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman
 and god said to jacob go up now to beth el and make your living place there and put up an altar there to the god who came to you when you were in flight from your brother esau
 then jacob said to all his people put away the strange gods which are among you and make yourselves clean and put on a change of clothing
 and let us go up to beth el and there i will make an altar to god who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble and was with me wherever i went
 then they gave to jacob all the strange gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears and jacob put them away under the holy tree at shechem
 so they went on their journey and the fear of god was on the towns round about so that they made no attack on the sons of jacob
 and jacob came to luz in the land of canaan  which is the same as beth el  he and all his people
 and there he made an altar naming the place el beth el because it was there he had the vision of god when he was in flight from his brother
 and deborah the servant who had taken care of rebekah from her birth came to her end and was put to rest near beth el under the holy tree and they gave it the name of allon bacuth
 now when jacob was on his way from paddan aram god came to him again and blessing him said
 jacob is your name but it will be so no longer from now your name will be israel so he was named israel
