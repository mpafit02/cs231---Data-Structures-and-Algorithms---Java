 for the vine garden of the lord of armies is the people of israel and the men of judah are the plant of his delight and he was looking for upright judging and there was blood for righteousness and there was a cry for help
 cursed are those who are joining house to house and putting field to field till there is no more living space for any but themselves in all the land 
 the lord of armies has said to me secretly truly numbers of great and fair houses will be waste with no one living in them
 for ten fields of vines will only give one measure of wine and a great amount of seed will only give a small measure of grain
 cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine 
 and corded instruments and wind instruments and wine are in their feasts but they give no thought to the work of the lord and they are not interested in what his hands are doing
 for this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge and their rulers are wasted for need of food and their loud voiced feasters are dry for need of water
 for this cause the underworld has made wide its throat opening its mouth without limit and her glory and the noise of her masses and her loud voiced feasters will go down into it
 and the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face and the eyes of pride are put to shame
 but the lord of armies is lifted up as judge and the holy god is seen to be holy in righteousness
 then the lambs will get food as in their grass lands and the fat cattle will be feasting in the waste places
 cursed are those who make use of ox cords for pulling the evil thing and the bands of a young ox for their sin 
 who say let him do his work quickly let him make it sudden so that we may see it let the design of the holy one of israel come near so that it may be clear to us
 cursed are those who give the name of good to evil and of evil to what is good who make light dark and dark light who make bitter sweet and sweet bitter 
 cursed are those who seem wise to themselves and who take pride in their knowledge 
 cursed are those who are strong to take wine and great in making mixed drinks 
 who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him
 for this cause as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire and as the dry grass goes down before the flame so their root will be like the dry stems of grain and their flower will go up in dust because they have gone against the law of the lord of armies and have given no honour to the word of the holy one of israel
 for this reason the wrath of the lord has been burning against his people and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment and the hills were shaking and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town
 and he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a far off nation whistling to them from the ends of the earth and they will come quickly and suddenly
 there is no weariness among them and no man is feeble footed they come without resting or sleeping and the cord of their shoes is not broken
 their arrows are sharp and every bow is bent the feet of their horses are like rock and their wheels are like a rushing storm
 the sound of their armies will be like the voice of a lion and their war cry like the noise of young lions with loud cries they will come down on their food and will take it away safely and there will be no one to take it out of their hands
 and his voice will be loud over him in that day like the sounding of the sea and if a mans eyes are turned to the earth it is all dark and full of trouble and the light is made dark by thick clouds
 this is the word of the lord where is the statement which i gave your mother when i put her away or to which of my creditors have i given you for money it was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others and for your evil doing was your mother put away
 why then when i came was there no man and no one to give answer to my voice has my hand become feeble so that it is unable to take up your cause or have i no power to make you free see at my word the sea becomes dry i make the rivers a waste land their fish are dead for need of water and make an evil smell
 by me the heavens are clothed with black and i make haircloth their robe
 the lord god has given me the tongue of those who are experienced so that i may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble every morning my ear is open to his teaching like those who are experienced
 and i have not put myself against him or let my heart be turned back from him
 i was offering my back to those who gave me blows and my face to those who were pulling out my hair i did not keep my face covered from marks of shame
