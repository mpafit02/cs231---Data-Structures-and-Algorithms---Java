 and paul said john gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him that is in jesus
 and hearing this they had baptism in the name of the lord jesus
 and when paul had put his hands on them the holy spirit came on them and they had the power of talking in tongues and acting like prophets
 and there were about twelve of these men
 and he went into the synagogue and for three months he was preaching there without fear reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of god
 but because some of the people were hard hearted and would not give hearing saying evil words about the way before the people he went away from them and kept the disciples separate reasoning every day in the school of tyrannus
 and this went on for two years so that all those who were living in asia had knowledge of the word of the lord greeks as well as jews
 and god did special works of power by the hands of paul
 so that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out
 but some of the jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits took it on themselves to make use of the name of the lord jesus over those who had evil spirits saying i give you orders by jesus whom paul is preaching
 and there were seven sons of a man named sceva a jew and a chief priest who did this
 and the evil spirit answering said to them i have knowledge of jesus and of paul but who are you
 and the man in whom the evil spirit was jumping on them was stronger than the two of them and overcame them so that they went running from that house wounded and without their clothing
 and this came to the ears of all those jews and greeks who were living at ephesus and fear came on them all and the name of the lord jesus was made great
 and a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts
 and a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver
 so the word of the lord was increased very greatly and was full of power
 now after these things were ended paul came to a decision that when he had gone through macedonia and achaia he would go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i have a desire to see rome
 and having sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus into macedonia he himself went on living in asia for a time
 and about that time a great outcry took place about the way
 for there was a certain man named demetrius a silver worker who made silver boxes for the images of diana and gave no small profit to the workmen
 whom he got together with other workmen of the same trade and said to them men it is clear that from this business we get our wealth
 and you see for it has come to your ears that not only at ephesus but almost all through asia this paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away saying that those are not gods who are made by mens hands
 and there is danger not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men but that the holy place of the great goddess diana may be no longer honoured and that she to whom all asia and the world give worship will be put down from her high position
 and hearing this they were very angry crying out and saying great is diana of ephesus
 and the town was full of noise and trouble and they all came running into the theatre having taken by force gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia who were journeying in company with paul
 and when paul was about to go in to the people the disciples did not let him
 and some of the rulers of asia being his friends sent to him requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre
 and some said one thing and some another for there was no order in the meeting and most of them had no idea why they had come together
 then they took alexander out from among the people the jews putting him forward and alexander making a sign with his hand was about to make a statement to the people in answer
