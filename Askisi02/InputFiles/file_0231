 but jesus turning and seeing her said daughter take heart your faith has made you well and the woman was made well from that hour
 and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise
 he said make room for the girl is not dead but sleeping and they were laughing at him
 but when the people were sent out he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up
 and the news of it went out into all that land
 and when jesus went on from there two blind men came after him crying out have mercy on us you son of david
 and when he had come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them have you faith that i am able to do this they said to him yes lord
 then he put his hand on their eyes saying as your faith is let it be done to you
 and their eyes were made open and jesus said to them sharply let no man have knowledge of it
 but they went out and gave news of him in all that land
 and while they were going away there came to him a man without the power of talking and with an evil spirit
 and when the evil spirit had been sent out the man had the power of talking and they were all surprised saying such a thing has never been seen in israel
 but the pharisees said by the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
 and jesus went about all the towns and small places teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain
 but when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper
 then he said to his disciples there is much grain but not enough men to get it in
 make prayer then to the lord of the grain fields that he may send out workers to get in his grain
 paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother to philemon our dear helper in the faith
 and to apphia our sister and to archippus our brother in gods army and to the church in your house
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to god at all times and make prayer for you
 hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the lord jesus and to all the saints
 that the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power in the knowledge of every good thing in you for christ
 for i had great joy and comfort in your love because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you brother
 and so though i might in the name of christ give you orders to do what is right
 still because of love in place of an order i make a request to you i paul an old man and now a prisoner of christ jesus
 my request is for my child onesimus the child of my chains
 who in the past was of no profit to you but now is of profit to you and to me
 whom i have sent back to you him who is my very heart
 though my desire was to keep him with me to be my servant in the chains of the good news in your place
