 this discussion of the people came to the ears of the pharisees and the chief priests and the pharisees sent servants to take him
 then jesus said i will be with you a little longer and then i go to him who sent me
 you will be looking for me and you will not see me and where i am you may not come
 so the jews said among themselves to what place is he going where we will not see him will he go to the jews living among the greeks and become the teacher of the greeks
 what is this saying of his you will be looking for me and will not see me and where i am you may not come
 on the last day the great day of the feast jesus got up and said in a loud voice if any man is in need of drink let him come to me and i will give it to him
 he who has faith in me out of his body as the writings have said will come rivers of living water
 this he said of the spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him the spirit had not been given then because the glory of jesus was still to come
 when these words came to their ears some of the people said this is certainly the prophet
 others said this is the christ but others said not so will the christ come from galilee
 do not the writings say that the christ comes of the seed of david and from beth lehem the little town where david was
 so there was a division among the people because of him
 and some of them had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him
 then the servants went back to the chief priests and pharisees who said to them why have you not got him with you
 the servants made answer no man ever said things like this man
 then the pharisees said to them have you like the others been given false ideas
 have any of the rulers belief in him or any one of the pharisees
 but these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed
 nicodemus  he who had come to jesus before being himself one of them  said to them
 is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done
 this was their answer and do you come from galilee make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of galilee
  and every man went to his house
 but jesus went to the mountain of olives
 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them
 now the scribes and pharisees came with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation
 and putting her forward they said to him master this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation
 now in the law moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned what do you say about it
 they said this testing him so that they might have something against him but jesus with his head bent down made letters on the floor with his finger
 but when they went on with their questions he got up and said to them let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her
 and again with bent head he made letters on the floor
