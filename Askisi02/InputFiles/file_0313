 he did a very disgusting thing in going after false gods doing all the things the amorites did whom the lord sent out before the children of israel 
 hearing these words ahab in great grief put haircloth on his flesh and went without food sleeping in haircloth and going about quietly
 then the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
 do you see how ahab has made himself low before me because he has made himself low before me i will not send the evil in his life time but in his sons time i will send the evil on his family
 now for three years there was no war between aram and israel
 and it came about in the third year that jehoshaphat king of judah came down to the king of israel
 and the king of israel said to his servants do you not see that ramoth gilead is ours and we are doing nothing to get it back from the hands of the king of aram
 and he said to jehoshaphat will you go with me to ramoth gilead to make war and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses
 then jehoshaphat said to the king of israel let us now get directions from the lord
 so the king of israel got all the prophets together about four hundred men and said to them am i to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and they said go up for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 but jehoshaphat said is there no other prophet of the lord here from whom we may get directions
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is still one man by whom we may get directions from the lord micaiah son of imlah but i have no love for him for he is a prophet of evil to me and not of good and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
 then the king of israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said go quickly and come back with micaiah the son of imlah
 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said the lord says pushing back the aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
 and all the prophets said the same thing saying go up to ramoth gilead and it will go well for you for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 now the servant who had gone to get micaiah said to him see now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
 and micaiah said by the living lord whatever the lord says to me i will say
 when he came to the king the king said to him micaiah are we to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and in answer he said go up and it will go well for you and the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 then the king said to him have i not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the lord
 then he said i saw all israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the lord said these have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil
 and he said give ear now to the word of the lord i saw the lord seated on his seat of power with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left
 and the lord said how may ahab be tricked into going up to ramoth gilead to his death and one said one thing and one another
 then a spirit came forward and took his place before the lord and said i will get him to do it by a trick
 and the lord said how and he said i will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
 and now see the lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets and the lord has said evil against you
 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and gave micaiah a blow on the side of the face saying where is the spirit of the lord whose word is in you
 and micaiah said truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
 and the king of israel said take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the town and to joash the kings son
