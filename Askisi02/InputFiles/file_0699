 the prophet whose words are of peace when his words come true will be seen to be a prophet whom the lord has sent
 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of the prophet jeremiah and it was broken by his hands
 and before all the people hananiah said the lord has said even so will i let the yoke of the king of babylon be broken off the necks of all the nations in the space of two years then the prophet jeremiah went away
 then after the yoke had been broken off the neck of the prophet jeremiah by hananiah the prophet the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 go and say to hananiah this is what the lord has said yokes of wood have been broken by you but in their place i will make yokes of iron
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said i have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations making them servants to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they are to be his servants and in addition i have given him the beasts of the field
 then the prophet jeremiah said to hananiah the prophet give ear now hananiah the lord has not sent you but you are making this people put their faith in what is false
 for this reason the lord has said see i will send you away from off the face of the earth this year death will overtake you because you have said words against the lord
 so death came to hananiah the prophet the same year in the seventh month
 now these are the words of the letter which jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem to the responsible men among those who had been taken away and to the priests and the prophets and to all the rest of the people whom nebuchadnezzar had taken away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
  after jeconiah the king and the queen mother and the unsexed servants and the rulers of judah and jerusalem and the expert workmen and the metal workers had gone away from jerusalem 
 by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah  whom zedekiah king of judah sent to babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said to all those whom i have taken away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
 take wives and have sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands so that they may have sons and daughters and be increased in number there and do not become less
 and be working for the peace of the land to which i have had you taken away prisoners and make prayer to the lord for it for in its peace you will have peace
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said do not let yourselves be tricked by the prophets who are among you and the readers of signs and give no attention to their dreams which they may have
 for they are saying to you what is false in my name i have not sent them says the lord
 for this is what the lord has said when seventy years are ended for babylon i will have pity on you and give effect to my good purpose for you causing you to come back to this place
 for i am conscious of my thoughts about you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you hope at the end
 and you will go on crying to me and making prayer to me and i will give ear to you
 and you will be searching for me and i will be there when you have gone after me with all your heart
 i will be near you again says the lord and your fate will be changed and i will get you together from all the nations and from all the places where i had sent you away says the lord and i will take you back again to the place from which i sent you away prisoners
 for you have said the lord has given us prophets in babylon
 for this is what the lord has said about the king who is seated on the seat of davids kingdom and about all the people living in this town your countrymen who have not gone out with you as prisoners
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will send on them the sword and need of food and disease and will make them like bad figs which are of no use for food they are so bad
 i will go after them attacking them with the sword and with need of food and with disease and will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and a wonder and a surprise and a name of shame among all the nations where i have sent them
 because they have not given ear to my words says the lord when i sent to them my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you did not give ear says the lord
 and now give ear to the word of the lord all you whom i have sent away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said about ahab the son of kolaiah and about zedekiah the son of maaseiah who are saying to you what is false in my name see i will give them up into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he will put them to death before your eyes
