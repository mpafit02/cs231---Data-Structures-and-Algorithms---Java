 my haters are ever ready to put an end to me great numbers are lifting themselves up against me
 in the time of my fear i will have faith in you
 in god will i give praise to his word in god have i put my hope i will have no fear of what flesh may do to me

 for your mercy is great stretching up to the heavens and your righteousness goes up to the clouds
 be lifted up o god higher than the heavens let your glory be over all the earth
 &ltto the chief music maker put to al tashheth michtam of david&gt is there righteousness in your mouths o you gods are you upright judges o you sons of men
 the purposes of your hearts are evil your hands are full of cruel doings on the earth
 the evil doers are strange from the first from the hour of their birth they go out of the true way saying false words
 their poison is like the poison of a snake they are like the adder whose ears are shut
