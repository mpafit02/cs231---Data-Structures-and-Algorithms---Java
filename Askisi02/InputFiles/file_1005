 we do not see our signs there is no longer any prophet or anyone among us to say how long
 o god how long will those who are against us say cruel things will the hater go on looking down on your name for ever
 why are you keeping back your hand and covering your right hand in your robe
 for from the past god is my king working salvation in the earth
 the sea was parted in two by your strength the heads of the great sea beasts were broken
 the heads of the great snake were crushed by you you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea
 you made valleys for fountains and springs you made the ever flowing rivers dry
 the day is yours and the night is yours you made the light and the sun
 by you all the limits of the earth were fixed you have made summer and winter
 keep this in mind o lord that your haters have said cruel things and that your name has been looked down on by a people of evil behaviour
 o give not the soul of your dove to the hawk let not the life of the poor go out of your memory for ever
 keep in mind your undertaking for the dark places of the earth are full of pride and cruel acts
 o let not the crushed be turned back in shame let the low man and the poor give praise to your name
 up  o god be the judge of your cause keep in mind the bitter things which the man of evil behaviour says against you every day
 keep in mind the voice of your haters the outcry of those who come against you goes up every day
 &ltto the chief music maker put to al tashheth a psalm of asaph a song&gt to you o god we give praise to you we give praise and those who give honour to your name make clear your works of power
 when the right time has come i will be the judge in righteousness
 when the earth and all its people become feeble i am the support of its pillars  selah 
 i say to the men of pride let your pride be gone and to the sinners let not your horn be lifted up
 let not your horn be lifted up let no more words of pride come from your outstretched necks
 for honour does not come from the east or from the west or uplifting from the south
 but god is the judge putting down one and lifting up another
 for in the hand of the lord is a cup and the wine is red it is well mixed overflowing from his hand he will make all the sinners of the earth take of it even to the last drop
 but i will ever be full of joy making songs of praise to the god of jacob
 by him will all the horns of the sinners be cut off but the horns of the upright will be lifted up
 &ltto the chief music maker put to neginoth a psalm of asaph a song&gt 
 in judah is the knowledge of god his name is great in israel
 in salem is his tent his resting place in zion
 there were the arrows of the bow broken there he put an end to body cover sword and fight  selah 
 you are shining and full of glory more than the eternal mountains
