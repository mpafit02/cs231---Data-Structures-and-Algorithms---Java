 talking of the god of jerusalem as if he was like the gods of the peoples of the earth the work of mens hands
 and hezekiah the king and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz made prayer because of this crying out to heaven
 and the lord sent an angel who put to death all the men of war and the chiefs and the captains in the army of the king of assyria so he went back to his country in shame and when he came into the house of his god his sons the offspring of his body put him to death there with the sword
 so the lord gave hezekiah and the people of jerusalem salvation from the power of sennacherib the king of assyria and from all others giving them rest on every side
 and great numbers came to jerusalem with offerings for the lord and things of great price for hezekiah king of judah so that he was honoured among all nations from that time
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and he made prayer to the lord and the lord in answer gave him a sign
 but hezekiah did not do as had been done to him for his heart was lifted up in pride and so wrath came on him and on judah and jerusalem
 but then hezekiah in sorrow for what he had done put away his pride and he and all jerusalem made themselves low so that the wrath of the lord did not come on them in hezekiahs life time
 and hezekiah had very great wealth and honour and he made himself store houses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices and for body covers and all sorts of beautiful vessels
 and store houses for the produce of grain and wine and oil and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks
 and he made towns for himself and got together much property in flocks and herds for god had given him great wealth
 it was hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of gihon stopped and the water taken down on the west side of the town of david in everything he undertook hezekiah did well
 however in the business of the representatives sent by the rulers of babylon to get news of the wonder which had taken place in the land god gave up guiding him testing him to see what was in his heart
 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and the good he did are recorded in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 so hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the higher part of the resting places of the sons of david and all judah and the people of jerusalem gave him honour at his death and manasseh his son became king in his place
 manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he was ruling for fifty five years in jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the lord had sent out of the land before the children of israel
 for he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by his father hezekiah and he made altars for the baals and pillars of wood and was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
 and he made altars in the house of the lord of which the lord had said in jerusalem will my name be for ever
 and he made altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the lord
 more than this he made his children go through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom and he made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future and unnatural powers and gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder workers he did much evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath
 and he put the image he had made in the house of god the house of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem the town which i have made mine out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
 and never again will i let the feet of israel be moved out of the land which i have given to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders even all the law and the orders and the rules given to them by moses
 and manasseh made judah and the people of jerusalem go out of the true way so that they did more evil than those nations whom the lord gave up to destruction before the children of israel
 and the word of the lord came to manasseh and his people but they gave no attention
 so the lord sent against them the captains of the army of assyria who made manasseh a prisoner and took him away in chains to babylon
 and crying out to the lord his god in his trouble he made himself low before the god of his fathers
 and made prayer to him and in answer to his prayer god let him come back to jerusalem and to his kingdom then manasseh was certain that the lord was god
 after this he made an outer wall for the town of david on the west side of gihon in the valley as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway and he put a very high wall round the ophel and he put captains of the army in all the walled towns of judah
 he took away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the lord and all the altars he had put up on the hill of the lords house and in jerusalem and put them out of the town
