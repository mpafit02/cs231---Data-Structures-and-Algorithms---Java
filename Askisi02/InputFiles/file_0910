 in the lips of him who has knowledge wisdom is seen but a rod is ready for the back of him who is without sense
 knowledge is stored up by the wise but the mouth of the foolish man is a destruction which is near
 the property of the man of wealth is his strong town the poor mans need is his destruction
 the work of the upright gives life the increase of the evil doer is a cause of sin
 he who takes note of teaching is a way of life but he who gives up training is a cause of error
 hate is covered up by the lips of the upright man but he who lets out evil about another is foolish
 where there is much talk there will be no end to sin but he who keeps his mouth shut does wisely
 the tongue of the upright man is like tested silver the heart of the evil doer is of little value
 the lips of the upright man give food to men but the foolish come to death for need of sense
 the blessing of the lord gives wealth hard work makes it no greater
 it is sport to the foolish man to do evil but the man of good sense takes delight in wisdom
 the thing feared by the evil doer will come to him but the upright man will get his desire
 when the storm wind is past the sinner is seen no longer but the upright man is safe for ever
 like acid drink to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the hater of work to those who send him
 the fear of the lord gives long life but the years of the evil doer will be cut short
 the hope of the upright man will give joy but the waiting of the evil doer will have its end in sorrow
 the way of the lord is a strong tower for the upright man but destruction to the workers of evil
 the upright man will never be moved but evil doers will not have a safe resting place in the land
 the mouth of the upright man is budding with wisdom but the twisted tongue will be cut off
 the lips of the upright man have knowledge of what is pleasing but twisted are the mouths of evil doers
 scales of deceit are hated by the lord but a true weight is his delight
 when pride comes there comes shame but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit
 the righteousness of the upright will be their guide but the twisted ways of the false will be their destruction
 wealth is of no profit in the day of wrath but righteousness keeps a man safe from death
 the righteousness of the good man will make his way straight but the sin of the evil doer will be the cause of his fall
 the righteousness of the upright will be their salvation but the false will themselves be taken in their evil designs
 at the death of an upright man his hope does not come to an end but the hope of the evil doer comes to destruction
 the upright man is taken out of trouble and in his place comes the sinner
 with his mouth the evil man sends destruction on his neighbour but through knowledge the upright are taken out of trouble
 when things go well for the upright man all the town is glad at the death of sinners there are cries of joy
