 for moses said give honour to your father and mother and he who says evil of father or mother let him have the punishment of death
 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother that by which you might have had profit from me is corban that is to say given to god
 you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother
 making the word of god of no effect by your rule which you have given and a number of other such things you do
 and turning to the people again he said to them give ear to me all of you and let my words be clear to you
 there is nothing outside the man which going into him is able to make him unclean but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean
   
 and when he had gone into the house away from all the people his disciples put questions to him about the saying
 and he said to them have even you so little wisdom do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean
 because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach and goes out with the waste he said this making all food clean
 and he said that which comes out of the man that makes the man unclean
 because from inside from the heart of men come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures
 the taking of goods and of life broken faith between husband and wife the desire of wealth wrongdoing deceit sins of the flesh an evil eye angry words pride foolish acts
 all these evil things come from inside and make the man unclean
 and he went away from there to the country of tyre and sidon and he went into a house desiring that no man might have knowledge of it and he was not able to keep it secret
 but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having had news of him came straight away and went down at his feet
 now the woman was a greek a syro phoenician by birth and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter
 and he said to her let the children first have their food for it is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
 but she said to him in answer yes lord even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children
 and he said to her for this saying go your way the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter
 and she went away to her house and saw the child on the bed and the evil spirit gone out
 and again he went out from tyre and came through sidon to the sea of galilee through the country of decapolis
 and they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking and they made a request to him to put his hands on him
 and he took him on one side from the people privately and put his fingers into his ears and he put water from his mouth on the mans tongue with his finger
 and looking up to heaven he took a deep breath and said to him ephphatha that is be open
 and his ears became open and the band of his tongue was made loose and his words became clear
 and he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone but the more he made this request so much the more they made it public
 and they were overcome with wonder saying he has done all things well he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them
 in those days again when there was a great mass of people and they had no food he made his disciples come to him and said to them
 i have pity for these people because they have been with me now three days and have no food
