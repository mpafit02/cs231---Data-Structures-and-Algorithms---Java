 and they went after other gods and gave them worship gods who were strange to them and whom he had not given them
 and so the wrath of the lord was moved against this land to send on it all the curse recorded in this book
 rooting them out of their land in the heat of his wrath and passion and driving them out into another land as at this day
 the secret things are the lord our gods but the things which have been made clear are ours and our childrens for ever so that we may do all the words of this law
 then turning we took the road to bashan and og king of bashan came out against us with all his people and made an attack on us at edrei
 and the lord said to me have no fear of him for i have given him and all his people and his land into your hands do to him as you did to sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon
 so the lord our god gave up og king of bashan and all his people into our hands and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight
 at that time we took all his towns there was not one town of the sixty towns all the country of argob the kingdom of og in bashan which we did not take
 all these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns
 and we put them to the curse every town together with men women and children
 but we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns
 at that time we took their land from the two kings of the amorites on the far side of jordan from the valley of the arnon to mount hermon
  by the sidonians hermon is named sirion and by the amorites shenir 
 all the towns of the table land and all gilead and bashan as far as salecah and edrei towns of the kingdom of og in bashan
  for og king of bashan was the last of all the rephaim his bed was made of iron is it not in rabbah in the land of the children of ammon it was nine cubits long and four cubits wide measured by the common cubit 
 and this land which we took at that time from aroer by the valley of the arnon and half the hill country of gilead with its towns i gave to the reubenites and the gadites
 the rest of gilead and all bashan the kingdom of og all the land of argob together with bashan i gave to the half tribe of manasseh  this land is named the land of the rephaim
 jair the son of manasseh took all the land of argob as far as the country of the geshurites and the maacathites naming it bashan havvoth jair after himself as it is to this day 
 and gilead i gave to machir
 and the land from gilead to the valley of the arnon with the middle of the valley as a limit as far as the river jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of ammon i gave to the reubenites and the gadites
 as well as the arabah with the river jordan as their limit from chinnereth to the salt sea under the slopes of pisgah to the east
 at that time i gave you orders saying the lord has given you this land for your heritage all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of israel
 but your wives and your little ones and your cattle  for it is clear that you have much cattle  may go on living in the towns i have given you
 till the lord has given rest to your brothers as to you and till they have taken for themselves the land which the lord your god is giving them on the other side of jordan then you may go back every man of you to the heritage which i have given you
 and i gave orders to joshua at that time saying your eyes have seen what the lord your god has done to these two kings so will the lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come
 have no fear of them for the lord your god will be fighting for you
 and at that time i made request to the lord saying
 o lord god you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power
 let me go over o lord and see the good land on the other side of jordan and that fair mountain country even lebanon
 but the lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer and the lord said to me let it be enough say no more about this thing
