 but the people took some of their goods sheep and oxen the chief of the things which were put to the curse to make an offering of them to the lord your god in gilgal
 and samuel said has the lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders truly to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep
 for to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts and pride is like giving worship to images because you have put away from you the word of the lord he has put you from your place as king
 and saul said to samuel great is my sin for i have gone against the orders of the lord and against your words because fearing the people i did what they said
 so now let my sin have forgiveness and go back with me to give worship to the lord
 and samuel said to saul i will not go back with you for you have put away from you the word of the lord and the lord has put you from your place as king over israel
 and when samuel was turning round to go away saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand and the cloth came away
 and samuel said to him the lord has taken away the kingdom of israel from you this day by force and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you
 and further the glory of israel will not say what is false and his purpose may not be changed for he is not a man whose purpose may be changed
 then he said great is my sin but still give me honour now before the heads of my people and before israel and come back with me so that i may give worship to the lord your god
 so samuel went back after saul and saul gave worship to the lord
 then samuel said make agag the king of the amalekites come here to me and agag came to him shaking with fear and agag said truly the pain of death is past
 and samuel said as your sword has made women without children so now your mother will be without children among women and agag was cut up by samuel bone from bone before the lord in gilgal
 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house in gibeah in the land of saul
 and samuel never saw saul again till the day of his death but samuel was sorrowing for saul and it was no longer the lords pleasure for saul to be king over israel
 and the lord said to samuel how long will you go on sorrowing for saul seeing that i have put him from his place as king over israel take oil in your vessel and go i will send you to jesse the beth lehemite for i have got a king for myself among his sons
 and samuel said how is it possible for me to go if saul gets news of it he will put me to death and the lord said take a young cow with you and say i have come to make an offering to the lord
 and send for jesse to be present at the offering and i will make clear to you what you are to do and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name i give you
 and samuel did as the lord said and came to beth lehem and the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said do you come in peace
 and he said in peace i have come to make an offering to the lord make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering and he made jesse and his sons clean and sent for them to be present at the offering
 now when they came looking at eliab he said clearly the man of the lords selection is before him
 but the lord said to samuel do not take note of his face or how tall he is because i will not have him for the lords view is not mans man takes note of the outer form but the lord sees the heart
 then jesse sent for abinadab and made him come before samuel and he said the lord has not taken this one
 then jesse made shammah come before him and he said the lord has not taken this one
 and jesse made his seven sons come before samuel and samuel said to jesse the lord has not taken any of these
 then samuel said to jesse are all your children here and he said there is still the youngest and he is looking after the sheep and samuel said to jesse send and make him come here for we will not take our seats till he is here
 so he sent and made him come in now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks and the lord said come put the oil on him for this is he
 then samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on him there among his brothers and from that day the spirit of the lord came on david with power so samuel went back to ramah
 now the spirit of the lord had gone from saul and an evil spirit from the lord was troubling him
 and sauls servants said to him see now an evil spirit from god is troubling you
