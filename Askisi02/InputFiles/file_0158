 and the lord turning gave peter a look and the words of the lord came to peters mind how he had said this night before the hour of the cocks cry you will be false to me three times
 and he went out weeping bitterly
 and the men in whose hands jesus was made sport of him and gave him blows
 and covering his eyes they said to him are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow
 and they said a number of other evil things against him
 and when it was day the rulers of the people came together with the chief priests and the scribes and they took him before their sanhedrin saying
 if you are the christ say so but he said if i say so you will not have belief
 and if i put a question to you you will not give an answer
 but in the future the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
 and they all said are you then the son of god and he said you say that i am
 and they said what more need have we of witness we have the very words of his mouth
 and they all went and took him before pilate
 and they made statements against him saying this man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong and not to make payment of taxes to caesar even saying that he himself is christ a king
 and pilate said to him are you the king of the jews and he said in answer you say so
 and pilate said to the chief priests and the people in my opinion this man has done no wrong
 but they became more violent than before saying he has made trouble among the people teaching through all judaea from galilee to this place
 but at these words pilate said is the man a galilaean
 and when he saw that he was under the authority of herod he sent him to herod who was in jerusalem himself at that time
 now when herod saw jesus he was very glad having for a long time had a desire to see him for he had had accounts of him and was hoping to see some wonders done by him
 and he put a great number of questions to him but he said nothing
 and the chief priests and the scribes were there making statements against him violently
 and herod with the men of his army put shame on him and made sport of him and dressing him in shining robes he sent him back to pilate
 and that day herod and pilate became friends with one another for before they had been against one another
 and pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people and said to them
 you say that this man has been teaching the people evil things now i after going into the question before you see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him
 and herod is of the same opinion for he has sent him back to us for you see he has done nothing for which i might put him to death
 and so i will give him punishment and let him go
   
 but with loud voices they said all together put this man to death and make barabbas free
 now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town in which there had been loss of life
