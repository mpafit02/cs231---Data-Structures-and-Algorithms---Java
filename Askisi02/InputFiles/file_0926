 as clouds and wind without rain so is one who takes credit for an offering he has not given
 a judge is moved by one who for a long time undergoes wrongs without protest and by a soft tongue even bone is broken
 if you have honey take only as much as is enough for you for fear that being full of it you may not be able to keep it down
 let not your foot be frequently in your neighbours house or he may get tired of you and his feeling be turned to hate
 one who gives false witness against his neighbour is a hammer and a sword and a sharp arrow
 putting ones faith in a false man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a shaking foot
 like one who takes off clothing in cold weather and like acid on a wound is he who makes melody to a sad heart
 if your hater is in need of food give him bread and if he is in need of drink give him water
 for so you will put coals of fire on his head and the lord will give you your reward
 as the north wind gives birth to rain so is an angry face caused by a tongue saying evil secretly
 it is better to be living in an angle of the house top than with a bitter tongued woman in a wide house
 as cold water to a tired soul so is good news from a far country
 like a troubled fountain and a dirty spring is an upright man who has to give way before evil doers
 it is not good to take much honey so he who is not looking for honour will be honoured
 he whose spirit is uncontrolled is like an unwalled town which has been broken into
 like snow in summer and rain when the grain is being cut so honour is not natural for the foolish
 as the sparrow in her wandering and the swallow in her flight so the curse does not come without a cause
 a whip for the horse a mouth bit for the ass and a rod for the back of the foolish
 do not give to the foolish man a foolish answer or you will be like him
 give a foolish man a foolish answer or he will seem wise to himself
 he who sends news by the hand of a foolish man is cutting off his feet and drinking in damage
 the legs of one who has no power of walking are hanging loose so is a wise saying in the mouth of the foolish
 giving honour to a foolish man is like attempting to keep a stone fixed in a cord
 like a thorn which goes up into the hand of a man overcome by drink so is a wise saying in the mouth of a foolish man
 like an archer wounding all who go by is a foolish man overcome by drink
 like a dog going back to the food which he has not been able to keep down is the foolish man doing his foolish acts over again
 have you seen a man who seems to himself to be wise there is more hope for the foolish than for him
 the hater of work says there is a lion in the way a lion is in the streets
 a door is turned on its pillar and the hater of work on his bed
 the hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin lifting it again to his mouth is a weariness to him
