 then joshua the son of nun sent two men from shittim secretly with the purpose of searching out the land and jericho so they went and came to the house of a loose woman of the town named rahab where they took their rest for the night
 and it was said to the king of jericho see some men have come here tonight from the children of israel with the purpose of searching out the land
 then the king of jericho sent to rahab saying send out the men who have come to you and are in your house for they have come with the purpose of searching out all the land
 and the woman took the two men and put them in a secret place then she said yes the men came to me but i had no idea where they came from
 and when it was the time for shutting the doors at dark they went out i have no idea where the men went but if you go after them quickly you will overtake them
 but she had taken them up to the roof covering them with the stems of flax which she had put out in order there
 so the men went after them on the road to jordan as far as the river crossing and when they had gone out after them the door into the town was shut
 and before the men went to rest she came up to them on the roof
 and said to them it is clear to me that the lord has given you the land and that the fear of you has come on us
 for we have had news of how the lord made the red sea dry before you when you came out of egypt and what you did to the two kings of the amorites on the other side of jordan to sihon and og whom you gave up to the curse
 and because of this news our hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you for the lord your god is god in heaven on high and here on earth
 so now will you give me your oath by the lord that because i have been kind to you you will be kind to my fathers house
 and that you will keep safe my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and all they have so that death may not come on us
 and the men said to her our life for yours if you keep our business secret and when the lord has given us the land we will keep faith and be kind to you
 then she let them down from the window by a cord for the house where she was living was on the town wall
 and she said to them get away into the hill country or the men who have gone after you will overtake you keep yourselves safe there for three days till the searchers have come back and then go on your way
 and the men said to her we will only be responsible for this oath which you have made us take
 if when we come into the land you put this cord of bright red thread in the window from which you let us down and get your father and mother and your brothers and all your family into the house
 then if anyone goes out of your house into the street his blood will be on his head we will not be responsible but if any damage comes to anyone in the house his blood will be on our heads
 but if you say anything about our business here then we will be free from the oath you have made us take
 and she said let it be as you say then she sent them away and they went and she put the bright red cord in the window
 and they went into the hill country and were there three days till the men who had gone after them had come back and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them
 then the two men came down from the hill country and went over and came back to joshua the son of nun and they gave him a complete account of what had taken place
 and they said to joshua truly the lord has given all the land into our hands and all the people of the land have become like water because of us
 and the lord said to joshua
 say to the children of israel let certain towns be marked out as safe places as i said to you by the mouth of moses
 so that any man who in error and without design has taken the life of another may go in flight to them and they will be safe places for you from him who has the right of punishment for blood
 and if anyone goes in flight to one of those towns and comes into the public place of the town and puts his cause before the responsible men of the town they will take him into the town and give him a place among them where he may be safe
 and if the one who has the right of punishment comes after him they are not to give the taker of life up to him because he was the cause of his neighbours death without designing it and not in hate
 and he is to go on living in that town till he has to come before the meeting of the people to be judged  till the death of him who is high priest at that time  then the taker of life may come back to his town and to his house to the town from which he had gone in flight
