 wisdom is building her house but the foolish woman is pulling it down with her hands

 there is a way which seems straight before a man but its end is the ways of death
 even while laughing the heart may be sad and after joy comes sorrow

 the simple man has faith in every word but the man of good sense gives thought to his footsteps
 the wise man fearing keeps himself from evil but the foolish man goes on in his pride with no thought of danger
