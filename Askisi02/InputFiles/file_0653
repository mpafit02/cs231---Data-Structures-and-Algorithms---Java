 for the fitches are not crushed with a sharp instrument and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cummin but the grain of the fitches is hammered out with a stick and of the cummin with a rod
 is the grain for bread crushed he does not go on crushing it for ever but he lets his cart wheels and his horses go over it without crushing it
 this comes from the lord of armies purposing wonders and wise in all his acts
 ho  ariel ariel the town against which david made war put year to year let the feasts come round
 and i will send trouble on ariel and there will be weeping and cries of grief and she will be to me as ariel
 and i will make war on you like david and you will be shut in by earthworks and i will make towers round you
 and you will be made low and your voice will come out of the earth and your words will be low out of the dust and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit making bird like noises out of the dust
 and the army of your attackers will be like small dust and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind suddenly it will come about
 the lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth shaking and great noise with rushing wind and storm and the flame of burning fire
 and all the nations making war on ariel and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers will be like a dream like a vision of the night
 and it will be like a man desiring food and dreaming that he is feasting but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth or like a man in need of water dreaming that he is drinking but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire so will all the nations be which make war on mount zion
 be surprised and full of wonder let your eyes be covered and be blind be overcome but not with wine go with uncertain steps but not because of strong drink
 for the lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep and by him your eyes the prophets are shut and your heads the seers are covered
 and the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut which men give to one who has knowledge of writing saying make clear to us what is in the book and he says i am not able to for the book is shut
 and they give it to one without learning saying make clear to us what is in the book and he says i have no knowledge of writing
 and the lord said because this people come near to me with their mouths and give honour to me with their lips but their heart is far from me and their fear of me is false a rule given them by the teaching of men
 for this cause i will again do a strange thing among this people a thing to be wondered at and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen
 cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the lord and whose works are in the dark and who say who sees us and who has knowledge of our acts
 you are turning things upside down  is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it will the thing made say of him who made it he made me not or the thing formed say of him who gave it form he has no knowledge
 in a very short time lebanon will become a fertile field and the fertile field will seem like a wood
 and in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark
 and the poor will have their joy in the lord increased and those in need will be glad in the holy one of israel
 for the cruel one has come to nothing and those who make sport of the lord are gone and those who are watching to do evil are cut off
 who give help to a man in a wrong cause and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place taking away a mans right without cause
 for this reason the lord the saviour of abraham says about the family of jacob jacob will not now be put to shame or his face be clouded with fear
 but when they the children of jacob see the work of my hands among them they will give honour to my name yes they will give honour to the holy one of jacob and go in fear of the god of israel
 those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching
 for the lord the lord of armies is about to take away from jerusalem and from judah all their support their store of bread and of water
 the strong man and the man of war the judge and the prophet the man who has knowledge of secret arts and the man who is wise because of his years
 the captain of fifty and the man of high position and the wise guide and the wonder worker and he who makes use of secret powers
