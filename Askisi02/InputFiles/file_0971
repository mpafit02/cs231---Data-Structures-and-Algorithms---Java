 &lta prayer of david&gt let my cause come to your ears o lord give attention to my cry give ear to my prayer which goes not out from false lips
 be my judge for your eyes see what is right
 you have put my heart to the test searching me in the night you have put me to the test and seen no evil purpose in me i will keep my mouth from sin
 as for the works of men by the word of your lips i have kept myself from the ways of the violent
 i have kept my feet in your ways my steps have not been turned away
 my cry has gone up to you for you will give me an answer o god let your ear be turned to me and give attention to my words
 make clear the wonder of your mercy o saviour of those who put their faith in your right hand from those who come out against them
 keep me as the light of your eyes covering me with the shade of your wings
 from the evil doers who are violent to me and from those who are round me desiring my death
 they are shut up in their fat with their mouths they say words of pride
 they have made a circle round our steps their eyes are fixed on us forcing us down to the earth
 like a lion desiring its food and like a young lion waiting in secret places
 up  lord come out against him make him low with your sword be my saviour from the evil doer
 with your hand o lord from men even men of the world whose heritage is in this life and whom you make full with your secret wealth they are full of children after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods
 as for me i will see your face in righteousness when i am awake it will be joy enough for me to see your form
 &ltto the chief music maker of the servant of the lord of david who said the words of this song to the lord on the day when the lord made him free from the hand of all his haters and from the hand of saul and he said&gt i will give you my love o lord my strength
 the lord is my rock my walled town and my saviour my god my rock in him will i put my faith my breastplate and the horn of my salvation and my high tower
 i will send up my cry to the lord who is to be praised so will i be made safe from those who are against me
 the cords of death were round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
 the cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
 in my trouble my voice went up to the lord and my cry to my god my voice came to his hearing in his holy temple and my prayer came before him even into his ears
 then trouble and shock came on the earth and the bases of the mountains were moved and shaking because he was angry
 there went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth flames were lighted by it
 the heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
 and he went in flight through the air seated on a storm cloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
 he made the dark his secret place his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
 before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and fire
 the lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the highest was sounding out a rain of ice and fire
 he sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
 then the deep beds of the waters were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of your words of wrath o lord because of the breath from your mouth
