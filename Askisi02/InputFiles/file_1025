 till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark come my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of bether
 by night on my bed i was looking for him who is the love of my soul i was looking for him but i did not see him
 i will get up now and go about the town in the streets and in the wide ways i will go after him who is the love of my soul i went after him but i did not see him
 the watchmen who go about the town came by me to them i said have you seen him who is my hearts desire
 i was but a little way from them when i came face to face with him who is the love of my soul i took him by the hands and did not let him go till i had taken him into my mothers house and into the room of her who gave me birth
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes of the field let not love be moved till it is ready
 who is this coming out of the waste places like pillars of smoke perfumed with sweet spices with all the spices of the trader
 see it is the bed of solomon sixty men of war are about it of the army of israel
 all of them armed with swords trained in war every man has his sword at his side because of fear in the night
 king solomon made himself a bed of the wood of lebanon
 he made its pillars of silver its base of gold its seat of purple the middle of it of ebony
 go out o daughters of jerusalem and see king solomon with the crown which his mother put on his head on the day when he was married and on the day of the joy of his heart
 see you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of gilead
 your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut which come up from the washing every one has two lambs and there is not one without young
 your red lips are like a bright thread and your mouth is fair of form the sides of your head are like pomegranate fruit under your veil
 your neck is like the tower of david made for a store house of arms in which a thousand breastplates are hanging breastplates for fighting men
 your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth which take their food among the lilies
 till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark i will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense
 you are all fair my love there is no mark on you
 come with me from lebanon my bride with me from lebanon see from the top of amana from the top of senir and hermon from the places of the lions from the mountains of the leopards
 you have taken away my heart my sister my bride you have taken away my heart with one look you have taken it with one chain of your neck 
 how fair is your love my sister  how much better is your love than wine and the smell of your oils than any perfume 
 your lips are dropping honey honey and milk are under your tongue and the smell of your clothing is like the smell of lebanon
 a garden walled in is my sister my bride a garden shut up a spring of water stopped
 the produce of the garden is pomegranates with all the best fruits henna and spikenard
 spikenard and safron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices
 you are a fountain of gardens a spring of living waters and flowing waters from lebanon
 be awake o north wind and come o south blowing on my garden so that its spices may come out let my loved one come into his garden and take of his good fruits
 i have come into my garden my sister my bride to take my myrrh with my spice my wax with my honey my wine with my milk take meat o friends take wine yes be overcome with love
 i am sleeping but my heart is awake it is the sound of my loved one at the door saying be open to me my sister my love my dove my very beautiful one my head is wet with dew and my hair with the drops of the night
