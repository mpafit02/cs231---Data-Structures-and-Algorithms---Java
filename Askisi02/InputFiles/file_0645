 let those who have been forced out of moab have a resting place with you be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land till the cruel ones are cut off and wasting has come to an end and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land
 then a kings seat will be based on mercy and one will be seated on it in the tent of david for ever judging uprightly and quick to do righteousness
 we have had word of the pride of moab how great it is how he is lifted up in pride and passion his high words about himself are false
 for this cause everyone in moab will give cries of grief for moab crushed to the earth they will be weeping for the men of kir hareseth
 for the fields of heshbon are waste the vine of sibmah is dead the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines her vine plants went as far as jazer and came even to the waste land her branches were stretched out to the sea
 for this cause my sorrow for the vine of sibmah will be like the weeping for jazer my eyes are dropping water on you o heshbon and elealeh  for they are sounding the war cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain
 and all joy is gone no longer are they glad for the fertile field and in the vine gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy the crushing of grapes has come to an end and its glad cry has been stopped
 for this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for moab and i am full of sorrow for kir heres
 and when moab goes up to the high place and makes prayer in the house of his god it will have no effect
 this is the word which the lord said about moab in the past
 but now the lord has said in three years the years of a servant working for payment the glory of moab all that great people will be turned to shame and the rest of moab will be very small and without honour
 the word about damascus see they have made damascus a town no longer it has become a waste place
 her towns are unpeopled for ever there the flocks take their rest in peace without fear
 the strong tower has gone from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus the rest of aram will come to destruction and be made like the glory of the children of israel says the lord of armies
 and it will be in that day that the glory of jacob will be made small and the strength of his body will become feeble
 and it will be like a man cutting the growth of his grain pulling together the heads of the grain with his arm even as when they get in the grain in the valley of rephaim
 but it will be like a man shaking an olive tree something will still be there two or three berries on the top of the highest branch four or five on the outside branches of a fertile tree says the lord the god of israel
 in that day a mans heart will be turned to his maker and his eyes to the holy one of israel
 he will not be looking to the altars the work of his hands or to the wood pillars or to the sun images which his fingers have made
 in that day your towns will be like the waste places of the hivites and the amorites which the children of israel took for a heritage and they will come to destruction
 for you have not given honour to the god of your salvation and have not kept in mind the rock of your strength for this cause you made a garden of adonis and put in it the vine cuttings of a strange god
 in the day of your planting you were watching its growth and in the morning your seed was flowering but its fruit is wasted away in the day of grief and bitter sorrow
 ah  the voice of peoples like the loud sounding of the seas and the thundering of great nations rushing on like the bursting out of waters 
 but he will put a stop to them and make them go in flight far away driving them like the waste of the grain on the tops of the mountains before the wind and like the circling dust before the storm
 in the evening there is fear and in the morning they are gone this is the fate of those who take our goods and the reward of those who violently take our property for themselves
 ho  land of the sounding of wings on the other side of the rivers of ethiopia
 which sends its representatives by the sea even in ships of papyrus on the waters go back quickly o representatives to a nation tall and smooth to a people causing fear through all their history a strong nation crushing down its haters whose land is cut through by rivers
 all you peoples of the world and you who are living on the earth when a flag is lifted up on the mountains give attention and when the horn is sounded give ear
 for this is what the lord has said to me i will be quiet watching from my place like the clear heat when the sun is shining like a mist of dew in the heat of summer
 for before the time of getting in the grapes after the opening of the bud when the flower has become a grape ready for crushing he will take away the small branches with knives cutting down and taking away the wide stretching branches
