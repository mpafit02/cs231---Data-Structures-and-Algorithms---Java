 so joshua having come up from gilgal all night made a sudden attack on them
 and the lord made them full of fear before israel and they put great numbers of them to death at gibeon and went after them by the way going up to beth horon driving them back to azekah and makkedah
 and in their flight before israel on the way down from beth horon the lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to azekah causing their death those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of israel put to death with the sword
 it was on the day when the lord gave up the amorites into the hands of the children of israel that joshua said to the lord before the eyes of israel sun be at rest over gibeon and you o moon in the valley of aijalon
 and the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers  is it not recorded in the book of jashar  so the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens and was waiting and did not go down for the space of a day
 and there was no day like that before it or after it when the lord gave ear to the voice of a man for the lord was fighting for israel
 and joshua with all israel went back to the tent circle at gilgal
 but these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at makkedah
 and word was given to joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at makkedah
 and joshua said let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole and let men keep watch by it
 but do you without waiting go after their army attacking them from the back do not let them get into their towns for the lord your god has given them into your hands
 now when joshua and the children of israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns
 all the people went back to joshua to the tent circle at makkedah in peace and no one said a word against the children of israel
 then joshua said take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock and make those five kings come out to me
 and they did so and made those five kings come out of the hole to him the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon
 and when they had made those kings come out to joshua joshua sent for all the men of israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings so they came near and put their feet on their necks
 and joshua said to them have no fear and do not be troubled be strong and take heart for so will the lord do to all against whom you make war
 then joshua had them put to death hanging them on five trees where they were till evening
 and when the sun went down they were taken down from the trees by joshuas orders and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole where they are to this day
 that day joshua took makkedah and put it and its king to the sword every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy and he did to the king of makkedah as he had done to the king of jericho
 then joshua and all israel with him went on from makkedah and came to libnah and made an attack on it
 and again the lord gave it and its king into the hands of israel and he put it and every person in it to the sword till their destruction was complete and he did to its king as he had done to the king of jericho
 then joshua and all israel with him went on from libnah to lachish and took up their position against it and made an attack on it
 and the lord gave lachish into the hands of israel and on the second day he took it putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy as he had done to libnah
 then horam king of gezer came up to the help of lachish and joshua overcame him and his people putting all of them to death
 and joshua and all israel with him went on from lachish to eglon and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it
 and that day they took it putting it and every person in it to the sword as he had done to lachish
 and joshua and all israel with him went up from eglon to hebron and made an attack on it
 and took it overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword as he had done to eglon he put them all to death and gave it up to the curse with every person in it
 and joshua and all israel with him went on to make an attack on debir
