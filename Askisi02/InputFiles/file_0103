 and again ships though they are so great and are moved by violent winds are turned by a very small guiding blade at the impulse of the man who is using it
 even so the tongue is a small part of the body but it takes credit for great things how much wood may be lighted by a very little fire 
 and the tongue is a fire it is the power of evil placed in our bodies making all the body unclean putting the wheel of life on fire and getting its fire from hell
 for every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority
 but the tongue may not be controlled by man it is an unresting evil it is full of the poison of death
 with it we give praise to our lord and father and with it we put a curse on men who are made in gods image
 out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing my brothers it is not right for these things to be so
 does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water
 is a fig tree able to give us olives my brothers or do we get figs from a vine or sweet water from the salt sea
 who has wisdom and good sense among you let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom
 but if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others have no pride in this talking falsely against what is true
 this wisdom is not from heaven but is of the earth and the flesh and the evil one
 for where envy is and the desire to get the better of others there is no order but every sort of evil doing
 but the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy then gentle readily giving way in argument full of peace and mercy and good works not doubting not seeming other than it is
 and the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace
 what is the cause of wars and fighting among you is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies
 you are burning with desire and have not your desire so you put men to death you are full of envy and you are not able to get your desire so you are fighting and making war you have not your desire because you do not make request for it
 you make your request but you do not get it because your request has been wrongly made desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure
 o you who are false to god do you not see that the friends of this world are not gods friends every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of god
 or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy writings say the spirit which god put into our hearts has a strong desire for us
 but he gives more grace so that the writings say god is against the men of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him
 for this cause be ruled by god but make war on the evil one and he will be put to flight before you
 come near to god and he will come near to you make your hands clean you evil doers put away deceit from your hearts you false in mind
 be troubled with sorrow and weeping let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief
 make yourselves low in the eyes of the lord and you will be lifted up by him
 do not say evil against one another my brothers he who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brothers judge says evil against the law and is judging the law and in judging the law you become not a doer of the law but a judge
 there is only one judge and law giver even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction but who are you to be your neighbours judge
 how foolish it is to say today or tomorrow we will go into this town and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth
 when you are not certain what will take place tomorrow what is your life it is a mist which is seen for a little time and then is gone
 but the right thing to say would be if it is the lords pleasure and if we are still living we will do this and that
