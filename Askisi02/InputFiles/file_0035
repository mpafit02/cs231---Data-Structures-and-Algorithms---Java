 and i said this very thing in my letter for fear that when i came i might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy being certain of this that my joy is the joy of you all
 for out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping i sent my letter to you not to give you sorrow but so that you might see how great is the love which i have to you
 but if anyone has been a cause of sorrow he has been so not to me only but in some measure to all of you  i say this that i may not be over hard on you 
 let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him
 so that now on the other hand it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you for fear that his sorrow may be over great
 for which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts
 and for the same reason i sent you a letter so that i might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things
 but if you give forgiveness to anyone i do the same for if i have given forgiveness for anything i have done it because of you in the person of christ
 so that satan may not get the better of us for we are not without knowledge of his designs
 now when i came to troas for the good news of christ and there was an open door for me in the lord
 i had no rest in my spirit because titus my brother was not there so i went away from them and came into macedonia
 but praise be to god who makes us strong to overcome in christ and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him
 for we are a sweet perfume of christ to god in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction
 to the one it is a perfume of death to death to the other a perfume of life to life and who is enough for such things
 for we are not like the great number who make use of the word of god for profit but our words are true as from god being said as before god in christ
 do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right or have we need as some have of letters of approval to you or from you
 you yourselves are our letter whose writing is in our heart open for every mans reading and knowledge
 for you are clearly a letter of christ the fruit of our work recorded not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in stone but in hearts of flesh
 and this is the certain faith which we have in god through christ
 not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit but our power comes from god
 who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter gives death but the spirit gives life
 for if the operation of the law giving death recorded in letters on stone came with glory so that the eyes of the children of israel had to be turned away from the face of moses because of its glory a glory which was only for a time
 will not the operation of the spirit have a much greater glory
 for if the operation of the law producing punishment had its glory how much greater will be the operation of the spirit causing righteousness
 for the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory because of the greater glory of that which comes after
 for if the order which was for a time had its glory much more will the eternal order have its glory
 having then such a hope we keep nothing back
 and are not like moses who put a veil on his face so that the children of israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things
 but their minds were made hard for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted though it is taken away in christ
 but to this day at the reading of the law of moses a veil is over their heart
