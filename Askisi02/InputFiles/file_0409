 but if you go back to the town and say to absalom i will be your servant o king as in the past i have been your fathers servant so now i will be yours then you will be able to keep ahithophels designs against me from being put into effect
 and have you not there zadok and abiathar the priests so whatever comes to your ears from the kings house give word of it to zadok and abiathar the priests
 see they have with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan the son of abiathar by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears
 so hushai davids friend went into the town and absalom came to jerusalem
 and when david had gone a little way past the top of the slope ziba the servant of mephibosheth came to him with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hundred stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine
 and david said to ziba what is your reason for this and ziba said the asses are for the use of the kings people and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land
 and the king said and where is your masters son and ziba said he is still at jerusalem for he said today israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father
 then the king said to ziba truly everything which was mephibosheths is yours and ziba said i give honour to my lord may i have grace in your eyes my lord o king 
 and when king david came to bahurim a man of sauls family named shimei the son of gera came out from there calling curses after him
 and he sent stones at david and at all the kings servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side on the right hand and on the left
 and shimei said with curses be gone be gone you man of blood you good for nothing
 the lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of saul whose kingdom you have taken and the lord has given the kingdom to absalom your son now you yourself are taken in your evil because you are a man of blood
 then abishai the son of zeruiah said to the king is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king let me go over and take off his head
 and the king said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah let him go on cursing for the lord has said put a curse on david and who then may say why have you done so
 and david said to abishai and to all his servants you see how my son the offspring of my body has made designs against my life how much more then may this benjamite do so let him be and let him go on cursing for the lord has given him orders
 it may be that the lord will take note of my wrongs and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today
 so david and his men went on their way and shimei went by the hillside parallel with them cursing and sending stones and dust at him
 and the king and his people came tired to jordan and took their rest there
 and absalom and the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel was with him
 then hushai the archite davids friend came to absalom and said long life to the king long life to the king 
 and absalom said is this your love for your friend why did you not go with your friend
 and hushai said to absalom not so i am for that man whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel have taken as king and i will take my place with him
 and more than this  where is my place as a servant is it not before his son as i have been your fathers servant so will i be yours
 then absalom said to ahithophel give your opinion now what are we to do
 and ahithophel said to absalom go in to your fathers women who are here looking after his house then all israel will have the news that you are hated by your father and the hands of your supporters will be strong
 so they put up the tent for absalom on the top of the house and absalom went in to his fathers women before the eyes of all israel
 in those days the opinions of ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from god so were they valued by david as much as by absalom
 then ahithophel said to absalom let me take out twelve thousand men and this very night i will go after david
 and i will come up with him when he is tired and feeble and make him full of fear and all the people with him will go in flight and i will make an attack on the king only
 and i will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her husband it is the life of only one man you are going after so all the people will be at peace
