 come out from among this people so that i may send sudden destruction on them and they went down on their faces
 and moses said to aaron take your vessel and put in it fire from the altar and sweet spices and take it quickly into the meeting of the people and make them free from sin for wrath has gone out from the lord and the disease is starting
 and at the words of moses aaron took his vessel and went running among the people and even then the disease had made a start among them and he put spices in his vessel to take away the sin of the people
 and he took his place between the dead and the living and the disease was stopped
 now fourteen thousand seven hundred deaths were caused by that disease in addition to those who came to their end because of what korah had done
 then aaron went back to moses to the door of the tent of meeting and the disease came to a stop
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that they are to give you rods one for every family for every chief the head of his fathers house making twelve rods let every mans name be placed on his rod
 and let aarons name be placed on the rod of levi for there is to be one rod for the head of every family
 and let them be stored up in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of witness where i come to you
 and the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it so i will put a stop to the outcries which the children of israel make to me against you
 so moses gave these orders to the children of israel and all their chiefs gave him rods one for the head of every family making twelve rods and aarons rod was among them
 and moses put the rods before the lord in the tent of witness
 now on the day after moses went into the tent of witness and he saw that aarons rod the rod of the house of levi had put out buds and was covered with buds and flowers and fruit
 then moses took out all the rods from before the lord and gave them back to the children of israel and they saw them and every man took his rod
 and the lord said to moses put aarons rod back in front of the ark of witness to be kept for a sign against this false hearted people so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me and death may not overtake them
 this moses did as the lord gave orders so he did
 and the children of israel said to moses truly destruction has come on us an evil fate has overtaken us all
 death will overtake everyone who comes near who comes near the house of the lord are we all to come to destruction
 and the lord said to aaron you and your sons and your fathers family are to be responsible for all wrongdoing in relation to the holy place and you and your sons are to be responsible for the errors which come about in your work as priests
 let your brothers the family of levi come near with you so that they may be joined with you and be your servants but you and your sons with you are to go in before the ark of witness
 they are to do your orders and be responsible for the work of the tent but they may not come near the vessels of the holy place or the altar so that death may not overtake them or you
 they are to be joined with you in the care of the tent of meeting doing whatever is needed for the tent and no one of any other family may come near you
 you are to be responsible for the holy place and the altar so that wrath may never again come on the children of israel
 now see i have taken your brothers the levites from among the children of israel they are given to you and to the lord to do the work of the tent of meeting
 and you and your sons with you are to be responsible as priests for the altar and everything on it and everything inside the veil you are to do the work of priests i have given you your position as priests and any other man who comes near will be put to death
 and the lord said to aaron see i have given into your care my lifted offerings even all the holy things of the children of israel i have given to you and to your sons as your right for ever because you have been marked with the holy oil
 this is to be yours of the most holy things out of the fire offerings every offering of theirs every meal offering and sin offering and every offering which they make on account of error is to be most holy for you and your sons
 as most holy things they are to be your food let every male have them for food it is to be holy to you
 and this is yours the lifted offering which they give and all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as your right for ever everyone in your house who is clean may have them for food
