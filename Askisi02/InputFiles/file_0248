 you will say branches were broken off so that i might be put in
 truly because they had no faith they were broken off and you have your place by reason of your faith do not be lifted up in pride but have fear
 for if god did not have mercy on the natural branches he will not have mercy on you
 see then that god is good but his rules are fixed to those who were put away he was hard but to you he has been good on the condition that you keep in his mercy if not you will be cut off as they were
 and they if they do not go on without faith will be united to the tree again because god is able to put them in again
 for if you were cut out of a field olive tree and against the natural use were united to a good olive tree how much more will these the natural branches be united again with the olive tree which was theirs
 for it is my desire brothers that this secret may be clear to you so that you may not have pride in your knowledge that israel has been made hard in part till all the gentiles have come in
 and so all israel will get salvation as it is said in the holy writings there will come out of zion the one who makes free by him wrongdoing will be taken away from jacob
 and this is my agreement with them when i will take away their sins
 as far as the good news is in question they are cut off from god on account of you but as far as the selection is in question they are loved on account of the fathers
 because gods selection and his mercies may not be changed
 for as you in time past were not under the rule of god but now have got mercy through their turning away
 so in the same way these have gone against the orders of god so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy
 for god has let them all go against his orders so that he might have mercy on them all
 o how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of god  no one is able to make discovery of his decisions and his ways may not be searched out
 who has knowledge of the mind of the lord or who has taken part in his purposes
 or who has first given to him and it will be given back to him again
 for of him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory for ever so be it
 for this reason i make request to you brothers by the mercies of god that you will give your bodies as a living offering holy pleasing to god which is the worship it is right for you to give him
 and let not your behaviour be like that of this world but be changed and made new in mind so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of god
 but i say to every one of you through the grace given to me not to have an over high opinion of himself but to have wise thoughts as god has given to every one a measure of faith
 for as we have a number of parts in one body but all the parts have not the same use
 so we though we are a number of persons are one body in christ and are dependent on one another
 and having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us such as the quality of a prophet let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith
 or the position of a deacon of the church let a man give himself to it or he who has the power of teaching let him make use of it
 he who has the power of comforting let him do so he who gives let him give freely he who has the power of ruling let him do it with a serious mind he who has mercy on others let it be with joy
 let love be without deceit be haters of what is evil keep your minds fixed on what is good
 be kind to one another with a brothers love putting others before yourselves in honour
 be not slow in your work but be quick in spirit as the lords servants
 being glad in hope quiet in trouble at all times given to prayer
