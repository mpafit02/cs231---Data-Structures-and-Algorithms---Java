 by the blessing of the upright man the town is made great but it is overturned by the mouth of the evil doer
 he who has a poor opinion of his neighbour has no sense but a wise man keeps quiet
 he who goes about talking of others makes secrets public but the true hearted man keeps things covered
 when there is no helping suggestion the people will have a fall but with a number of wise guides they will be safe
 he who makes himself responsible for a strange man will undergo much loss but the hater of such undertakings will be safe
 a woman who is full of grace is honoured but a woman hating righteousness is a seat of shame those hating work will undergo loss but the strong keep their wealth
 the man who has mercy will be rewarded but the cruel man is the cause of trouble to himself
 the sinner gets the payment of deceit but his reward is certain who puts in the seed of righteousness
 so righteousness gives life but he who goes after evil gets death for himself
 the uncontrolled are hated by the lord but those whose ways are without error are his delight
 certainly the evil doer will not go free from punishment but the seed of the upright man will be safe
 like a ring of gold in the nose of a pig is a beautiful woman who has no sense
 the desire of the upright man is only for good but wrath is waiting for the evil doer
 a man may give freely and still his wealth will be increased and another may keep back more than is right but only comes to be in need
 he who gives blessing will be made fat but the curser will himself be cursed
 he who keeps back grain will be cursed by the people but a blessing will be on the head of him who lets them have it for a price
 he who with all his heart goes after what is good is searching for grace but he who is looking for trouble will get it
 he who puts his faith in wealth will come to nothing but the upright man will be full of growth like the green leaf
 the troubler of his house will have the wind for his heritage and the foolish will be servant to the wise hearted
 the fruit of righteousness is a tree of life but violent behaviour takes away souls
 if the upright man is rewarded on earth how much more the evil doer and the sinner 
 a lover of training is a lover of knowledge but a hater of teaching is like a beast
 a good man has grace in the eyes of the lord but the man of evil designs gets punishment from him
 no man will make himself safe through evil doing but the root of upright men will never be moved
 a woman of virtue is a crown to her husband but she whose behaviour is a cause of shame is like a wasting disease in his bones
 the purposes of upright men are right but the designs of evil doers are deceit
 the words of sinners are destruction for the upright but the mouth of upright men is their salvation
 evil doers are overturned and never seen again but the house of upright men will keep its place
 a man will be praised in the measure of his wisdom but a wrong minded man will be looked down on
 he who is of low position and has a servant is better than one who has a high opinion of himself and is in need of bread
