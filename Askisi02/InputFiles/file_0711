 how long will i go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war horn
 for my people are foolish they have no knowledge of me they are evil minded children without sense all of them they are wise in evil doing but have no knowledge of doing good
 looking at the earth i saw that it was waste and without form and to the heavens that they had no light
 looking at the mountains i saw them shaking and all the hills were moved about
 looking i saw that there was no man and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight
 looking i saw that the fertile field was a waste and all its towns were broken down before the lord and before his burning wrath
 for this is what the lord has said all the land will become a waste i will make destruction complete
 the earth will be weeping for this and the heavens on high will be black because i have said it and i will not go back from it it is my purpose and it will not be changed
 all the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks every town has been given up not a man is living in them
 and you when you are made waste what will you do though you are clothed in red though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold though you make your eyes wide with paint it is for nothing that you make yourself fair your lovers have no more desire for you they have designs on your life
 a voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth pains the pain of one giving birth to her first child the voice of the daughter of zion fighting for breath stretching out her hands saying now sorrow is mine  for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord after nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had let him go from ramah when he had taken him for he had been put in chains among all the prisoners of jerusalem and judah who were taken away prisoners to babylon
 and the captain of the armed men took jeremiah and said to him the lord your god gave word of the evil which was to come on this place
 *** and the lord has made it come and has done as he said because of your sin against the lord in not giving ear to his voice and that is why this thing has come on you
 now see this day i am freeing you from the chains which are on your hands if it seems good to you to come with me to babylon then come and i will keep an eye on you but if it does not seem good to you to come with me to babylon then do not come see all the land is before you if it seems good and right to you to go on living in the land
 then go back to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon has made ruler over the towns of judah and make your living place with him among the people or go wherever it seems right to you to go so the captain of the armed men gave him food and some money and let him go
 so jeremiah went to gedaliah the son of ahikam in mizpah and was living with him among the people who were still in the land
 now when it came to the ears of all the captains of the forces who were in the field and their men that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam ruler in the land and had put under his care the men and women and children all the poorest of the land those who had not been taken away to babylon
 then they came to gedaliah in mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men
 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan took an oath to them and their men saying have no fear of the servants of the chaldaeans go on living in the land and become the servants of the king of babylon and all will be well
 as for me i will be living in mizpah as your representative before the chaldaeans who come to us but you are to get in your wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and make living places for yourselves in the towns which you have taken
 in the same way when all the jews who were in moab and among the children of ammon and in edom and in all the countries had news that the king of babylon had let judah keep some of its people and that he had put over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
 then all the jews came back from all the places to which they had gone in flight and came to the land of judah to gedaliah to mizpah and got in a great store of wine and summer fruit
 now johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were in the field came to gedaliah in mizpah
 and said to him has it come to your knowledge that baalis the king of the children of ammon has sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to take your life but gedaliah the son of ahikam put no faith in what they said
 then johanan the son of kareah said to gedaliah in mizpah secretly let me now go and put ishmael the son of nethaniah to death without anyones knowledge why let him take your life so that all the jews who have come together to you may be sent in flight and the rest of the men of judah come to an end
 but gedaliah the son of ahikam said to johanan the son of kareah you are not to do this for what you say about ishmael is false
 now it came about in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the kings seed having with him ten men came to gedaliah the son of ahikam in mizpah and they had a meal together in mizpah
 then ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and attacking gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword put to death him whom the king of babylon had made ruler over the land
 and ishmael put to death all the jews who were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldaean men of war
