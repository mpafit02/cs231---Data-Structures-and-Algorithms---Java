 so that it became clear through all the praetorium and to all the rest that i was a prisoner on account of christ
 and most of the brothers in the lord taking heart because of my chains are all the stronger to give the word of god without fear
 though some are preaching christ out of envy and competition others do it out of a good heart
 these do it from love conscious that i am responsible for the cause of the good news
 but those are preaching christ in a spirit of competition not from their hearts but with the purpose of giving me pain in my prison
 what then only that in every way falsely or truly the preaching of christ goes on and in this i am glad and will be glad
 for i am conscious that this will be for my salvation through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the spirit of jesus christ
 in the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will i be put to shame but that without fear as at all times so now will christ have glory in my body by life or by death
 for to me life is christ and death is profit
 but if i go on living in the flesh  if this is the fruit of my work  then i do not see what decision to make
 i am in a hard position between the two having a desire to go away and be with christ which is very much better
 still to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you
 and being certain of this i am conscious that i will go on yes and go on with you all for your growth and joy in the faith
 so that your pride in me may be increased in christ jesus through my being present with you again
 only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of christ so that if i come and see you or if i am away from you i may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit working together with one soul for the faith of the good news
 having no fear of those who are against you which is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation and that from god
 because to you it has been given in the cause of christ not only to have faith in him but to undergo pain on his account
 fighting the same fight which you saw in me and now have word of in me
 if then there is any comfort in christ any help given by love any uniting of hearts in the spirit any loving mercies and pity
 make my joy complete by being of the same mind having the same love being in harmony and of one mind
 doing nothing through envy or through pride but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself
 not looking everyone to his private good but keeping in mind the things of others
 let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus
 to whom though himself in the form of god it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like god
 but he made himself as nothing taking the form of a servant being made like men
 and being seen in form as a man he took the lowest place and let himself be put to death even the death of the cross
 for this reason god has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name
 so that at the name of jesus every knee may be bent of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld
 and that every tongue may give witness that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
 so then my loved ones as you have at all times done what i say not only when i am present but now much more when i am not with you give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts
