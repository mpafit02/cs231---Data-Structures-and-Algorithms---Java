 then he said put away the strange gods among you turning your hearts to the lord the god of israel
 and the people said to joshua we will be the servants of the lord our god and we will give ear to his voice
 so joshua made an agreement with the people that day and gave them a rule and a law in shechem
 and joshua put these words on record writing them in the book of the law of god and he took a great stone and put it up there under the oak tree which was in the holy place of the lord
 and joshua said to all the people see now this stone is to be a witness against us for all the words of the lord have been said to us in its hearing so it will be a witness against you if you are false to the lord your god
 then joshua let the people go away every man to his heritage
 now after these things the death of joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord took place he being then a hundred and ten years old
 and they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in timnath serah in the hill country of ephraim to the north of mount gaash
 and israel was true to the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the older men who were still living after joshuas death and had seen what the lord had done for israel
 and the bones of joseph which the children of israel had taken up from egypt they put in the earth in shechem in the property which jacob had got from the sons of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred shekels and they became the heritage of the children of joseph
 then the death of eleazar the son of aaron took place and his body was put in the earth in the hill of phinehas his son which had been given to him in the hill country of ephraim
 then joshua got up early in the morning and moving on from shittim he and all the children of israel came to jordan and were there for the night before going over
 and at the end of three days the men in authority over the people went through the tents
 giving the people their orders and saying when you see the ark of the agreement of the lord your god lifted up by the priests the levites then get up from your places and go after it
 but let there be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits come no nearer to it so that you may see the way you have to go for you have not been over this way before
 and joshua said to the people make yourselves holy for tomorrow the lord will do works of wonder among you
 then joshua said to the priests take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people so they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people
 and the lord said to joshua from now on i will give you glory in the eyes of all israel so that they may see that as i was with moses so i will be with you
 and you are to give orders to the priests who take up the ark of the agreement and say when you come to the edge of the waters of jordan go no further
 and joshua said to the children of israel come to me here and give ear to the words of the lord your god
 and joshua said by this you will see that the living god is among you and that he will certainly send out from before you the canaanite and the hittite and the hivite and the perizzite and the girgashite and the amorite and the jebusite
 see the ark of the agreement of the lord of all the earth is going over before you into jordan
 so take twelve men out of the tribes of israel a man from every tribe
 and when the feet of the priests who take up the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth come to rest in the waters of jordan the waters of jordan will be cut off all the waters flowing down from higher up and will come together in a mass
 so when the people went out from their tents to go over jordan the priests who took up the ark of the agreement were in front of the people
 and when those who took up the ark came to jordan and the feet of the priests who took up the ark were touching the edge of the water  for the waters of jordan are overflowing all through the time of the grain cutting 
 then the waters flowing down from higher up were stopped and came together in a mass a long way back at adam a town near zarethan and the waters flowing down to the sea of the arabah the salt sea were cut off and the people went across opposite jericho
 and the priests who took up the ark of the agreement of the lord kept their places with their feet on dry land in the middle of jordan while all israel went over on dry land till all the nation had gone over jordan
 now when all the nation had come to the other side of jordan the lord said to joshua
 take twelve men from the people a man for every tribe
