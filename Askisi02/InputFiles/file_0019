 and let these first be put to the test then let them become deacons if there is nothing against them
 women are to be serious in behaviour saying no evil of others controlling themselves true in all things
 let deacons be husbands of one wife ruling their children and their houses well
 for those who have done good work as deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in christ jesus
 i am writing these things to you though i am hoping to come to you before long
 but if i am long in coming this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and base of what is true
 and without argument great is the secret of religion he who was seen in the flesh who was given gods approval in the spirit was seen by the angels of whom the good news was given among the nations in whom the world had faith who was taken up in glory
 but the spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith giving their minds to spirits of deceit and the teachings of evil spirits
 through the false ways of men whose words are untrue whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron
 who keep men from being married and from taking food which god made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge
 because everything which god has made is good and nothing is evil if it is taken with praise
 for it is made holy by the word of god and by prayer
 if you keep these things before the minds of the brothers you will be a good servant of christ jesus trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide
 but have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories give yourself training in religion
 for the training of the body is of profit for a little but religion is of profit in every way giving hope for the life which now is and for that which is to come
 this is a true saying in which all may put their faith
 and this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting because our hope is in the living god who is the saviour of all men and specially of those who have faith
 let these be your orders and your teaching
 let no one make little of you because you are young but be an example to the church in word in behaviour in love in faith in holy living
 till i come give attention to the reading of the holy writings to comforting the saints and to teaching
 make use of that grace in you which was given to you by the word of the prophets when the rulers of the church put their hands on you
 have a care for these things give yourself to them with all your heart so that all may see how you go forward
 give attention to yourself and your teaching go on in these things for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you
 do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church but let your talk be as to a father and to the younger men as to brothers
 to the older women as to mothers to the younger as to sisters with a clean heart
 give honour to widows who are truly widows
 but if any widow has children or childrens children let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers for this is pleasing in the eyes of god
 now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in god giving herself to prayer day and night
 but she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living
 give orders to this effect so that no evil may be said of anyone
