 now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war joab went out at the head of the armed forces and made waste all the land of the ammonites and put his men in position before rabbah shutting it in but david was still at jerusalem and joab took rabbah and made it waste
 and david took the crown of milcom from off his head its weight was a talent of gold and it had stones of great price in it and it was put on davids head and he took a great store of goods from the town
 and he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood cutting instruments and iron grain crushers and axes and this he did to all the towns of the children of ammon then david and all the people went back to jerusalem
 now after this there was war with the philistines at gezer then sibbecai the hushathite put to death sippai one of the offspring of the rephaim and they were overcome
 and again there was war with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair put to death lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite the stem of whose spear was like a cloth workers rod
 and again there was war at gath where there was a very tall man who had twenty four fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the rephaim
 and when he put shame on israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother put him to death
 these were of the offspring of the rephaim in gath they came to their death by the hands of david and his servants
 now satan designing evil against israel put into davids mind the impulse to take the number of israel
 and david said to joab and the captains of the people now let all israel from beer sheba to dan be numbered and give me word so that i may be certain of their number
 and joab said may the lord make his people a hundred times more in number than they are but my lord king are they not all my lords servants why would my lord have this done why will he become a cause of sin to israel
 but the kings word was stronger than joabs so joab went out and went through all israel and came to jerusalem
