 i have been teaching you laws and decisions as i was ordered to do by the lord my god so that you might keep them in the land to which you are going to take it for your heritage
 so keep these laws and do them for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples who hearing all these laws will say truly this great nation is a wise and far seeing people
 for what great nation has a god so near to them as the lord our god is whenever we are turned to him in prayer
 and what great nation has laws and decisions so right as all this law which i put before you today
 only take care and keep watch on your soul for fear that the things which your eyes have seen go from your memory and from your heart all the days of your life but let the knowledge of them be given to your children and to your childrens children
 that day when you were waiting before the lord your god in horeb and the lord said to me make all the people come together so that hearing my words they may go in fear of me all the days of their life on earth and give this teaching to their children
 and you came near waiting at the foot of the mountain and flames of fire went up from the mountain to the heart of heaven with dark clouds and all was black as night
 and the voice of the lord came to you out of the fire the sound of his words came to your ears but you saw no form there was nothing but a voice
 and he gave you his agreement with you the ten rules which you were to keep which he put in writing on the two stones of the law
 and the lord gave me orders at that time to make clear to you these laws and decisions so that you might do them in the land to which you are going and which is to be your heritage
 so keep watch on yourselves with care for you saw no form of any sort on the day when the voice of the lord came to you in horeb out of the heart of the fire
 so that you may not be turned to evil ways and make for yourselves an image in the form of any living thing male or female
 or any beast of the earth or winged bird of the air
 or of anything which goes flat on the earth or any fish in the water under the earth
 and when your eyes are lifted up to heaven and you see the sun and the moon and the stars all the army of heaven do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship or become the servants of what the lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven
 but the lord has taken you out of the flaming fire out of egypt to be to him the people of his heritage as you are today
 and the lord was angry with me because of you and made an oath that i was not to go over jordan into the good land which the lord is giving you for your heritage
 but death is to come to me in this land i may not go over jordan but you will go over and take that good land for your heritage
 take care that you do not let the agreement of the lord your god which he has made with you go out of your mind or make for yourselves images of any sort against the orders which the lord your god has given you
 for the lord your god is an all burning fire and he will not let the honour which is his be given to any other
 if when you have had children and childrens children and have been living a long time in the land you are turned to evil ways and make an image of any sort and do evil in the eyes of the lord your god moving him to wrath
 may heaven and earth be my witnesses against you today that destruction will quickly overtake you cutting you off from that land which you are going over jordan to take your days will not be long in that land but you will come to a complete end
 and the lord will send you wandering among the peoples only a small band of you will be kept from death among the nations where the lord will send you
 there you will be the servants of gods made by mens hands of wood and stone having no power of seeing or hearing or taking food or smelling
 but if in those lands you are turned again to the lord your god searching for him with all your heart and soul he will not keep himself from you
 when you are in trouble and all these things have come on you if in the future you are turned again to the lord your god and give ear to his voice
 because the lord your god is a god of mercy he will not take away his help from you or let destruction overtake you or be false to the agreement which he made by an oath with your fathers
 give thought now to the days which are past before your time from the day when god first gave life to man on the earth and searching from one end of heaven to the other see if such a great thing as this has ever been or if anything like it has been talked of in story
 has any people ever gone on living after hearing the voice of god out of the heart of the fire as you did
 has god ever before taken a nation for himself from out of another nation by punishments and signs and wonders by war and by a strong hand and a stretched out arm and great acts of wonder and fear as the lord your god did for you in egypt before your very eyes
