 and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brothers and their sons twenty
 and of the nethinim to whom david and the captains had given the work of helping the levites two hundred and twenty nethinim all of them specially named
 then i gave orders for a time of going without food there by the river ahava so that we might make ourselves low before our god in prayer requesting from him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance
 for i would not for shame make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might make attacks on us on the way for we had said to the king the hand of our god is on his servants for good but his power and his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him
 so we went without food requesting our god for this and his ear was open to our prayer
 so i put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brothers with them
 and gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels all the offering for the house of our god which the king and his wise men and his captains and all israel there present had given
 measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels a hundred talents weight and a hundred talents of gold
 and twenty gold basins of a thousand darics and two vessels of the best bright brass equal in value to gold
 and i said to them you are holy to the lord and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are an offering freely given to the lord the god of your fathers
 take care of them and keep them till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the levites and the chiefs of the families of israel in jerusalem in the rooms of the house of the lord
 so the priests and the levites took the weight of silver and gold and the vessels to take them to jerusalem into the house of our god
 then we went away from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to jerusalem and the hand of our god was on us and he gave us salvation from our haters and those who were waiting to make an attack on us by the way
 and we came to jerusalem and were there for three days
 and on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our god into the hands of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them were jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui the levites
 all was handed over by number and by weight and the weight was put on record at that time
 and those who had been prisoners who had come back from a strange land made burned offerings to the god of israel twelve oxen for all israel ninety six male sheep seventy seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burned offering to the lord
 and they gave the kings orders to the kings captains and the rulers across the river and they gave the people and the house of god the help which was needed
 now after these things were done the captains came to me and said the people of israel and the priests and levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands but have taken part in the disgusting ways of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites
 for they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed has been mixed with the peoples of the lands and in fact the captains and rulers have been the first to do this evil
 and hearing this with signs of grief and pulling out the hair of my head and my chin i took my seat on the earth deeply troubled
 then everyone who went in fear of the words of the god of israel because of the sin of those who had come back came together to me and i kept where i was overcome with grief till the evening offering
 and at the evening offering having made myself low before god i got up and with signs of grief falling down on my knees with my hands stretched out to the lord my god
 i said o my god shame keeps me from lifting up my face to you my god for our sins are increased higher than our heads and our evil doing has come up to heaven
 from the days of our fathers till this day we have been great sinners and for our sins we and our kings and our priests have been given up into the hands of the kings of the lands to the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face as it is this day
 and now for a little time grace has come to us from the lord our god to let a small band of us get free and to give us a nail in his holy place so that our god may give light to our eyes and a measure of new life in our prison chains
 for we are servants but our god has not been turned away from us in our prison but has had mercy on us before the eyes of the kings of persia to give us new strength to put up again the house of our god and to make fair its waste places and to give us a wall in judah and jerusalem
 and now o our god what are we to say after this for we have not kept your laws
 which you gave to your servants the prophets saying the land into which you are going to take it for a heritage is an unclean land because of the evil lives of the peoples of the land and their disgusting ways which have made the land unclean from end to end
 so now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for their peace or well being for ever so that you may be strong living on the good of the land and handing it on to your children for a heritage for ever
