 and the lord took me from the flock and the lord said to me go be a prophet to my people israel
 now then give ear to the word of the lord you say be no prophet to israel and say not a word against the people of isaac
 so this is what the lord has said your wife will be a loose woman in the town and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword and your land will be cut up into parts by a line and you yourself will come to your end in an unclean land and israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land
 this is what the lord god let me see and i saw a basket of summer fruit
 and he said amos what do you see and i said a basket of summer fruit then the lord said to me the end has come to my people israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
 and the songs of the kings house will be cries of pain in that day says the lord god great will be the number of the dead bodies and everywhere they will put them out without a word
 give ear to this you who are crushing the poor and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land
 saying when will the new moon be gone so that we may do trade in grain and the sabbath so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields making the measure small and the price great and trading falsely with scales of deceit
 getting the poor for silver and him who is in need for the price of two shoes and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain
 the lord has taken an oath by the pride of jacob truly i will ever keep in mind all their works
 will not the land be shaking with fear because of this and everyone in it have sorrow and all of it will be overflowing like the river and it will be troubled and go down again like the river of egypt
 and it will come about in that day says the lord god that i will make the sun go down in the middle of the day and i will make the earth dark in daylight
 your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief everyone will be clothed with haircloth and the hair of every head will be cut i will make the weeping like that for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day
 see the days are coming says the lord god when i will send times of great need on the land not need of food or desire for water but for hearing the words of the lord
 and they will go wandering from sea to sea and from the north even to the east running here and there in search of the word of the lord and they will not get it
 in that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water
 those who make their oaths by the sin of samaria and say by the life of your god o dan and by the living way of beer sheba even they will go down never again to be lifted up
 i saw the lord stationed by the side of the altar giving blows to the tops of the pillars so that the doorsteps were shaking and he said i will let all of them be broken with earth shocks i will put the last of them to the sword if any one of them goes in flight he will not get away not one of them will be safe
 even if they go deep into the underworld my hand will take them up from there if they go up to heaven i will get them down
 though they take cover on the top of carmel i will go in search of them and get them out though they keep themselves from my eyes in the bed of the sea i will give orders to the great snake there and he will give them a bite
 and though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers even there will i give orders to the sword to put them to death my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good
 for the lord the god of armies is he at whose touch the land is turned to water and everyone in it will be given up to sorrow all of it will be overflowing like the river and will go down again like the river of egypt
 it is he who makes his rooms in the heaven basing his arch on the earth whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea and sends them flowing over the face of the earth the lord is his name
 are you not as the children of the ethiopians to me o children of israel says the lord have i not taken israel up out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the aramaeans from kir
 see the eyes of the lord are on the evil kingdom and i will put an end to it in all the earth but i will not send complete destruction on jacob says the lord
 for see i will give orders and i will have israel moved about among all the nations as grain is moved about by the shaking of the tray but not the smallest seed will be dropped on the earth
 all those sinners among my people will be put to the sword who say evil will not overtake us or come face to face with us
 in that day i will put up the tent of david which has come down and make good its broken places and i will put up again his damaged walls building it up as in the past
 so that the rest of edom may be their heritage and all the nations who have been named by my name says the lord who is doing this
 see the days will come says the lord when the ploughman will overtake him who is cutting the grain and the crusher of the grapes him who is planting seed and sweet wine will be dropping from the mountains and the hills will be turned into streams of wine
