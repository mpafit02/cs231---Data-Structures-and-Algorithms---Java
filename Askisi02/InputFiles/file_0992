 for i am conscious of my error my sin is ever before me
 against you you only have i done wrong working that which is evil in your eyes so that your words may be seen to be right and you may be clear when you are judging
 truly i was formed in evil and in sin did my mother give me birth
 your desire is for what is true in the inner parts in the secrets of my soul you will give me knowledge of wisdom
 make me free from sin with hyssop let me be washed whiter than snow
 make me full of joy and rapture so that the bones which have been broken may be glad
 let your face be turned from my wrongdoing and take away all my sins
 make a clean heart in me o god give me a right spirit again
 do not put me away from before you or take your holy spirit from me
 give me back the joy of your salvation let a free spirit be my support
 then will i make your ways clear to wrongdoers and sinners will be turned to you
 be my saviour from violent death o god the god of my salvation and my tongue will give praise to your righteousness
 o lord let my lips be open so that my mouth may make clear your praise
 you have no desire for an offering or i would give it you have no delight in burned offerings
 the offerings of god are a broken spirit a broken and sorrowing heart o god you will not put from you
 do good to zion in your good pleasure building up the walls of jerusalem
 then you will have delight in the offerings of righteousness in burned offerings and offerings of beasts then they will make offerings of oxen on your altar
 &ltto the chief music maker maschil of david when doeg the edomite came to saul saying david has come to the house of ahimelech&gt why do you take pride in wrongdoing lifting yourself up against the upright man all the day
 purposing destruction using deceit your tongue is like a sharp blade
 you have more love for evil than for good for deceit than for works of righteousness  selah 
 destruction is in all your words o false tongue
 but god will put an end to you for ever driving you out from your tent uprooting you from the land of the living  selah 
 the upright will see it with fear and will say laughing at you
 see this is the man who did not make god his strength but had faith in his goods and his property and made himself strong in his wealth
 but i am like a branching olive tree in the house of god i have put my faith in his mercy for ever and ever
 i will give you praise without end for what you have done i will give honour to your name before your saints for it is good
 &ltto the chief music maker put to mahalath maschil of david&gt the foolish man has said in his heart god will not do anything they are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
 god was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after god
 every one of them has gone back they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
 have the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to god
