 him when he was given up by the decision and knowledge of god you put to death on the cross by the hands of evil men
 but god gave him back to life having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it
 for david said of him i saw the lord before my face at all times for he is at my right hand so that i may not be moved
 and for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy and my flesh will be resting in hope
 for you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your holy one to destruction
 you have made me see the ways of life i will be full of joy when i see your face
 my brothers i may say to you openly that david came to his death and was put in the earth and his resting place is with us today
 but being a prophet and having in mind the oath which god had given to him that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king
 he having knowledge of the future was talking of the coming again of christ from the dead that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction
 this jesus god has given back to life of which we all are witnesses
 and so being lifted up to the right hand of god and having the fathers word that the holy spirit would come he has sent this thing which now you see and have knowledge of
 for david has not gone up into heaven but says himself the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand
 till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 for this reason let all israel be certain that this jesus whom you put to death on the cross god has made lord and christ
 now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled and they said to peter and the other apostles brothers what are we to do
 and peter said let your hearts be changed every one of you and have baptism in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will have the holy spirit given to you
 for the word of god is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off even all those who may be marked out by the lord our god
 and with more such words he gave his witness offering them salvation and saying come out from this evil generation
 then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day
 and they kept their attention fixed on the apostles teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer
 but fear came on every soul and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the apostles
 and all those who were of the faith kept together and had all things in common
 and exchanging their goods and property for money they made division of it among them all as they had need
 and day by day going in agreement together regularly to the temple and taking broken bread together in their houses they took their food with joy and with true hearts
 giving praise to god and having the approval of all the people and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the lord
 and after the noise had come to an end paul having sent for the disciples and given them comfort went away from them to macedonia
 and when he had gone through those parts and given them much teaching he came into greece
 and when he had been there three months because the jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for syria he made a decision to go back through macedonia
 and sopater of beroea the son of pyrrhus and aristarchus and secundus of thessalonica and gaius of derbe and timothy and tychicus and trophimus of asia went with him as far as asia
 but these had gone before and were waiting for us at troas
