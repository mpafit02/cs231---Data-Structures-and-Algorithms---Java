 then came the levites rehum the son of bani by his side was working hashabiah ruler of half the division of keilah for his division
 after him were working their brothers bavvai the son of henadad ruler of half the division of keilah
 and by his side was working ezer the son of jeshua the ruler of mizpah making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall
 after him baruch the son of zabbai was hard at work on another part from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of eliashib the chief priest
 after him meremoth the son of uriah the son of hakkoz was working on another part from the door of the house of eliashib as far as the end of his house
 after him were working the priests the men of the lowland
 after them came benjamin and hasshub opposite their house after them azariah the son of maaseiah the son of ananiah made good the wall by the house where he himself was living
 after him binnui the son of henadad was working on another part from the house of azariah as far as the turning of the wall and the angle
 palal the son of uzai made good the wall opposite the angle and the tower which comes out from the higher part of the kings house by the open space of the watch after him was pedaiah the son of parosh
  now the nethinim were living in the ophel as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east and the tower which comes out 
 after him the tekoites were making good another part opposite the great tower which comes out and up to the wall of the ophel
 further on past the horse doorway the priests were at work every one opposite his house
 after them zadok the son of immer was working opposite his house and after him shemaiah the son of shecaniah the keeper of the east door
 after him hananiah the son of shelemiah and hanun the sixth son of zalaph were making good another part after him meshullam the son of berechiah made good the wall opposite his room
 after him malchijah one of the gold workers to the nethinim and the traders made good the wall opposite the doorway of hammiphkad and as far as the way up to the angle
 and between the way up to the angle and the sheep door the gold workers and the traders made good the wall
 now sanballat hearing that we were building the wall was very angry and in his wrath made sport of the jews
 and in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of samaria he said what are these feeble jews doing will they make themselves strong will they make offerings will they get the work done in a day will they make the stones which have been burned come again out of the dust
 now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said such is their building that if a fox goes up it their stone wall will be broken down
 give ear o our god for we are looked down on let their words of shame be turned back on themselves and let them be given up to wasting in a land where they are prisoners
 let not their wrongdoing be covered or their sin washed away from before you for they have made you angry before the builders
 so we went on building the wall and all the wall was joined together half way up for the people were working hard
 but when it came to the ears of sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites that the building of the walls of jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good they were full of wrath
 and they made designs all of them together to come and make an attack on jerusalem causing trouble there
 but we made our prayer to god and had men on watch against them day and night because of them
 and judah said the strength of the workmen is giving way and there is much waste material it is impossible for us to put up the wall
 and those who were against us said without their knowledge and without their seeing us we will come among them and put them to death causing the work to come to a stop
 and it came about that when the jews who were living near them came they said to us ten times from all directions they are coming against us
 so in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls in the open places i put the people by families with their swords their spears and their bows
 and after looking i got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people have no fear of them keep in mind the lord who is great and greatly to be feared and take up arms for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
