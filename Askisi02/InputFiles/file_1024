 take me to you and we will go after you the king has taken me into his house we will be glad and full of joy in you we will give more thought to your love than to wine rightly are they your lovers
 i am dark but fair of form o daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon
 let not your eyes be turned on me because i am dark because i was looked on by the sun my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vine gardens but my vine garden i have not kept
 say o love of my soul where you give food to your flock and where you make them take their rest in the heat of the day why have i to be as one wandering by the flocks of your friends
 if you have not knowledge o most beautiful among women go on your way in the footsteps of the flock and give your young goats food by the tents of the keepers
 i have made a comparison of you o my love to a horse in pharaohs carriages
 your face is a delight with rings of hair your neck with chains of jewels
 we will make you chains of gold with ornaments of silver
 while the king is seated at his table my spices send out their perfume
 as a bag of myrrh is my well loved one to me when he is at rest all night between my breasts
 my love is to me as a branch of the cypress tree in the vine gardens of en gedi
 see you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove
 see you are fair my loved one and a pleasure our bed is green
 cedar trees are the pillars of our house and our boards are made of fir trees
 i am a rose of sharon a flower of the valleys
 as the lily flower among the thorns of the waste so is my love among the daughters
 as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my loved one among the sons i took my rest under his shade with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste
 he took me to the house of wine and his flag over me was love
 make me strong with wine cakes let me be comforted with apples i am overcome with love
 his left hand is under my head and his right hand is round about me
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes of the field do not let love be moved till it is ready
 the voice of my loved one  see he comes dancing on the mountains stepping quickly on the hills
 my loved one is like a roe see he is on the other side of our wall he is looking in at the windows letting himself be seen through the spaces
 my loved one said to me get up my love my fair one and come away
 for see the winter is past the rain is over and gone
 the flowers are come on the earth the time of cutting the vines is come and the voice of the dove is sounding in our land
 the fig tree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell get up from your bed my beautiful one and come away
 o my dove you are in the holes of the mountain sides in the cracks of the high hills let me see your face let your voice come to my ears for sweet is your voice and your face is fair
 take for us the foxes the little foxes which do damage to the vines our vines have young grapes
 my loved one is mine and i am his he takes his food among the flowers
