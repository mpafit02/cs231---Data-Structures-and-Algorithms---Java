 see  as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters and the eyes of a servant girl to her owner so our eyes are waiting for the lord our god till he has mercy on us
 have mercy on us o lord have mercy on us for all men are looking down on us
 for long enough have men of pride made sport of our soul
 &lta song of the going up of david&gt if it had not been the lord who was on our side  let israel now say 
 if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men came up against us
 they would have made a meal of us while still living in the heat of their wrath against us
 we would have been covered by the waters the streams would have gone over our soul
 yes the waters of pride would have gone over our soul
 praise be to the lord who has not let us be wounded by their teeth
 our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her the net is broken and we are free
 our help is in the name of the lord the maker of heaven and earth
 &lta song of the going up&gt those whose hope is in the lord are like the mountain of zion which may not be moved but keeps its place for ever
 as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from this time and for ever
 for the rod of sinners will not be resting on the heritage of the upright so that the upright may not put out their hands to evil
 do good o lord to those who are good and to those who are upright in heart
 but as for such as are turned out of the straight way the lord will take them away with the workers of evil let peace be on israel
 &lta song of the going up&gt when the lord made a change in zions fate we were like men in a dream
 then our mouths were full of laughing and our tongues gave a glad cry they said among the nations the lord has done great things for them
 the lord has done great things for us because of which we are glad
 let our fate be changed o lord like the streams in the south
 those who put in seed with weeping will get in the grain with cries of joy
 though a man may go out weeping taking his vessel of seed with him he will come again in joy with the corded stems of grain in his arms
 &lta song of the going up of solomon&gt if the lord is not helping the builders then the building of a house is to no purpose if the lord does not keep the town the watchman keeps his watch for nothing
 it is of no use for you to get up early and to go late to your rest with the bread of sorrow for your food for the lord gives to his loved ones in sleep
 see sons are a heritage from the lord the fruit of the body is his reward
 like arrows in the hand of a man of war are the children of the young
 happy is the man who has a good store of them he will not be put to shame but his cause will be supported by them against his haters
 &lta song of the going up&gt happy is the worshipper of the lord who is walking in his ways
 you will have the fruit of the work of your hands happy will you be and all will be well for you
 your wife will be like a fertile vine in the inmost parts of your house your children will be like olive plants round your table
