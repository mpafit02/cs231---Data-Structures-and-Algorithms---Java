 but his lord in answer said to him you are a bad and unready servant if you had knowledge that i get in grain where i did not put seed and make profits for which i have done no work
 why then did you not put my money in the bank and at my coming i would have got back what is mine with interest
 take away then his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents
 for to everyone who has will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 and put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 but when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then will he be seated in his glory
 and before him all the nations will come together and they will be parted one from another as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper
 and he will put the sheep on his right but the goats on the left
 then will the king say to those on his right come you who have the blessing of my father into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was
 for i was in need of food and you gave it to me i was in need of drink and you gave it to me i was wandering and you took me in
 i had no clothing and you gave it to me when i was ill or in prison you came to me
 then will the upright make answer to him saying lord when did we see you in need of food and give it to you or in need of drink and give it to you
 and when did we see you wandering and take you in or without clothing and give it to you
 and when did we see you ill or in prison and come to you
 and the king will make answer and say to them truly i say to you because you did it to the least of these my brothers you did it to me
 then will he say to those on the left go from me you cursed ones into the eternal fire which is ready for the evil one and his angels
 for i was in need of food and you gave it not to me i was in need of drink and you gave it not to me
 i was wandering and you took me not in without clothing and you gave me no clothing ill and in prison and you came not to me
 then will they make answer saying lord when did we see you in need of food or drink or wandering or without clothing or ill or in prison and did not take care of you
 then will he make answer to them saying truly i say to you because you did it not to the least of these you did it not to me
 and these will go away into eternal punishment but the upright into eternal life
 and when jesus had come to the end of all these words he said to his disciples
 after two days is the passover and the son of man will be given up to the death of the cross
 then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest who was named caiaphas
 and they made designs together to take jesus by some trick and put him to death
 but they said not while the feast is going on for fear of trouble among the people
 now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
 there came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table
 but when the disciples saw it they were angry saying to what purpose is this waste
 for we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor
