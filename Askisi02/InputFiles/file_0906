 the weight of every silver plate was a hundred and thirty shekels and of every basin seventy the weight of all the silver of the vessels was two thousand and four hundred shekels by the scale of the holy place
 the weight of the twelve gold spoons of spice for burning was ten shekels for every one by the scale of the holy place all the gold of the spoons was a hundred and twenty shekels
 all the oxen for the burned offering were twelve the male sheep twelve the he lambs of the first year twelve with their meal offering and the males of the goats for sin offering twelve
 and all the oxen for the peace offerings twenty four oxen the male sheep sixty and the he goats sixty the he lambs of the first year sixty this was given for the altar after the holy oil was put on it
 and when moses went into the tent of meeting to have talk with him then the voice came to his ears from over the cover which was on the ark of witness from between the two winged ones and he had talk with him
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron when you put the lights in their places the seven lights will give light in front of the support
 and aaron did so he put the lights in their places so that they gave light in front of the support as the lord gave orders to moses
 the support for the lights was of hammered gold work from its base to its flowers it was of hammered work from the design which the lord had given to moses he made the support for the lights
 and the lord said to moses
 take the levites out from among the children of israel and make them clean
 and this is how you are to make them clean let the holy water which takes away sin be put on them and let the hair all over their bodies be cut off with a sharp blade and let their clothing be washed and their bodies made clean
 then let them take a young ox and its meal offering crushed grain mixed with oil and take another ox for a sin offering
 and make the levites come forward in front of the tent of meeting and let all the children of israel come together
 and you are to take the levites before the lord and the children of israel are to put their hands on them
 and aaron is to give the levites to the lord as a wave offering from the children of israel so that they may do the lords work
 and the levites are to put their hands on the heads of the oxen and one of the oxen is to be offered for a sin offering and the other for a burned offering to the lord to take away the sin of the levites
 then the levites are to be put before aaron and his sons to be offered as a wave offering to the lord
 so you are to make the levites separate from the children of israel and the levites will be mine
 after that the levites will go in to do whatever has to be done in the tent of meeting you are to make them clean and give them as a wave offering
 for they have been given to me from among the children of israel in place of every mothers first son the first to come to birth in israel i have taken them for myself
 for every mothers first son among the children of israel is mine the first male birth of man or beast on the day when i sent death on all the first sons in the land of egypt i made them mine
 and in place of the first sons among the children of israel i have taken the levites
 and i have given them to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to undertake for them all the work of the tent of meeting and to take away sin from the children of israel so that no evil may come on them when they come near the holy place
 all these things moses and aaron and the children of israel did to the levites as the lord gave orders to moses about the levites so the children of israel did
 and the levites were made clean from sin and their clothing was washed and aaron gave them for a wave offering before the lord and aaron took away their sin and made them clean
 and then the levites went in to do their work in the tent of meeting before aaron and his sons all the orders which the lord had given moses about the levites were put into effect
 and the lord said to moses
 this is the rule for the levites those of twenty five years old and over are to go in and do the work of the tent of meeting
 but after they are fifty years old they are to give up their work and do no more
