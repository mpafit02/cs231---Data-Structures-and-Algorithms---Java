 and he comes to the disciples and sees that they are sleeping and says to peter what were you not able to keep watch with me one hour
 keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
 again a second time he went away and said in prayer o my father if this may not go from me without my taking it let your pleasure be done
 and he came again and saw them sleeping for their eyes were tired
 and he went away from them again and a third time said the same prayer
 then he comes to the disciples and says to them go on sleeping now and take your rest for the hour is come and the son of man is given into the hands of evil men
 up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
 and while he was still talking judas one of the twelve came and with him a band armed with swords and sticks from the chief priests and those in authority over the people
 now the false one had given them a sign saying the one to whom i give a kiss that is he take him
 and straight away he came to jesus and said master  and gave him a kiss
 and jesus said to him friend do that for which you have come then they came and put hands on jesus and took him
 and one of those who were with jesus put out his hand and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
 then says jesus to him put up your sword again into its place for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword
 does it not seem possible to you that if i make request to my father he will even now send me an army of angels
 but how then would the writings come true which say that so it has to be
 in that hour jesus said to the people have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me i was teaching every day in the temple and you took me not
 but all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true then all his disciples went from him in flight
 and those who had made jesus prisoner took him away to the house of caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together
 but peter went after him at a distance to the house of the high priest and went in and took his seat with the servants to see the end
 now the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were looking for false witness against jesus so that they might put him to death
 and they were not able to get it though a number of false witnesses came
 but later there came two who said this man said i am able to give the temple of god to destruction and to put it up again in three days
 and the high priest got up and said to him have you no answer what is it which these say against you
 but jesus said not a word and the high priest said to him i put you on oath by the living god that you will say to us if you are the christ the son of god
 jesus says to him you say so but i say to you from now you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
 then the high priest violently parting his robes said he has said evil against god what more need have we of witnesses for now his words against god have come to your ears
 what is your opinion they made answer and said it is right for him to be put to death
 then they put shame on him and were cruel to him and some gave him blows saying
 be a prophet o christ and say who gave you a blow 
 now peter was seated in the open square outside the house and a servant girl came to him saying you were with jesus the galilaean
