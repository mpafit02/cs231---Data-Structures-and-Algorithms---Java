 but the children would not be controlled by me they were not guided by my rules and they did not keep and do my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my sabbaths then i said i would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the waste land
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes i had taken them out
 further i gave my oath to them in the waste land that i would send them wandering among the nations driving them out among the countries
 because they had not done my orders but had been turned away from my rules and had not given respect to my sabbaths and their eyes were turned to the images of their fathers
 and further i gave them rules which were not good and orders in which there was no life for them
 i made them unclean in the offerings they gave causing them to make every first child go through the fire so that i might put an end to them
 for this cause son of man say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said in this your fathers have further put shame on my name by doing wrong against me
 for when i had taken them into the land which i made an oath to give to them then they saw every high hill and every branching tree and made their offerings there moving me to wrath by their offerings and there the sweet smell of their offerings went up and their drink offerings were drained out
 then i said to them what is this high place where you go to no purpose and it is named bamah to this day
 for this cause say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said are you making yourselves unclean as your fathers did are you being untrue to me by going after their disgusting works
 and when you give your offerings causing your sons to go through the fire you make yourselves unclean with all your images to this day and will you come to me for directions o children of israel by my life says the lord you will get no direction from me
 and that which comes into your minds will never take place when you say we will be like the nations like the families of the countries servants of wood and stone
 by my life says the lord truly with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose i will be king over you
 and i will take you out from the peoples and get you together out of the countries where you are wandering with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose
 and i will take you into the waste land of the peoples and there i will take up the cause with you face to face
 as i took up the cause with your fathers in the waste land of the land of egypt so will i take up the cause with you says the lord
 and i will make you go under the rod and will make you small in number
 clearing out from among you all those who are uncontrolled and who are sinning against me i will take them out of the land where they are living but they will not come into the land of israel and you will be certain that i am the lord
 as for you o children of israel the lord has said let every man completely put away his images and give ear to me and let my holy name no longer be shamed by your offerings and your images
 for in my holy mountain in the high mountain of israel says the lord there all the children of israel all of them will be my servants in the land there i will take pleasure in them and there i will be worshipped with your offerings and the first fruits of the things you give and with all your holy things
 i will take pleasure in you as in a sweet smell when i take you out from the peoples and get you together from the countries where you have been sent in flight and i will make myself holy in you before the eyes of the nations
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when i take you into the land of israel into the country which i made an oath to give to your fathers
 and there at the memory of your ways and of all the things you did to make yourselves unclean you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of all the evil things you have done
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when i take you in hand for the honour of my name and not for your evil ways or your unclean doings o children of israel says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the south let your words be dropped to the south and be a prophet against the woodland of the south
 and say to the woodland of the south give ear to the words of the lord this is what the lord has said see i will have a fire lighted in you for the destruction of every green tree in you and every dry tree the flaming flame will not be put out and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it
 and all flesh will see that i the lord have had it lighted it will not be put out
 then i said ah lord  they say of me is he not a maker of stories
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
