 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 &ltaleph&gt happy are they who are without sin in their ways walking in the law of the lord
 happy are they who keep his unchanging word searching after him with all their heart
 they do no evil they go in his ways
 you have put your orders into our hearts so that we might keep them with care
 if only my ways were ordered so that i might keep your rules 
 then i would not be put to shame as long as i have respect for all your teaching
 i will give you praise with an upright heart in learning your right decisions
 i will keep your rules o give me not up completely
 &ltbeth&gt how may a young man make his way clean by guiding it after your word
 i have made search for you with all my heart o let me not go wandering far from your teaching
 i have kept your sayings secretly in my heart so that i might do no sin against you
 praise be to you o lord give me knowledge of your rules
 with my lips have i made clear all the decisions of your mouth
 i have taken as much delight in the way of your unchanging word as in all wealth
 i will give thought to your orders and have respect for your ways
 i will have delight in your rules i will not let your word go out of my mind
 &ltgimel&gt give me your servant the reward of life so that i may keep your word
 let my eyes be open to see the wonders of your law
 i am living in a strange land do not let your teachings be kept secret from me
 my soul is broken with desire for your decisions at all times
 your hand has been against the men of pride a curse is on those who go wandering out of your way
 take away from me shame and bitter words for i have kept your unchanging word in my heart
 rulers make evil designs against me but your servant gives thought to your rules
 your unchanging word is my delight and the guide of my footsteps
 &ltdaleth&gt my soul is joined to the dust o give me life in keeping with your word
 i put the record of my ways before you and you gave me an answer o give me knowledge of your rules
 make the way of your orders clear to me then my thoughts will be ever on your wonders
 my soul is wasted with sorrow give me strength again in keeping with your word
 take from me every false way and in mercy give me your law
