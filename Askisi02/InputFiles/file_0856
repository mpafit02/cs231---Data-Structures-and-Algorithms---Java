 and it was evil in my eyes so i had all tobiahs things put out of the room
 then i gave orders and they made the rooms clean and i put back in them the vessels of the house of god with the meal offerings and the perfume
 and i saw that the levites had not been given what was needed for their support so that the levites and the music makers who did the work had gone away everyone to his field
 then i made protests to the chiefs and said why has the house of god been given up and i got them together and put them in their places
 then all judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store houses
 and i made controllers over the store houses shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and with them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers
 keep me in mind o my god in connection with this and do not let the good which i have done for the house of my god and its worship go from your memory completely
 in those days i saw in judah some who were crushing grapes on the sabbath and getting in grain and putting it on asses as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods which they took into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food
 and there were men of tyre there who came with fish and all sorts of goods trading with the children of judah and in jerusalem on the sabbath
 then i made protests to the chiefs of judah and said to them what is this evil which you are doing not keeping the sabbath day holy
 did not your fathers do the same and did not our god send all this evil on us and on this town but you are causing more wrath to come on israel by not keeping the sabbath holy
 and so when the streets of jerusalem were getting dark before the sabbath i gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the sabbath and i put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the sabbath day
 so the traders in all sorts of goods took their nights rest outside jerusalem once or twice
 then i gave witness against them and said why are you waiting all night by the wall if you do so again i will have you taken prisoners from that time they did not come again on the sabbath
 and i gave the levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the sabbath holy keep this in mind to my credit o my god and have mercy on me for great is your mercy
 and in those days i saw the jews who were married to women of ashdod and ammon and moab
 and their children were talking half in the language of ashdod they had no knowledge of the jews language but made use of the language of the two peoples
 and i took up the cause against them cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair and i made them take an oath by god saying you are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves
 was it not in these things that solomon king of israel did wrong among a number of nations there was no king like him and he was dear to his god and god made him king over all israel but even he was made to do evil by strange women
 are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil sinning against our god by taking strange women for your wives
 and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the chief priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite so i sent him away from me
 keep them in mind o my god because they have put shame on the priests name and on the agreement of the priests and the levites
 so i made them clean from all strange people and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the levites everyone in his work
 and for the wood offering at fixed times and for the first fruits keep me in mind o my god for good
 and it came about in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king when wine was before him that i took up the wine and gave it to the king now i had never before been sad when the king was present
 and the king said to me why is your face sad seeing that you are not ill this is nothing but sorrow of heart then i was full of fear
 and said to the king may the king be living for ever is it not natural for my face to be sad when the town the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest has been made waste and its doorways burned with fire
 then the king said to me what is your desire so i made prayer to the god of heaven
 and i said to the king if it is the kings pleasure and if your servant has your approval send me to judah to the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest so that i may take in hand the building of it
 and the king said to me  the queen being seated by his side  how long will your journey take and when will you come back so the king was pleased to send me and i gave him a fixed time
