 my eyes are wasting away with trouble they are becoming old because of all those who are against me
 go from me all you workers of evil for the lord has given ear to the voice of my weeping
 the lord has given ear to my request the lord has let my prayer come before him
 let all those who are against me be shamed and deeply troubled let them be turned back and suddenly put to shame
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shushan eduth michtam of david for teaching when he was fighting against aram naharaim and aramzobah when joab came back and put twelve thousand of the edomites to death in the valley of salt&gt god you have put us away from you you have sent us in all directions you have been angry o be turned to us again
 by the power of your hand the earth is shaking and broken make it strong again for it is moved
 you have made the people see hard times you have given us the wine of shaking for our drink
 give a safe place to those who have fear of you where they may go in flight from before the bow  selah 
 so that your loved ones may be made safe let your right hand be my salvation and give me an answer
 god has said in his holy place i will be glad i will make a division of shechem and the valley of succoth will be measured out
 gilead is mine and manasseh is mine and ephraim is the strength of my head judah is my law giver
 moab is my washpot over edom will i put out my shoe over philistia will a glad cry be sounded
 who will take me into the strong town who will be my guide into edom
 have not you put us away o god and you have not gone out with our armies
 give us help in our trouble for there is no help in man
 through god we will do great things for through him our haters will be crushed under our feet
 &ltto the chief music maker on a corded instrument of david&gt let my cry come to you o god let your ears be open to my prayer
 from the end of the earth will i send up my cry to you when my heart is overcome take me to the rock which is over high for me
 for you have been my secret place and my high tower from those who made war on me
 i will make your tent my resting place for ever i will keep myself under the cover of your wings  selah 
 for you o god have made answer to my prayers you have given me the heritage of those who give honour to your name
 you will give the king long life and make his years go on through the generations
 may the seat of his authority be before god for ever may mercy and righteousness keep him safe
 so will i make songs in praise of your name for ever giving to god that which is right day by day
 &ltto the chief music maker after jeduthun a psalm of david&gt my soul put all your faith in god for from him comes my salvation
 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my high tower i will not be greatly moved
 how long will you go on designing evil against a man running against him as against a broken wall which is on the point of falling
 their only thought is to put him down from his place of honour their delight is in deceit blessing is in their mouths but cursing in their hearts  selah 
 my soul put all your faith in god for from him comes my hope
 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my high tower i will not be greatly moved
