 and the words still one more make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking as of things which are made so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible
 if then we have a kingdom which will never be moved let us have grace so that we may give god such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect
 for our god is an all burning fire
 go on loving your brothers in the faith
 take care to keep open house because in this way some have had angels as their guests without being conscious of it
 keep in mind those who are in chains as if you were chained with them and those who are in trouble as being yourselves in the body
 let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean for men untrue in married life will be judged by god
 be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have for he himself has said i will be with you at all times
 so that we say with a good heart the lord is my helper i will have no fear what is man able to do to me
 keep in mind those who were over you and who gave you the word of god seeing the outcome of their way of life let your faith be like theirs
 jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever
 do not be turned away by different strange teachings because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace and not by meats which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them
 we have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the tent may not take food
 for the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents
 for this reason jesus was put to death outside the walls so that he might make the people holy by his blood
 let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents taking his shame on ourselves
 for here we have no fixed resting place but our search is for the one which is to come
 let us then make offerings of praise to god at all times through him that is to say the fruit of lips giving witness to his name
 but go on doing good and giving to others because god is well pleased with such offerings
 give ear to those who are rulers over you and do as they say for they keep watch over your souls ready to give an account of them let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief because that would be of no profit to you
 make prayers for us for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin desiring the right way of life in all things
 i make this request more strongly in the hope of coming back to you more quickly
 now may the god of peace who made that great keeper of his flock even our lord jesus come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement
 make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through jesus christ and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever so be it
 but brothers take kindly the words which i have said for your profit for i have not sent you a long letter
 our brother timothy has been let out of prison and if he comes here in a short time he and i will come to you together
 give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you and to all the saints those who are in italy send you their love
 may grace be with you all
 for this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears for fear that by chance we might be slipping away
 because if the word which came through the angels was fixed and in the past every evil act against gods orders was given its full punishment
