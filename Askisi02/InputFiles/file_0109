 and jesus himself was weeping
 so the jews said see how dear he was to him 
 but some of them said this man who made open the eyes of the blind man was he not able to keep his friend from death
 so jesus deeply troubled in heart came to the place of the dead it was a hole in the rock and a stone was over the opening
 jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of him who was dead said lord by this time the body will be smelling for he has been dead four days
 jesus said to her did i not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of god
 so they took away the stone and jesus looking up to heaven said father i give praise to you for hearing me
 i was certain that your ears are at all times open to me but i said it because of these who are here so that they may see that you sent me
 then he said in a loud voice lazarus come out 
 and he who was dead came out with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet and a cloth about his face jesus said to them make him free and let him go
 then a number of the jews who had come to mary and had seen the things which jesus did had belief in him
 but some of them went to the pharisees with the news of what jesus had done
 then the high priests and the pharisees had a meeting and said what are we doing this man is doing a number of signs
 if we let him go on in this way everybody will have belief in him and the romans will come and take away our place and our nation
 but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you have no knowledge of anything
 you do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people so that all the nation may not come to destruction
 he did not say this of himself but being the high priest that year he said as a prophet that jesus would be put to death for the nation
 and not for that nation only but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of god all over the world
 and from that day they took thought together how to put him to death
 so jesus no longer went about publicly among the jews but went from there into the country near to the waste land to a town named ephraim where he was for some time with the disciples
 now the passover of the jews was near and numbers of people went up from the country to jerusalem to make themselves clean before the passover
 they were looking for jesus and saying to one another while they were in the temple what is your opinion will he not come to the feast
 now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was he was to give them word so that they might take him
 then six days before the passover jesus came to bethany where lazarus was whom jesus had made to come back from the dead
 so they made him a meal there and he was waited on by martha and lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table
 then mary taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value put it on the feet of jesus and made them dry with her hair and the house became full of the smell of the perfume
 but one of his disciples judas iscariot  who was to give him up  said
 why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence and the money given to the poor
  he said this not because he had any love for the poor but because he was a thief and having the money bag took for himself what was put into it 
 then jesus said let her be let her keep what she has for the day of my death
