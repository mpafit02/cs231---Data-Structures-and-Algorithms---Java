 the simple man goes after her like an ox going to its death like a roe pulled by a cord
 like a bird falling into a net with no thought that his life is in danger till an arrow goes into his side
 so now my sons give ear to me give attention to the sayings of my mouth
 let not your heart be turned to her ways do not go wandering in her footsteps
 for those wounded and made low by her are great in number and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army
 her house is the way to the underworld going down to the rooms of death
 is not wisdom crying out and the voice of knowledge sounding
 at the top of the highways at the meeting of the roads she takes her place
 where the roads go into the town her cry goes out at the doorways her voice is loud
 i am crying out to you o men my voice comes to the sons of men
 become expert in reason o you simple ones you foolish ones take training to heart
 give ear for my words are true and my lips are open to give out what is upright
 for good faith goes out of my mouth and false lips are disgusting to me
 all the words of my mouth are righteousness there is nothing false or twisted in them
 they are all true to him whose mind is awake and straightforward to those who get knowledge
 take my teaching and not silver get knowledge in place of the best gold
 for wisdom is better than jewels and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her
 i wisdom have made wise behaviour my near relation i am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes
 the fear of the lord is seen in hating evil pride a high opinion of oneself the evil way and the false tongue are unpleasing to me
 wise design and good sense are mine reason and strength are mine
 through me kings have their power and rulers give right decisions
 through me chiefs have authority and the noble ones are judging in righteousness
 those who have given me their love are loved by me and those who make search for me with care will get me
 wealth and honour are in my hands even wealth without equal and righteousness
 my fruit is better than gold even than the best gold and my increase is more to be desired than silver
 i go in the road of righteousness in the way of right judging
 so that i may give my lovers wealth for their heritage making their store houses full
 the lord made me as the start of his way the first of his works in the past
 from eternal days i was given my place from the birth of time before the earth was
 when there was no deep i was given birth when there were no fountains flowing with water
