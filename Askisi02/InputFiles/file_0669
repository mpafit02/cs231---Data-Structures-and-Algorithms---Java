 and he said to me you are my servant israel in whom my glory will be seen
 and i said i have undergone weariness for nothing i have given my strength for no purpose or profit but still the lord will take up my cause and my god will give me my reward
 and now says the lord who made me his servant when i was still in my mothers body so that i might make jacob come back to him and so that israel might come together to him and i was honoured in the eyes of the lord and my god became my strength
 it is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of jacob again in their place and to get back those of israel who have been sent away my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations so that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth
 the lord who takes up israels cause even his holy one says to him whom men make sport of who is hated by the nations a servant of rulers kings will see and get up from their places and chiefs will give worship because of the lord who keeps faith even the holy one of israel who has taken you for himself
 this is the word of the lord i have given ear to you at a good time and i have been your helper in a day of salvation and i will keep you safe and will make you a glory for the people putting the land in order and giving them the heritages which now are waste
 saying to those who are in chains go free to those who are in the dark come out into the light they will get food by the way wherever they go and have grass lands on all the dry mountain tops
 they will not be in need of food or drink or be troubled by the heat or the sun for he who has mercy on them will be their guide taking them by the springs of water
 and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways will be lifted up
 see these are coming from far and these from the north and the west and these from the land of sinim
 let your voice be loud in song o heavens and be glad o earth make sounds of joy o mountains for the lord has given comfort to his people and will have mercy on his crushed ones
 but zion said the lord has given me up i have gone from his memory
 will a woman give up the child at her breast will she be without pity for the fruit of her body yes these may but i will not let you go out of my memory
 see your name is marked on my hands your walls are ever before me
 your builders are coming quickly your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you
 let your eyes be lifted up round about and see they are all coming together to you by my life says the lord truly you will put them all on you as an ornament and be clothed with them like a bride
 for though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction now you will not be wide enough for your people and those who made you waste will be far away
 the children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears the place is not wide enough for me make room for me to have a resting place
 then you will say in your heart who has given me all these children when my children had been taken from me and i was no longer able to have others who took care of these when i was by myself where then were these
 this is the word of the lord god see i will make a sign with my hand to the nations and put up my flag for the peoples and they will take up your sons on their beasts and your daughters on their backs
 and kings will take care of you and queens will give you their milk they will go down on their faces before you kissing the dust of your feet and you will be certain that i am the lord and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed
 will the goods of war be taken from the strong man or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go
 but the lord says even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him and the cruel made to let go his goods for i will take up your cause against your haters and i will keep your children safe
 and the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food and they will take their blood for drink as if it was sweet wine and all men will see that i the lord am your saviour even he who takes up your cause the strong one of jacob
 let me make a song about my loved one a song of love for his vine garden my loved one had a vine garden on a fertile hill
 and after working the earth of it with a spade he took away its stones and put in it a very special vine and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it hollowing out in the rock a place for the grape crushing and he was hoping that it would give the best grapes but it gave common grapes
 and now you people of jerusalem and you men of judah be the judges between me and my vine garden
 is there anything which might have been done for my vine garden which i have not done why then when i was hoping for the best grapes did it give me common grapes
 and now this is what i will do to my vine garden i will take away the circle of thorns round it and it will be burned up its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it
 and i will make it waste its branches will not be touched with the knife or the earth worked with the spade but blackberries and thorns will come up in it and i will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it
