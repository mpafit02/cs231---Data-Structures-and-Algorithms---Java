 and the field is the world and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom and the evil seeds are the sons of the evil one
 and he who put them in the earth is satan and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world and those who get it in are the angels
 as then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire so will it be in the end of the world
 the son of man will send out his angels and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error and all those who do wrong
 and will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him give ear
 the kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field which a man came across and put back again and in his joy he goes and gives all he has to get that field
 again the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels
 and having come across one jewel of great price he went and gave all he had in exchange for it
 again the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish
 when it was full they took it up on the sands and seated there they put the good into vessels but the bad they put away
 so will it be in the end of the world the angels will come and take out the bad from the good
 and will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 are all these things now clear to you they say to him yes
 and he said to them for this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who gives out from his store things new and old
 and when jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there
 and coming into his country he gave them teaching in their synagogue so that they were greatly surprised and said where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power
 is not this the woodworkers son is not his mother named mary and his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas
 and his sisters are they not all with us from where then has he all these things
 and they were bitter against him but jesus said to them a prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family
 and the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith
 at that time news of jesus came to herod the king
 and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has come back from the dead and so these powers are working in him
 for herod had taken john and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife
 because john had said to him it is not right for you to have her
 and he would have put him to death but for his fear of the people because in their eyes john was a prophet
 but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias was dancing before them and herod was pleased with her
 so he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for
 and she at her mothers suggestion said give me here on a plate the head of john the baptist
 and the king was sad but because of his oaths and because of his guests he gave the order for it to be given to her
