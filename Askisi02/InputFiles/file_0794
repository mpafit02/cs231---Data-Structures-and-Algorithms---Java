 so the woman running quickly gave her husband the news saying i have seen the man who came to me the other day
 and manoah got up and went after his wife and came up to the man and said to him are you the man who was talking to this woman and he said i am
 and manoah said now when your words come true what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work
 and the angel of the lord said to manoah let the woman take note of what i have said to her
 she is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean let her take care to do all i have given her orders to do
 and manoah said to the angel of the lord now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you
 and the angel of the lord said to manoah though you keep me i will not take of your food but if you will make a burned offering let it be offered to the lord for it had not come into manoahs mind that he was the angel of the lord
 then manoah said to the angel of the lord what is your name so that when your words come true we may give you honour
 but the angel of the lord said to him why are you questioning me about my name seeing that it is a wonder
 so manoah took the young goat with its meal offering offering it on the rock to the lord who did strange things
 and when the flame went up to heaven from the altar the angel of the lord went up in the flame of the altar while manoah and his wife were looking on and they went down on their faces to the earth
 but the angel of the lord was seen no more by manoah and his wife then it was clear to manoah that he was the angel of the lord
 and manoah said to his wife death will certainly be our fate for it is a god whom we have seen
 but his wife said to him if the lord was purposing our death he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering or have given us such orders about the child
 so the woman gave birth to a son and gave him the name samson and he became a man and the blessing of the lord was on him
 and the spirit of the lord first came on him in mahaneh dan between zorah and eshtaol
 now samson went down to timnah and saw a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines
 and when he came back he said to his father and mother i have seen a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines get her now for me for my wife
 then his father and mother said to him is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people that you have to go for your wife to the philistines who are without circumcision but samson said to his father get her for me for she is pleasing to me
 now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the lord who had the destruction of the philistines in mind now the philistines at that time were ruling over israel
 then samson went down to timnah  and his father and his mother  and came to the vine gardens of timnah and a young lion came rushing out at him
 and the spirit of the lord came on him with power and unarmed as he was pulling the lion in two as one might do to a young goat he put him to death  but he said nothing to his father and mother of what he had done 
 so he went down and had talk with the woman and she was pleasing to samson
 then after a time he went back to take her and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion and honey there
 and he took the honey in his hand and went on tasting it on the way and when he came to his father and mother he gave some to them but did not say that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion
 then samson went down to the woman and made a feast there as was the way among young men
 and he took thirty friends and they were with him
 and samson said now i have a hard question for you if you are able to give me the answer before the seven days of the feast are over i will give you thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing
 but if you are not able to give me the answer then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing and they said to him put your hard question and let us see what it is
 and he said out of the taker of food came food and out of the strong came the sweet and at the end of three days they were still not able to give the answer
