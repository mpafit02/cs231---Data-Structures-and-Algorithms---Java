 there is no one to give a decision between us who might have control over us
 let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me
 then i would say what is in my mind without fear of him for there is no cause of fear in myself
 the word of the lord which came to joel the son of pethuel
 give ear to this you old men and take note you people of the land has this ever been in your days or in the days of your fathers
 give the story of it to your children and let them give it to their children and their children to another generation
 what the worm did not make a meal of has been taken by the locust and what the locust did not take has been food for the plant worm and what the plant worm did not take has been food for the field fly
 come out of your sleep you who are overcome with wine and give yourselves to weeping give cries of sorrow all you drinkers of wine because of the sweet wine for it has been cut off from your mouths
 for a nation has come up over my land strong and without number his teeth are the teeth of a lion and he has the back teeth of a great lion
 by him my vine is made waste and my fig tree broken he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth its branches are made white
 make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed in haircloth for the husband of her early years
 the meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the lord the priests the lords servants are sorrowing
 the fields are wasted the land has become dry for the grain is wasted the new wine is kept back the oil is poor
 the farmers are shamed the workers in the vine gardens give cries of grief for the wheat and the barley for the produce of the fields has come to destruction
 the vine has become dry and the fig tree is feeble the pomegranate and the palm tree and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are dry because joy has gone from the sons of men
 put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow you priests give cries of grief you servants of the altar come in and clothed in haircloth let the night go past you servants of my god for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your god
 let a time be fixed for going without food have a holy meeting let the old men even all the people of the land come together to the house of the lord your god crying out to the lord
 sorrow for the day  for the day of the lord is near and as destruction from the ruler of all it will come
 is not food cut off before our eyes joy and delight from the house of our god
 the grains have become small and dry under the spade the store houses are made waste the grain stores are broken down for the grain is dry and dead
 what sounds of pain come from the beasts  the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen
 o lord my cry goes up to you for fire has put an end to the grass lands of the waste and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame
 the beasts of the field are turning to you with desire for the water streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass lands of the waste
 let the horn be sounded in zion and a war cry in my holy mountain let all the people of the land be troubled for the day of the lord is coming
 for a day of dark and deep shade is near a day of cloud and black night like a black cloud a great and strong people is covering the mountains there has never been any like them and will not be after them again from generation to generation
 before them fire sends destruction and after them flame is burning the land is like the garden of eden before them and after them an unpeopled waste truly nothing has been kept safe from them
 their form is like the form of horses and they are running like war horses
 like the sound of war carriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grain stems like a strong people lined up for the fight
 at their coming the people are bent with pain all faces become red together
 they are running like strong men they go over the wall like men of war every man goes straight on his way their lines are not broken
