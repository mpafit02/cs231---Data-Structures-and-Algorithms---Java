 they have said with our tongues will we overcome our lips are ours who is lord over us
 because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need now will i come to his help says the lord i will give him the salvation which he is desiring
 the words of the lord are true words like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times
 you will keep them o lord you will keep them safe from this generation for ever
 the sinners are walking on every side and evil is honoured among the children of men
 &lta song of the going up&gt in my trouble my cry went up to the lord and he gave me an answer
 o lord be the saviour of my soul from false lips and from the tongue of deceit
 what punishment will he give you what more will he do to you you false tongue
 sharp arrows of the strong and burning fire
 sorrow is mine because i am strange in meshech and living in the tents of kedar
 my soul has long been living with the haters of peace
 i am for peace but when i say so they are for war
 &lta song of the going up&gt my eyes are lifted up to the hills o where will my help come from
 your help comes from the lord who made heaven and earth
 may he not let your foot be moved no need of sleep has he who keeps you
 see the eyes of israels keeper will not be shut in sleep
 the lord is your keeper the lord is your shade on your right hand
 you will not be touched by the sun in the day or by the moon at night
 the lord will keep you safe from all evil he will take care of your soul
 the lord will keep watch over your going out and your coming in from this time and for ever
 &lta song of the going up of david&gt i was glad because they said to me we will go into the house of the lord
 at last our feet were inside your doors o jerusalem
 o jerusalem you are like a town which is well joined together
 to which the tribes went up even the tribes of the lord for a witness to israel to give praise to the name of the lord
 for there seats for the judges were placed even the rulers seats of the line of david
 o make prayers for the peace of jerusalem may they whose love is given to you do well
 may peace be inside your walls and wealth in your noble houses
 because of my brothers and friends i will now say let peace be with you
 because of the house of the lord our god i will be working for your good
 &lta song of the going up&gt to you my eyes are lifted up even to you whose seat is in the heavens
