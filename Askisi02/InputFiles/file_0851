 but even she has been taken away she has gone away as a prisoner even her young children are smashed to bits at the top of all the streets the fate of her honoured men is put to the decision of chance and all her great men are put in chains
 and you will be overcome with wine you will become feeble you will be looking for a safe place from those who are fighting against you
 all your walled places will be like fig trees and your people like the first figs falling at a shake into the mouth which is open for them
 see the people who are in you are women the doorways of your land are wide open to your attackers the locks of your doors have been burned away in the fire
 get water for the time when you are shut in make strong your towns go into the potters earth stamping it down with your feet make strong the brickworks
 there the fire will make you waste you will be cut off by the sword make yourself as great in number as the worms as great in number as the locusts
 let your traders be increased more than the stars of heaven
 your crowned ones are like the locusts and your scribes like the clouds of insects which take cover in the walls on a cold day but when the sun comes up they go in flight and are seen no longer in their place
 sorrow  how are the keepers of your flock sleeping o king of assyria  your strong men are at rest your people are wandering on the mountains and there is no one to get them together
 your pain may not be made better you are wounded to death all those hearing the news about you will be waving their hands in joy over you for who has not undergone the weight of your evil doing again and again
 the history of nehemiah the son of hacaliah now it came about in the month chislev in the twentieth year when i was in shushan the kings town
 that hanani one of my brothers came with certain men from judah and in answer to my request for news of the jews who had been prisoners and had got away and of jerusalem
 they said to me the small band of jews now living there in the land are in great trouble and shame the wall of jerusalem has been broken down and its doorways burned with fire
 then after hearing these words for some days i gave myself up to weeping and sorrow seated on the earth and taking no food i made prayer to the god of heaven
 and said o lord the god of heaven the great god greatly to be feared keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws
 let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant which i make before you at this time day and night for the children of israel your servants while i put before you the sins of the children of israel which we have done against you truly i and my fathers people are sinners
 we have done great wrong against you and have not kept the orders the rules and the decisions which you gave to your servant moses
 keep in mind o lord the order you gave your servant moses saying if you do wrong i will send you wandering among the peoples
 but if you come back to me and keep my orders and do them even if those of you who have been forced out are living in the farthest parts of heaven i will get them from there and take them back to the place marked out by me for the resting place of my name
 now these are your servants and your people whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand
 o lord let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant and of the prayers of your servants who take delight in worshipping your name give help o lord to your servant this day and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man  now i was the kings wine servant 
 now those who put down their names were nehemiah the tirshatha the son of hacaliah and zedekiah
