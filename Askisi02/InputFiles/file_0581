 and hadoram and uzal and diklah
 and obal and abimael and sheba
 and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
 and their country was from mesha in the direction of sephar the mountain of the east
 these with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations are the offspring of shem
 these are the families of the sons of noah in the order of their generations and their nations from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters
 and all the earth had one language and one tongue
 and it came about that in their wandering from the east they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of shinar and there they made their living place
 and they said one to another come let us make bricks burning them well and they had bricks for stone putting them together with sticky earth
 and they said come let us make a town and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven and let us make a great name for ourselves so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth
 and the lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building
 and the lord said see they are all one people and have all one language and this is only the start of what they may do and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs
 come let us go down and take away the sense of their language so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another
 so the lord god sent them away into every part of the earth and they gave up building their town
 so it was named babel because there the lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the lord sent them away over all the face of the earth
