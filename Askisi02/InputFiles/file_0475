 the work of the foolish will be a weariness to him because he has no knowledge of the way to the town
 unhappy is the land whose king is a boy and whose rulers are feasting in the morning
 happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth and whose chiefs take food at the right time for strength and not for feasting
 when no work is done the roof goes in and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house
 a feast is for laughing and wine makes glad the heart but by the one and the other money is wasted
 say not a curse against the king even in your thoughts and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth because a bird of the air will take the voice and that which has wings will give news of it
 put out your bread on the face of the waters for after a long time it will come back to you again
 give a part to seven or even to eight because you have no knowledge of the evil which will be on the earth
 if the clouds are full of rain they send it down on the earth and if a tree comes down to the south or the north in whatever place it comes down there it will be
 he who is watching the wind will not get the seed planted and he who is looking at the clouds will not get in the grain
 as you have no knowledge of the way of the wind or of the growth of the bones in the body of her who is with child even so you have no knowledge of the works of god who has made all
 in the morning put your seed into the earth and till the evening let not your hand be at rest because you are not certain which will do well this or that  or if the two will be equally good
 truly the light is sweet and it is good for the eyes to see the sun
 but even if a mans life is long and he has joy in all his years let him keep in mind the dark days because they will be great in number whatever may come is to no purpose
 have joy o young man while you are young and let your heart be glad in the days of your strength and go in the ways of your heart and in the desire of your eyes but be certain that for all these things god will be your judge
 so put away trouble from your heart and sorrow from your flesh because the early years and the best years are to no purpose
 let your mind be turned to your maker in the days of your strength while the evil days come not and the years are far away when you will say i have no pleasure in them
 while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars are not dark and the clouds come not back after the rain
 in the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear and the strong men are bent down and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small and those looking out of the windows are unable to see
 when the doors are shut in the street and the sound of the crushing is low and the voice of the bird is soft and the daughters of music will be made low
 and he is in fear of that which is high and danger is in the road and the tree is white with flower and the least thing is a weight and desire is at an end because man goes to his last resting place and those who are sorrowing are in the streets
 before ever the silver cord is cut or the vessel of gold is broken or the pot is broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the water hole
 and the dust goes back to the earth as it was and the spirit goes back to god who gave it
 all things are to no purpose says the preacher all is to no purpose
 and because the preacher was wise he still gave the people knowledge searching out testing and putting in order a great number of wise sayings
 the preacher made search for words which were pleasing but his writing was in words upright and true
 the words of the wise are pointed and sayings grouped together are like nails fixed with a hammer they are given by one guide
 and further my son take note of this of the making of books there is no end and much learning is a weariness to the flesh
 this is the last word all has been said have fear of god and keep his laws because this is right for every man
 god will be judge of every work with every secret thing good or evil
