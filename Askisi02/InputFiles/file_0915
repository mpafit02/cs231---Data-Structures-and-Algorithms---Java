 the hater of authority has no love for teaching he will not go to the wise
 a glad heart makes a shining face but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken
 the heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge but foolish things are the food of the unwise
 all the days of the troubled are evil but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast
 better is a little with the fear of the lord than great wealth together with trouble
 better is a simple meal where love is than a fat ox and hate with it
 an angry man makes men come to blows but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting
 thorns are round the way of the hater of work but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway
 a wise son makes a glad father but a foolish man has no respect for his mother
 foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise but a man of good sense makes his way straight
 where there are no wise suggestions purposes come to nothing but by a number of wise guides they are made certain
 a man has joy in the answer of his mouth and a word at the right time how good it is 
 acting wisely is the way of life guiding a man away from the underworld
 the house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the lord but he will make safe the heritage of the widow
 evil designs are disgusting to the lord but the words of the clean hearted are pleasing
 he whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family but he who has no desire for offerings will have life
 the heart of the upright gives thought to his answer but from the mouth of the evil doer comes a stream of evil things
 the lord is far from sinners but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright
 the light of the eyes is a joy to the heart and good news makes the bones fat
 the man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise
 he who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom
 the fear of the lord is the teaching of wisdom and a low opinion of oneself goes before honour
 the designs of the heart are mans but the answer of the tongue comes from the lord
 all a mans ways are clean to himself but the lord puts mens spirits into his scales
 put your works into the hands of the lord and your purposes will be made certain
 the lord has made everything for his purpose even the sinner for the day of evil
 everyone who has pride in his heart is disgusting to the lord he will certainly not go free from punishment
 by mercy and good faith evil doing is taken away and by the fear of the lord men are turned away from evil
 when a mans ways are pleasing to the lord he makes even his haters be at peace with him
 better is a little with righteousness than great wealth with wrongdoing
