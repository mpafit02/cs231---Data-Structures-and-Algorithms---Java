 i said in my heart i will give you joy for a test so take your pleasure  but it was to no purpose
 of laughing i said it is foolish and of joy  what use is it
 i made a search with my heart to give pleasure to my flesh with wine still guiding my heart with wisdom and to go after foolish things so that i might see what was good for the sons of men to do under the heavens all the days of their life
 i undertook great works building myself houses and planting vine gardens
 i made myself gardens and fruit gardens planting in them fruit trees of all sorts
 i made pools to give water for the woods with their young trees
 i got men servants and women servants and they gave birth to sons and daughters in my house i had great wealth of herds and flocks more than all who were in jerusalem before me
 i got together silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries i got makers of song male and female and the delights of the sons of men  girls of all sorts to be my brides
 and i became great increasing more than all who had been before me in jerusalem and my wisdom was still with me
 and nothing which was desired by my eyes did i keep from them i did not keep any joy from my heart because my heart took pleasure in all my work and this was my reward
 then i saw all the works which my hands had made and everything i had been working to do and i saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind and there was no profit under the sun
 and i went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways what may the man do who comes after the king the thing which he has done before
 then i saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways  as the light is better than the dark
 the wise mans eyes are in his head but the foolish man goes walking in the dark but still i saw that the same event comes to them all
 then said i in my heart as it comes to the foolish man so will it come to me so why have i been wise overmuch then i said in my heart this again is to no purpose
 of the wise man as of the foolish man there is no memory for ever seeing that those who now are will have gone from memory in the days to come see how death comes to the wise as to the foolish 
 so i was hating life because everything under the sun was evil to me all is to no purpose and desire for wind
 hate had i for all my work which i had done because the man who comes after me will have its fruits
 and who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish but he will have power over all my work which i have done and in which i have been wise under the sun this again is to no purpose
 so my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble i had taken and all my wisdom under the sun
 because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom with knowledge and with an expert hand but one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage this again is to no purpose and a great evil
 what does a man get for all his work and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun
 all his days are sorrow and his work is full of grief even in the night his heart has no rest this again is to no purpose
 there is nothing better for a man than taking meat and drink and having delight in his work this again i saw was from the hand of god
 who may take food or have pleasure without him
 to the man with whom he is pleased god gives wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth to give to him in whom god has pleasure this again is to no purpose and desire for wind
 for everything there is a fixed time and a time for every business under the sun
 a time for birth and a time for death a time for planting and a time for uprooting
 a time to put to death and a time to make well a time for pulling down and a time for building up
 a time for weeping and a time for laughing a time for sorrow and a time for dancing
