 then the lord said to joshua have no fear and do not be troubled take with you all the fighting men and go up against ai for i have given into your hands the king of ai and his people and his town and his land
 and you are to do to ai and its king as you did to jericho and its king but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back
 so joshua and the fighting men got ready to go up against ai and joshua took thirty thousand men of war and sent them out by night
 and he gave them their orders saying go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town do not go very far away and let all of you be ready
 and i and all the people with me will come near the town and when they come out against us as they did before we will go in flight from them
 and they will come out after us till we have got them away from the town for they will say they have gone in flight from us as before so we will go in flight before them
 then you will get up from your secret position and take the town for the lord your god will give it up into your hands
 and when you have taken the town put fire to it as the lord has said see i have given you your orders
 so joshua sent them out and they took up a secret position between beth el and ai on the west side of ai but joshua kept with the people that night
 and early in the morning joshua got up and put the people in order and he and the chiefs of israel went up before the people to ai
 and all the fighting men who were with him went up and came near the town and took up a position on the north side of ai facing the town with a valley between him and the town
 and taking about five thousand men he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of ai between beth el and ai
 so all the people were in their places the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west and that night joshua went down into the valley
 now when the king of ai saw it he got up quickly and went out to war against israel he and all his people to the slope going down to the valley but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town
 then joshua and all israel acting as if they were overcome before them went in flight by way of the waste land
 and all the people in ai came together to go after them and they went after joshua moving away from the town
 there was not a man in ai and beth el who did not go out after israel and the town was open and unwatched while they went after israel
 and the lord said to joshua let your spear be stretched out against ai for i will give it into your hands so joshua took up his spear stretching it out in the direction of the town
 then the secret force came quickly from their place and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out went into the town and took it and put fire to it straight away
 then the men of ai looking back saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven and were unable to go this way or that and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them
 and when joshua and all israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack and that the smoke of the town had gone up turning round they overcame the men of ai
 then the other force came out of the town against them so that they were being attacked on this side and on that and israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life
 but the king of ai they made prisoner and took him to joshua
 then after the destruction of all the people of ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them and when all the people had been put to death without mercy all israel went back to ai and put to death all who were in it without mercy
 on that day twelve thousand were put to death men and women all the people of ai
 for joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of ai was complete
 but the cattle and the goods from that town israel took for themselves as the lord had given orders to joshua
 so joshua gave ai to the flames and made it a waste mass of stones for ever as it is to this day
 and he put the king of ai to death hanging him on a tree till evening and when the sun went down joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree and put it in the public place of the town covering it with a great mass of stones which is there to this day
 then joshua put up an altar to the lord the god of israel in mount ebal
