 and it will come about in those days that i will give to gog a last resting place there in israel in the valley of abarim on the east of the sea and those who go through will be stopped and there gog and all his people will be put to rest and the place will be named the valley of hamon gog
 and the children of israel will be seven months putting them in the earth so as to make the land clean
 and all the people of the land will put them in the earth and it will be to their honour in the day when i let my glory be seen says the lord
 and they will put on one side men to do no other work but to go through the land and put in the earth the rest of those who are still on the face of the land to make it clean after seven months are ended they are to make a search
 and while they go through the land if anyone sees a mans bone he is to put up a sign by the place till those who are doing the work have put it in the earth in the valley of hamon gog
 and there they will put all the army of gog in the earth so they will make the land clean
 and you son of man this is what the lord has said say to the birds of every sort and to all the beasts of the field get together and come come together on every side to the offering which i am putting to death for you a great offering on the mountains of israel so that you may have flesh for your food and blood for your drink
 the flesh of the men of war will be your food and your drink the blood of the princes of the earth of sheep and lambs of he goats of oxen all of them fat beasts of bashan
 you will go on feasting on the fat till you are full and drinking the blood till you are overcome with it of my offering which i have put to death for you
 at my table you will have food in full measure horses and war carriages great men and all the men of war says the lord
 and i will put my glory among the nations and all the nations will see my punishments which i have put into effect and my hand which i have put on them
 so the children of israel will be certain that i am the lord their god from that day and for the future
 and it will be clear to the nations that the children of israel were taken away prisoners for their evil doing because they did wrong against me and my face was covered from them so i gave them up into the hands of their attackers and they all came to their end by the sword
 in the measure of their unclean ways and their sins so i did to them and i kept my face covered from them
 for this cause the lord has said now i will let the fate of jacob be changed and i will have mercy on all the children of israel and will take care of the honour of my holy name
 and they will be conscious of their shame and of all the wrong which they have done against me when they are living in their land with no sense of danger and with no one to be a cause of fear to them
 when i have taken them back from among the peoples and got them together out of the lands of their haters and have made myself holy in them before the eyes of a great number of nations
 and they will be certain that i am the lord their god because i sent them away as prisoners among the nations and have taken them together back to their land and i have not let one of them be there any longer
 and my face will no longer be covered from them for i have sent the out flowing of my spirit on the children of israel says the lord
 and you son of man take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town even jerusalem
 and make an attack on it shutting it in building strong places against it and making high an earthwork against it and put up tents against it placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls
 and take a flat iron plate and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town and let your face be turned to it and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it this will be a sign to the children of israel
 then stretching yourself out on your left side take the sin of the children of israel on yourself for as long as you are stretched out so long will the sin of the children of israel be on you
 for i have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days even three hundred and ninety days and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of israel
 and when these days are ended turning on your right side you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of judah forty days a day for a year i have had it fixed for you
 and let your face be turned to where jerusalem is shut in with your arm uncovered and be a prophet against it
 and see i will put bands on you and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended
 and take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food
 and you are to take your food by weight twenty shekels a day you are to take it at regular times
 and you are to take water by measure the sixth part of a hin you are to take it at regular times
