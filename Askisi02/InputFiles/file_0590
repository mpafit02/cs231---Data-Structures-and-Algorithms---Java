 and abraham said because it seemed to me that there was no fear of god in this place and that they might put me to death because of my wife
 and in fact she is my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
 and when god sent me wandering from my fathers house i said to her let this be the sign of your love for me wherever we go say of me he is my brother
 then abimelech gave to abraham sheep and oxen and men servants and women servants and gave him back his wife sarah
 and abimelech said see all my land is before you take whatever place seems good to you
 and he said to sarah see i have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right now your honour is clear in the eyes of all
 then abraham made prayer to god and god made abimelech well again and his wife and his women servants so that they had children
 for the lord had kept all the women of the house of abimelech from having children because of sarah abrahams wife
 and the lord came to sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken
 and sarah became with child and gave abraham a son when he was old at the time named by god
 and abraham gave to his son to whom sarah had given birth the name isaac
 and when his son isaac was eight days old abraham made him undergo circumcision as god had said to him
 now abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of isaac took place
 and sarah said god has given me cause for laughing and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me
 and she said who would have said to abraham that sarah would have a child at her breast for see i have given him a son now when he is old
 and when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast abraham made a great feast
 and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian playing with isaac
 so she said to abraham send away that woman and her son for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son isaac
 and this was a great grief to abraham because of his son
 but god said let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and hagar his mother give ear to whatever sarah says to you because it is from isaac that your seed will take its name
 and i will make a nation of the son of your servant woman because he is your seed
 and early in the morning abraham got up and gave hagar some bread and a water skin and put the boy on her back and sent her away and she went wandering in the waste land of beer sheba
 and when all the water in the skin was used up she put the child down under a tree
 and she went some distance away about an arrow flight and seating herself on the earth she gave way to bitter weeping saying let me not see the death of my child
 and the boys cry came to the ears of god and the angel of god said to hagar from heaven hagar why are you weeping have no fear for the childs cry has come to the ears of god
 come take your child in your arms for i will make of him a great nation
 then god made her eyes open and she saw a water spring and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink
 and god was with the boy and he became tall and strong and he became a bowman living in the waste land
 and while he was in the waste land of paran his mother got him a wife from the land of egypt
 now at that time abimelech and phicol the captain of his army said to abraham i see that god is with you in all you do
