 all is well for the man who is kind and gives freely to others he will make good his cause when he is judged
 he will not ever be moved the memory of the upright will be living for ever
 he will have no fear of evil news his heart is fixed for his hope is in the lord
 his heart is resting safely he will have no fear till he sees trouble come on his haters
 he has given with open hands to the poor his righteousness is for ever his horn will be lifted up with honour
 the sinner will see it with grief he will be wasted away with envy the desire of the evil doers will come to nothing
 let the lord be praised o you servants of the lord give praise to the name of the lord
 let blessing be on the name of the lord from this time and for ever
 from the coming up of the sun to its going down the lords name is to be praised
 the lord is high over all nations and his glory is higher than the heavens
 who is like the lord our god who is seated on high
 looking down on the heavens and on the earth
 he takes the poor man out of the dust lifting him up from his low position
 to give him a place among the rulers even with the rulers of his people
 he gives the unfertile woman a family making her a happy mother of children give praise to the lord
 when israel came out of egypt the children of jacob from a people whose language was strange to them
 judah became his holy place and israel his kingdom
 the sea saw it and went in flight jordan was turned back
 the mountains were jumping like goats and the little hills like lambs
 what was wrong with you o sea that you went in flight o jordan that you were turned back
 you mountains why were you jumping like goats and you little hills like lambs
 be troubled o earth before the lord before the god of jacob
 who made the rock into a water spring and the hard stone into a fountain
 not to us o lord not to us but to your name let glory be given because of your mercy and your unchanging faith
 why may the nations say where is now their god
 but our god is in heaven he has done whatever was pleasing to him
 their images are silver and gold the work of mens hands
 they have mouths but no voice they have eyes but they see not
 they have ears but no hearing they have noses but no sense of smell
 they have hands without feeling and feet without power of walking and no sound comes from their throat
