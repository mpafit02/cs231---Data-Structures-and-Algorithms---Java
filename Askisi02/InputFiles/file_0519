 the priests bag was designed like the ephod of the best linen worked with gold and blue and purple and red
 it was square and folded in two as long and as wide as the stretch of a mans hand
 and on it they put four lines of stones in the first line was a carnelian a chrysolite and an emerald
 in the second a ruby a sapphire and an onyx
 in the third a jacinth an agate and an amethyst
 in the fourth a topaz a beryl and a jasper they were fixed in twisted frames of gold
 there were twelve stones for the twelve tribes of israel on every one the name of one of the tribes of israel was cut like the cutting of a stamp
 and on the bag they put gold chains twisted like cords
 and they made two gold frames and two gold rings the rings being fixed to the ends of the priests bag
 and they put the two twisted chains on the two rings at the ends of the priests bag
 and the other two ends of the chains were joined to the two frames and fixed to the front of the ephod over the arm holes
 and they made two rings of gold and put them on the two lower ends of the bag on the inner side nearest to the ephod
 and two other gold rings were put on the front of the ephod over the arm holes at the join and over the worked band
 and the rings on the bag were fixed to the rings of the ephod by a blue cord keeping it in place over the band so that the bag might not get loose as the lord gave orders to moses
 the robe which went with the ephod was made all of blue
 with a hole at the top in the middle like the hole in the coat of a fighting man edged with a band to make it strong
 the skirts of the robe were worked all round with fruits in blue and purple and red made of twisted linen
 and between the fruits all round the skirt they put gold bells as the lord gave orders to moses
 all round the skirt of the robe were bells and fruits in turn
 the coats for aaron and his sons they made of the best linen
 and the twisted head dress for aaron and beautiful head dresses of linen and linen trousers
 and a linen band worked with a design of blue and purple and red as the lord had said to moses
 the plate for the holy crown was made of the best gold and on it were cut these words holy to the lord
 it was fixed to the head dress by a blue cord as the lord had given orders to moses
 so all the work on the house of the tent of meeting was done as the lord had given orders to moses so the children of israel did it
 then they took the house to moses the tent with all the things for it its hooks its boards its rods its pillars and its bases
 the outer cover of sheepskins coloured red and the cover of leather and the veil for the doorway
 the ark of the law with its rods and its cover
 the table with all its vessels and the holy bread
 the support for the lights with the vessels for the lights to be put in their places on it and all its vessels and the oil for the lights
