 he was a trouble to israel all through the days of solomon and this is the damage hadad did he was cruel to israel while he was ruler over edom
 and there was jeroboam the son of nebat an ephraimite from zeredah a servant of solomon whose mother was zeruah a widow and his hand was lifted up against the king
 the way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this solomon was building the millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father david
 and jeroboam was an able and responsible man and solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of joseph
 now at that time when jeroboam was going out of jerusalem the prophet ahijah the shilonite came across him on the road now ahijah had put on a new robe and the two of them were by themselves in the open country
 and ahijah took his new robe in his hands parting it violently into twelve
 and he said to jeroboam take ten of the parts for this is what the lord has said see i will take the kingdom away from solomon by force and will give ten tribes to you
  but one tribe will be his because of my servant david and because of jerusalem the town which out of all the tribes of israel i have made mine 
 because they are turned away from me to the worship of ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and chemosh the god of moab and milcom the god of the ammonites they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws and my decisions as his father david did
 but i will not take the kingdom from him i will let him be king all the days of his life because of david my servant in whom i took delight because he kept my orders and my laws
 but i will take the kingdom from his son and give it to you
 and one tribe i will give to his son so that david my servant may have a light for ever burning before me in jerusalem the town which i have made mine to put my name there
 and you i will take and you will be king over israel ruling over whatever is the desire of your soul
 and if you give attention to the orders i give you walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as david my servant did then i will be with you building up for you a safe house as i did for david and i will give israel to you
  so that i may send trouble for this on the seed of david but not for ever 
 and solomon was looking for a chance to put jeroboam to death but he went in flight to egypt to shishak king of egypt and was in egypt till the death of solomon
 now the rest of the acts of solomon and all he did and his wisdom are they not recorded in the book of the acts of solomon
 and the time solomon was king in jerusalem over all israel was forty years
 and solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and solomon went to rest with his fathers and rehoboam his son became king in his place
 and rehoboam went to shechem where all israel had come together to make him king
 and hearing of it jeroboam the son of nebat who was still in egypt where he had gone in flight from solomon and was living there came back to his town zeredah in the hill country of ephraim
 and all the men of israel came to rehoboam and said
 your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
 and he said to them go away for three days and then come back to me again so the people went away
 then king rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with solomon his father when he was living and said in your opinion what answer am i to give to this people
 and they said to him if you will be a servant to this people today caring for them and giving them a gentle answer then they will be your servants for ever
 but he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men and went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
 and said to them what is your opinion what answer are we to give to this people who have said to me make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
 and the young men of his generation said to him this is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying your father put a hard yoke on us will you make it less say to them my little finger is thicker than my fathers body
 if my father put a hard yoke on you i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give you blows with snakes
