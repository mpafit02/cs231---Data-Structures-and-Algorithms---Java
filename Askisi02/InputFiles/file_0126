 of myself i am unable to do anything as the voice comes to me so i give a decision and my decision is right because i have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself but only what is pleasing to him who sent me
 if i gave witness about myself my witness would not be true
 there is another who gives witness about me and i am certain that the witness he gives about me is true
 you sent to john and he gave true witness
 but i have no need of a mans witness i only say these things so that you may have salvation
 he was a burning and shining light and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light
 but the witness which i have is greater than that of john the work which the father has given me to do the very work which i am now doing is a witness that the father has sent me
 and the father himself who sent me has given witness about me not one of you has ever given ear to his voice his form you have not seen
 and you have not kept his word in your hearts because you have not faith in him whom he has sent
 you make search in the holy writings in the belief that through them you get eternal life and it is those writings which give witness about me
 and still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life
 i do not take honour from men
 but i have knowledge of you that you have no love for god in your hearts
 i have come in my fathers name and your hearts are not open to me if another comes with no other authority but himself you will give him your approval
 how is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only god
 put out of your minds the thought that i will say things against you to the father the one who says things against you is moses on whom you put your hopes
 if you had belief in moses you would have belief in me for his writings are about me
 if you have no belief in his writings how will you have belief in my words
 after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee  that is the sea of tiberias
 and a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill
 then jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples
 now the passover a feast of the jews was near
 lifting up his eyes jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was and he said to philip where may we get bread for all these people
 this he said testing him for he had no doubt what he himself would do
 philip made answer bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little
 one of his disciples andrew the brother of simon peter said to jesus
 there is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes but what is that among such a number
 jesus said let the people be seated now there was much grass in that place and those seated on the grass were about five thousand
 then jesus took the cakes and having given praise to god he gave them to the people who were seated and the fishes in the same way as much as they had need of
 and when they had had enough jesus said to his disciples take up the broken bits which are over so that nothing may be wasted
