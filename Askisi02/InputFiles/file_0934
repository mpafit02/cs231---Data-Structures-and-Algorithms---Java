 the bread of evil doing is their food the wine of violent acts their drink
 but the way of the upright is like the light of early morning getting brighter and brighter till the full day
 the way of sinners is dark they see not the cause of their fall
 my son give attention to my words let your ear be turned to my sayings
 let them not go from your eyes keep them deep in your heart
 for they are life to him who gets them and strength to all his flesh
 and keep watch over your heart with all care so you will have life
 put away from you an evil tongue and let false lips be far from you
 keep your eyes on what is in front of you looking straight before you
 keep a watch on your behaviour let all your ways be rightly ordered
 let there be no turning to the right or to the left keep your feet from evil
 my son give attention to my wisdom let your ear be turned to my teaching
 so that you may be ruled by a wise purpose and your lips may keep knowledge
 for honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman and her mouth is smoother than oil
 but her end is bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two edged sword
 her feet go down to death and her steps to the underworld
 she never keeps her mind on the road of life her ways are uncertain she has no knowledge
 give ear to me then my sons and do not put away my words from you
 go far away from her do not come near the door of her house
 for fear that you may give your honour to others and your wealth to strange men
 and strange men may be full of your wealth and the fruit of your work go to the house of others
 and you will be full of grief at the end of your life when your flesh and your body are wasted
 and you will say how was teaching hated by me and my heart put no value on training
 i did not give attention to the voice of my teachers my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me 
 i was in almost all evil in the company of the people
 let water from your store and not that of others be your drink and running water from your fountain
 let not your springs be flowing in the streets or your streams of water in the open places
 let them be for yourself only not for other men with you
 let blessing be on your fountain have joy in the wife of your early years
 as a loving hind and a gentle doe let her breasts ever give you rapture let your passion at all times be moved by her love
