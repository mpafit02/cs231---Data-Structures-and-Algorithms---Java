 and he would not let any man take a vessel through the temple
 and he gave them teaching and said to them is it not in the writings my house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations but you have made it a hole of thieves
 and it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes and they took thought how they might put him to death being in fear of him because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching
 and every evening he went out of the town
 and when they were going by in the morning they saw the fig tree dead from the roots
 and peter having a memory of it said to him master see the tree which was cursed by you is dead
 and jesus answering said to them have gods faith
 truly i say to you whoever says to this mountain be taken up and be put into the sea and has no doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says will come about he will have his desire
 for this reason i say to you whatever you make a request for in prayer have faith that it has been given to you and you will have it
 and whenever you make a prayer let there be forgiveness in your hearts if you have anything against anyone so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your father who is in heaven
   
 and they came again to jerusalem and while he was walking in the temple there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
 and they said to him by what authority do you do these things or who gave you authority to do these things
 and jesus said to them i will put to you one question give me an answer and i will say by what authority i do these things
 the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men give me an answer
 and they gave thought to it among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not have faith in him
 but if we say from men  they were in fear of the people because all took john to be truly a prophet
 and they said in answer to jesus we have no idea and jesus said to them and i will not say to you by what authority i do these things
 and he gave them teaching in the form of stories a man had a vine garden planted and put a wall about it and made a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower and let it out to field workers and went into another country
 and when the time came he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden
 and they took him and gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
 and again he sent to them another servant and they gave him wounds on the head and were very cruel to him
 and he sent another and they put him to death and a number of others whipping some and putting some to death
 he still had one a dearly loved son he sent him last to them saying they will have respect for my son
 but those workmen said among themselves this is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
 and they took him and put him to death pushing his body out of the garden
 what then will the master of the garden do he will come and put the workmen to death and will give the garden into the hands of others
 have you not seen this which is in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same was made the chief stone of the building
 this was the lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
 and they made attempts to take him but they were in fear of the people because they saw that the story was against them and they went away from him
