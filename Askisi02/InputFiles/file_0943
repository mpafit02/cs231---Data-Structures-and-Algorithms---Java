 let my thoughts be sweet to him i will be glad in the lord
 let sinners be cut off from the earth and let all evil doers come to an end give praise to the lord o my soul give praise to the lord
 o give praise to the lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
 let your voice be sounding in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
 have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the lord be glad
 let your search be for the lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
 keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
 o you seed of abraham his servant you children of jacob his loved ones
 he is the lord our god he is judge of all the earth
 he has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
 the agreement which he made with abraham and his oath to isaac
 and he gave it to jacob for a law and to israel for an eternal agreement
 saying to you will i give the land of canaan the measured line of your heritage
 when they were still small in number and strange in the land
 when they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
 he would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
 saying put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
 and he took away all food from the land so that the people were without bread
 he sent a man before them even joseph who was given as a servant for a price
 his feet were fixed in chains his neck was put in iron bands
 till the time when his word came true he was tested by the word of the lord
 the king sent men to take off his chains even the ruler of the people who let him go free
 he made him lord of his house and ruler over everything he had
 to give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure and so that his law givers might get wisdom from him
 then israel came into egypt and jacob was living in the land of ham
 and his people were greatly increased and became stronger than those who were against them
 their hearts were turned to hate against his people so that they made secret designs against them
 he sent moses his servant and aaron the man of his selection
 he let his signs be seen among the people and his wonders in the land of ham
 he sent black night and made it dark and they did not go against his word
