 for the lord will be your hope and will keep your foot from being taken in the net
 do not keep back good from those who have a right to it when it is in the power of your hand to do it
 say not to your neighbour go and come again and tomorrow i will give when you have it by you at the time
 do not make evil designs against your neighbour when he is living with you without fear
 do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing if he has done you no wrong
 have no envy of the violent man or take any of his ways as an example
 for the wrong hearted man is hated by the lord but he is a friend to the upright
 the curse of the lord is on the house of the evil doer but his blessing is on the tent of the upright
 he makes sport of the men of pride but he gives grace to the gentle hearted
 the wise will have glory for their heritage but shame will be the reward of the foolish
 the words of agur the son of jakeh from massa the man says i am full of weariness o god i am full of weariness o god i have come to an end
 for i am more like a beast than any man i have no power of reasoning like a man
 i have not got wisdom by teaching so that i might have the knowledge of the holy one
 who has gone up to heaven and come down who has taken the winds in his hands prisoning the waters in his robe by whom have all the ends of the earth been fixed what is his name and what is his sons name if you are able to say
 every word of god is tested he is a breastplate to those who put their faith in him
 make no addition to his words or he will make clear your error and you will be seen to be false
 i have made request to you for two things do not keep them from me before my death
 put far from me all false and foolish things do not give me great wealth or let me be in need but give me only enough food
 for fear that if i am full i may be false to you and say who is the lord or if i am poor i may become a thief using the name of my god wrongly
 do not say evil of a servant to his master or he will put a curse on you and you will get into trouble
 there is a generation who put a curse on their father and do not give a blessing to their mother
 there is a generation who seem to themselves to be free from sin but are not washed from their unclean ways
 there is a generation o how full of pride are their eyes  o how their brows are lifted up 
 there is a generation whose teeth are like swords their strong teeth like knives for the destruction of the poor from the earth and of those who are in need from among men
 the night spirit has two daughters give give there are three things which are never full even four which never say enough
 the underworld and the woman without a child the earth which never has enough water and the fire which never says enough
 the eye which makes sport of a father and sees no value in a mother when she is old will be rooted out by the ravens of the valley and be food for the young eagles
 there are three things the wonder of which overcomes me even four things outside my knowledge
 the way of an eagle in the air the way of a snake on a rock the way of a ship in the heart of the sea and the way of a man with a girl
 this is the way of a false wife she takes food and cleaning her mouth says i have done no wrong
