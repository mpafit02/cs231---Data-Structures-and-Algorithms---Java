 but i am certain that he who will take up my cause is living and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust
 and  without my flesh i will see god
 whom i will see on my side and not as one strange to me my heart is broken with desire
 if you say how cruel we will be to him  because the root of sin is clearly in him
 be in fear of the sword for the sword is the punishment for such things so that you may be certain that there is a judge
 and there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the lord and the satan came with them
 and the lord said to the satan where do you come from and the satan said in answer from wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
 and the lord said to the satan have you taken note of my servant job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil and he still keeps his righteousness though you have been moving me to send destruction on him without cause
 and the satan said in answer to the lord skin for skin all a man has he will give for his life
 but now if you only put your hand on his bone and his flesh he will certainly be cursing you to your face
 and the lord said to the satan see he is in your hands only do not take his life
 and the satan went out from before the lord and sent on job an evil disease covering his skin from his feet to the top of his head
 and he took a broken bit of a pot and seated in the dust was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it
 and his wife said to him are you still keeping your righteousness say a curse against god and put an end to yourself
 and he said to her you are talking like one of the foolish women if we take the good god sends us are we not to take the evil when it comes in all this job kept his lips from sin
 and jobs three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him and they came every one from his place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite so they came together to a meeting place in order that they might go and make clear to job their grief for him and give him comfort
 and lifting up their eyes when they were still far off it did not seem that the man they saw was job because of the change in him and they gave way to bitter weeping with signs of grief and put dust on their heads
 and they took their seats on the earth by his side for seven days and seven nights but no one said a word to him for they saw that his pain was very great
 then zophar the naamathite made answer and said
 for this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on
 i have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame and your answers to me are wind without wisdom
 have you knowledge of this from early times when man was placed on the earth
 that the pride of the sinner is short and the joy of the evil doer but for a minute
 though he is lifted up to the heavens and his head goes up to the clouds
 like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever those who have seen him say where is he
 he is gone like a dream and is not seen again he goes in flight like a vision of the night
 the eye which saw him sees him no longer and his place has no more knowledge of him
 his children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them and his hands give back his wealth
 his bones are full of young strength but it will go down with him into the dust
 though evil doing is sweet in his mouth and he keeps it secretly under his tongue
