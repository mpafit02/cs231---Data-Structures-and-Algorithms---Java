 no one is pushing against another everyone goes straight on his way bursting through the sword points their order is not broken
 they make a rush on the town running on the wall they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief
 the earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking the sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
 and the lord is thundering before his forces for very great is his army for he is strong who gives effect to his word for the day of the lord is great and greatly to be feared and who has strength against it
 but even now says the lord come back to me with all your heart keeping from food with weeping and with sorrow
 let your hearts be broken and not your clothing and come back to the lord your god for he is full of grace and pity slow to be angry and great in mercy ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment
 may it not be that he will again let his purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him even a meal offering and a drink offering for the lord your god
 let a horn be sounded in zion let a time be fixed for going without food have a holy meeting
 get the people together make the mass of the people holy send for the old men get together the children and babies at the breast let the newly married man come out of his room and the bride from her tent
 let the priests the servants of the lord be weeping between the covered way and the altar and let them say have mercy on your people o lord do not give up your heritage to shame so that the nations become their rulers why let them say among the peoples where is their god
 then the lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people
 and the lord made answer and said to his people see i will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure and i will no longer let you be shamed among the nations
 i will send the one from the north far away from you driving him into a dry and waste land with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west and the smell of him will go up even his evil smell will go up
 have no fear o land be glad with great joy for the lord has done great things
 have no fear you beasts of the field for the grass lands of the waste are becoming green for the trees are producing fruit the fig tree and the vine give out their strength
 be glad then you children of zion and have joy in the lord your god for he gives you food in full measure making the rain come down for you the early and the late rain as at the first
 and the floors will be full of grain and the crushing places overflowing with wine and oil
 i will give back to you the years which were food for the locust the plant worm the field fly and the worm my great army which i sent among you
 you will have food in full measure and give praise to the name of the lord your god who has done wonders for you
 and you will be certain that i am in israel and that i am the lord your god and there is no other and my people will never be shamed
 and after that it will come about says the lord that i will send my spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets your old men will have dreams your young men will see visions
 and on the servants and the servant girls in those days i will send my spirit
 and i will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke
 the sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood before the great day of the lord comes a day to be feared
 and it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the lord will be kept safe for in mount zion and in jerusalem some will be kept safe as the lord has said and will be among the small band marked out by the lord
 for in those days and in that time when i let the fate of judah and jerusalem be changed
 i will get together all the nations and make them come down into the valley of jehoshaphat and there i will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage israel whom they have sent wandering among the nations and of my land which has been parted by them
 and they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine
 and further what are you to me o tyre and zidon and all the circle of philistia will you give me back any payment and if you do quickly and suddenly i will send it back on your head
 for you have taken my silver and my gold putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things
