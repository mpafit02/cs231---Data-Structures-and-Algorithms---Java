 and moses said why are you now acting against the lords order seeing that no good will come of it
 go not up for the lord is not with you and you will be overcome by those who are fighting against you
 for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and you will be put to death by their swords because you have gone back from the way of the lord the lord will not be with you
 but they gave no attention to his words and went to the top of the mountain though moses and the ark of the lords agreement did not go out of the tent circle
 then the amalekites came down and the canaanites who were living in the hill country and overcame them completely driving them back as far as hormah
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you have come into the land which i am giving to you for your resting place
 and are going to make an offering by fire to the lord a burned offering or an offering in connection with an oath or an offering freely given or at your regular feasts an offering for a sweet smell to the lord from the herd or the flock
 then let him who is making his offering give to the lord a meal offering of a tenth part of a measure of the best meal mixed with a fourth part of a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering you are to give with the burned offering or other offering the fourth part of a hin of wine for every lamb
 or for a male sheep give as a meal offering two tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with a third part of a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering give a third part of a hin of wine for a sweet smell to the lord
 and when you make ready a young ox for a burned or other offering or for the effecting of an oath or for peace offerings to the lord
 then with the ox give a meal offering of three tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with half a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering give half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the lord
 this is to be done for every young ox and for every male sheep or he lamb or young goat
 whatever number you make ready so you are to do for every one
 all those who are israelites by birth are to do these things in this way when giving an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the lord
 and if a man from another country or any other person living among you through all your generations has the desire to give an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the lord let him do as you do
 there is to be one law for you and for the man of another country living with you one law for ever from generation to generation as you are so is he to be before the lord
 the law and the rule are to be the same for you and for those from other lands living with you
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you come into the land where i am guiding you
 then when you take for your food the produce of the land you are to give an offering lifted up before the lord
 of the first of your rough meal you are to give a cake for a lifted offering lifting it up before the lord as the offering of the grain floor is lifted up
 from generation to generation you are to give to the lord a lifted offering from the first of your rough meal
 and if in error you go against any of these laws which the lord has given to moses
 all the laws which the lord has given you by the hand of moses from the day when the lord gave them and ever after from generation to generation
 then if the wrong is done in error without the knowledge of the meeting of the people let all the meeting give a young ox as a burned offering a sweet smell to the lord with its meal offering and its drink offering as is ordered in the law together with a he goat for a sin offering
 so the priest will make the people free from sin and they will have forgiveness for it was an error and they have given their offering made by fire to the lord and their sin offering before the lord on account of their error
