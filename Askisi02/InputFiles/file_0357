 and micaiah said if you come back at all in peace the lord has not sent his word by me
 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will make a change in my clothing so that i do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes so the king of israel made a change in his dress and they went to the fight
 now the king of aram had given orders to the captains of his war carriages saying make no attack on small or great but only on the king of israel
 so when the captains of the war carriages saw jehoshaphat they said it is the king of israel and turning about they came round him but jehoshaphat gave a cry and the lord came to his help and god sent them away from him
 now when the captains of the war carriages saw that he was not the king of israel they went back from going after him
 and a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his war carriage go to one side and take me away out of the army for i am badly wounded
 but the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king of israel was supported in his war carriage facing the aramaeans till the evening and by sundown he was dead
 and jehoshaphat king of judah went back to his house in jerusalem in peace
 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went to king jehoshaphat and said to him is it right for you to go to the help of evil doers loving the haters of the lord because of this the wrath of the lord has come on you
 but still there is some good in you for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land and have given your heart to the worship of god
 and jehoshaphat was living in jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beer sheba to the hill country of ephraim guiding them back to the lord the god of their fathers
 and he put judges through all the land in every walled town of judah
 and said to the judges take care what you do for you are judging not for man but for the lord and he is with you in the decisions you give
 so now let the fear of the lord be in you do your work with care for in the lord our god there is no evil or respect for high position or taking of payment to do wrong
 then in jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the levites and the priests and the heads of families of israel to give decisions for the lord and in the causes of those living in jerusalem
 and he gave them their orders saying you are to do your work in the fear of the lord in good faith and with a true heart
 and if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns where the death punishment is in question or where there are questions of law or order or rules or decisions make them take care that they are not in the wrong before the lord so that wrath may not come on you and on your brothers do this and you yourselves will not be in the wrong
 and now amariah the chief priest is over you in all questions to do with the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the head of the family of judah in everything to do with the kings business and the levites will be overseers for you be strong to do the work and may the lord be with the upright
 now it was solomons purpose to put up a house for the name of the lord and a house for himself as king
 and solomon had seventy thousand men numbered for transport and eighty thousand for cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers
 and solomon sent to huram king of tyre saying as you did for my father david sending him cedar trees for the building of his house
 see  i am building a house for the name of the lord my god to be made holy to him where perfumes of sweet spices will be burned before him and the holy bread will be placed at all times and burned offerings will be offered morning and evening on the sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts of the lord our god this is a law for ever to israel
 and the house which i am building is to be great for our god is greater than all gods
 but who may have strength enough to make a house for him seeing that the heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be his resting place who am i then to make a house for him but i am building it only for the burning of perfume before him
 so now send me an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in purple and red and blue and in the cutting of all sorts of ornament to be with the expert workmen who are here in judah and in jerusalem whom my father david got together
 and send me cedar trees cypress trees and sandal wood from lebanon for to my knowledge your servants are expert wood cutters in lebanon and my servants will be with yours
 to get trees for me in great numbers for the house which i am building is to be great and a wonder
 and i will give as food to your servants the wood cutters twenty thousand measures of grain and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil
 then huram king of tyre sent solomon an answer in writing saying because of his love for his people the lord has made you king over them
