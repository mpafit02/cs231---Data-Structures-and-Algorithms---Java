 your neck is as a tower of ivory your eyes like the waters in heshbon by the doorway of bath rabbim your nose is as the tower on lebanon looking over damascus
 your head is like carmel and the hair of your head is like purple in whose net the king is prisoner
 how beautiful and how sweet you are o love for delight
 you are tall like a palm tree and your breasts are like the fruit of the vine
 i said let me go up the palm tree and let me take its branches in my hands your breasts will be as the fruit of the vine and the smell of your breath like apples
 and the roof of your mouth like good wine flowing down smoothly for my loved one moving gently over my lips and my teeth
 i am for my loved one and his desire is for me
 come my loved one let us go out into the field let us take rest among the cypress trees
 let us go out early to the vine gardens let us see if the vine is in bud if it has put out its young fruit and the pomegranate is in flower there i will give you my love
 the mandrakes give out a sweet smell and at our doors are all sorts of good fruits new and old which i have kept for my loved one
 oh that you were my brother who took milk from my mothers breasts  when i came to you in the street i would give you kisses yes i would not be looked down on
 i would take you by the hand into my mothers house and she would be my teacher i would give you drink of spiced wine drink of the pomegranate
 his left hand would be under my head and his right hand about me
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem do not let love be moved till it is ready
 who is this who comes up from the waste places resting on her loved one it was i who made you awake under the apple tree where your mother gave you birth there she was in pain at your birth
 put me as a sign on your heart as a sign on your arm love is strong as death and wrath bitter as the underworld its coals are coals of fire violent are its flames
 much water may not put out love or the deep waters overcome it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be judged a price not great enough
 we have a young sister and she has no breasts what are we to do for our sister in the day when she is given to a man
 if she is a wall we will make on her a strong base of silver and if she is a door we will let her be shut up with cedar wood
 i am a wall and my breasts are like towers then was i in his eyes as one to whom good chance had come
 solomon had a vine garden at baal hamon he let out the vine garden to keepers every one had to give a thousand bits of silver for its fruit
 my vine garden which is mine is before me you o solomon will have the thousand and those who keep the fruit of them two hundred
 you who have your resting place in the gardens the friends give ear to your voice make me give ear to it
 come quickly my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of spice
 in the eighth month in the second year of darius the word of the lord came to zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
 the lord has been very angry with your fathers
 and you are to say to them these are the words of the lord of armies come back to me says the lord of armies and i will come back to you
 be not like your fathers to whom the voice of the earlier prophets came saying be turned now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not give ear to me or take note says the lord
 your fathers where are they and the prophets do they go on living for ever
 but my words and my orders which i gave to my servants the prophets have they not overtaken your fathers and turning back they said as it was the purpose of the lord of armies to do to us in reward for our ways and our doings so has he done
