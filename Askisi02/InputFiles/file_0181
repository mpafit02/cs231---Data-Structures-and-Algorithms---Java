 and while they were taking food he took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to them and said take it this is my body
 and he took a cup and when he had given praise he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it
 and he said to them this is my blood of the testament which is given for men
 truly i say to you i will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when i take it new in the kingdom of god
 and after a song of praise to god they went out to the mountain of olives
 and jesus said to them you will all be turned away from me for it is in the writings i will put the keeper of the sheep to death and the sheep will be put to flight
 but after i have come back from the dead i will go before you into galilee
 but peter said to him though the others may be turned away from you i will not
 and jesus said to him truly i say to you that you today even this night before the cocks second cry will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 but he said with passion if i have to be put to death with you i will not be false to you and they all said the same
 and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he said to his disciples be seated here while i say a prayer
 and he took with him peter and james and john and grief and great trouble came on him
 and he said to them my soul is very sad even to death be here a little time and keep watch
 and he went forward a little and falling down on the earth made request that if possible the hour might go from him
 and he said abba father all things are possible to you take away this cup from me but even so let not my pleasure but yours be done
 and he came and saw them sleeping and said to peter simon are you sleeping were you not able to keep watch one hour
 keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
 and again he went away and said a prayer using the same words
 and again he came and saw them sleeping because their eyes were very tired and they had nothing to say in answer
 and he came the third time and said to them go on sleeping now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come see the son of man is given up into the hands of evil men
 get up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
 and straight away while he was still talking judas one of the twelve came and with him a great band with swords and sticks from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
 now he who had been false to him had given them a sign saying the one to whom i give a kiss that is he take him and get him away safely
 and when he had come he went straight to him and said master and gave him a kiss
 and they put their hands on him and took him
 but a certain one of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
 and jesus said to them have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me
 i was with you every day in the temple teaching and you did not take me but this is done so that the writings may come true
 and they all went away from him in fear
 and a certain young man went after him with only a linen cloth about his body and they put their hands on him
