 but they said nothing and he made him well and sent him away
 and he said to them which of you whose ox or ass has got into a water hole will not straight away get him out on the sabbath
 and they had no answer to that question
 and he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast when he saw how they took the best seats saying to them
 when you get a request to come to a feast do not take the best seat for a more important man than you may be coming
 and then the giver of the feast will come to you and say give your place to this man and you with shame will have to take the lowest seat
 but when you come go and take the lowest seat so that when the giver of the feast comes he may say to you friend come up higher and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there
 for every man who gives himself a high place will be put down but he who takes a low place will be lifted up
 and he said to the master of the house when you give a feast do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth for they may give a feast for you and so you will get a reward
 but when you give a feast send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body
 and you will have a blessing because they will not be able to give you any payment and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead
 and hearing these words one of those who were at table with him said to him happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of god
 and he said to them a certain man gave a great feast and sent word of it to a number of people
 and when the time had come he sent his servants to say to them come for all things are now ready
 and they all gave reasons why they were not able to come the first said to him i have got a new field and it is necessary for me to go and see it i am full of regret that i am unable to come
 and another said i have got some cattle and i am going to make a test of them i am full of regret that i am unable to come
 and another said i have been married and so i am not able to come
 and the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor the blind and those who are broken in body
 and the servant said lord your orders have been done and still there is room
 and the lord said to the servant go out into the roads and the fields and make them come in so that my house may be full
 for i say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast
 now a great number of people went with him
 and turning round he said to them if any man comes to me and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and even for his life he may not be my disciple
 whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple
 for which of you desiring to put up a tower does not first give much thought to the price if he will have enough to make it complete
 for fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end all who see it will be laughing at him
 and saying this man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete
 or what king going to war with another king will not first take thought if he will be strong enough with ten thousand men to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand
 or while the other is still a great distance away he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace
 and so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple
