 and as for the ten horns out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power and after them another will come up he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings
 and he will say words against the most high attempting to put an end to the saints of the most high and he will have the idea of changing times and law and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time
 but the judge will be seated and they will put an end to his authority to overcome it and send complete destruction on it
 and the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the most high his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure
 here is the end of the account as for me daniel i was greatly troubled by my thoughts and the colour went from my face but i kept the thing in my heart
 in the third year of the rule of belshazzar the king a vision was seen by me daniel after the one i saw at first
 and i saw in the vision and when i saw it i was in the strong town shushan which is in the country of elam and in the vision i was by the water door of the ulai
 and lifting up my eyes i saw there before the stream a male sheep with two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other the higher one coming up last
 i saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south and no beasts were able to keep their place before him and no one was able to get people out of his power but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great
 and while i was giving thought to this i saw a he goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth and the he goat had a great horn between his eyes
 and he came to the two horned sheep which i saw before the stream rushing at him in the heat of his power
 and i saw him come right up to the sheep and he was moved with wrath against him attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power
 and the he goat became very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven
 and out of one of them came another horn a little one which became very great stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land
 and it became great even as high as the army of heaven pulling down some of the army even of the stars to the earth and crushing them under its feet
 it made itself great even as great as the lord of the army and by it the regular burned offering was taken away and the place overturned and the holy place made waste
  against the regular burned offering and  crushed down to the earth and it did its pleasure and things went well for it
 then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking how long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away and the unclean thing causing fear is put up and the holy place crushed under foot
 and he said to him for two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings then the holy place will be made clean
 and it came about that when i daniel had seen this vision i had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded and i saw one before me in the form of a man
 and the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the ulai crying out and saying gabriel make the vision clear to this man
 so he came and took his place near where i was and when he came i was full of fear and went down on my face but he said to me let it be clear to you o son of man for the vision has to do with the time of the end
 now while he was talking to me i went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth but touching me he put me on my feet where i had been
 and he said see i will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath for it has to do with the fixed time of the end
 the sheep which you saw with two horns they are the kings of media and persia
 and the he goat is the king of greece and the great horn between his eyes is the first king
 and as for that which was broken in place of which four came up four kingdoms will come up from his nation but not with his power
 and in the later years of their kingdom when their evil doings have become complete there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings
 and his power will be great and he will be purposing strange things and all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure and he will send destruction on the strong ones
 and his designs will be turned against the holy people causing deceit to do well in his hand in his heart he will make himself great and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger and he will put himself up against the prince of princes but he will be broken though not by mens hands
