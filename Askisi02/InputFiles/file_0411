 and the king gave orders to joab and abishai and ittai saying because of me be gentle to the young man absalom and this order about absalom was given in the hearing of all the people
 so the people went out into the field against israel and the fight took place in the woods of ephraim
 and the people of israel were overcome there by the servants of david and there was a great destruction that day and twenty thousand men were put to the sword
 and the fighting went on over all the face of the country and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword
 and absalom came across some of davids men and absalom was seated on his mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven and the beast under him went on
 and a certain man saw it and said to joab i saw absalom hanging in a tree
 and joab said to the man who had given him the news if you saw this why did you not put your sword through him and i would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe
 and the man said to joab even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver i would not put out my hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and abishai and ittai saying take care that the young man absalom is not touched
 and if i had falsely put him to death  and nothing may be kept secret from the king  you would have had nothing to do with me
 then joab said i would have made it safe for you and he took three spears in his hand and put them through absaloms heart while he was still living in the branches of the tree
 and ten young men servants of joab came round absalom and put an end to him
 and joab had the horn sounded and the people came back from going after israel for joab kept them back
 and they took absaloms body and put it into a great hole in the wood and put a great mass of stones over it and every man of israel went in flight to his tent
 now absalom before his death had put up for himself a pillar in the kings valley naming it after himself for he said i have no son to keep my name in memory and to this day it is named absaloms pillar
 then ahimaaz the son of zadok said let me go and give the king news of how the lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him
 and joab said you will take no news today another day you may give him the news but you will take no news today because the kings son is dead
 then joab said to the cushite go and give the king word of what you have seen and the cushite making a sign of respect to joab went off running
 then ahimaaz the son of zadok said to joab again whatever may come of it let me go after the cushite and joab said why have you a desire to go my son seeing that you will get no reward for your news
 whatever may come of it he said i will go then he said to him go so ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the cushite
 now david was seated between the two town doors and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways on the wall and lifting up his eyes saw a man running by himself
 and the watchman gave news of it to the king and the king said if he is coming by himself then he has news and the man was travelling quickly and came near
 then the watchman saw another man running and crying out in the direction of the door he said here is another man running by himself and the king said he like the other comes with news
 and the watchman said it seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and his news will be good
 and ahimaaz crying out to the king said it is well and falling down before the king with his face to the earth he said may the lord your god be praised who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king 
 and the king said is it well with the young man absalom and ahimaaz said in answer when joab sent me your servant i saw a great outcry going on but i had no knowledge of what it was
 and the king said get back and take your place here so turning to one side he took his place there
 and then the cushite came and said i have news for my lord the king today the lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you
 and the king said to the cushite is the young man absalom safe and the cushite said in answer may all the kings haters and those who do evil against the king be as that young man is 
 then the king was much moved and went up into the room over the door weeping and saying o my son absalom my son my son absalom  if only my life might have been given for yours o absalom my son my son 
 and word was given to joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for absalom
