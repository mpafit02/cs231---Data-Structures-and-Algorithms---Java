 his sons come to honour and he has no knowledge of it they are made low but he is not conscious of it
 only his flesh still has pain and his soul is sad
 and eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value or will he give birth to the east wind
 will he make arguments with words in which is no profit and with sayings which have no value
 truly you make the fear of god without effect so that the time of quiet worship before god is made less by your outcry
 for your mouth is guided by your sin and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself
 it is by your mouth even yours that you are judged to be in the wrong and not by me and your lips give witness against you
 were you the first man to come into the world or did you come into being before the hills
 were you present at the secret meeting of god and have you taken all wisdom for yourself
 what knowledge have you which we have not is there anything in your mind which is not in ours
 with us are men who are grey haired and full of years much older than your father
 are the comforts of god not enough for you and the gentle word which was said to you
 why is your heart uncontrolled and why are your eyes lifted up
 so that you are turning your spirit against god and letting such words go out of your mouth
 what is man that he may be clean and how may the son of woman be upright
 truly he puts no faith in his holy ones and the heavens are not clean in his eyes
 how much less one who is disgusting and unclean a man who takes in evil like water 
 take note and give ear to my words and i will say what i have seen
  the things which wise men have got from their fathers and have not kept secret from us
 for only to them was the land given and no strange people were among them 
 the evil man is in pain all his days and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small
 a sound of fear is in his ears in time of peace destruction will come on him
 he has no hope of coming safe out of the dark and his fate will be the sword
 he is wandering about in search of bread saying where is it and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him
 he is greatly in fear of the dark day trouble and pain overcome him
 because his hand is stretched out against god and his heart is lifted up against the ruler of all
 running against him like a man of war covered by his thick breastplate even like a king ready for the fight
 because his face is covered with fat and his body has become thick
 and he has made his resting place in the towns which have been pulled down in houses where no man had a right to be whose fate was to become masses of broken walls
