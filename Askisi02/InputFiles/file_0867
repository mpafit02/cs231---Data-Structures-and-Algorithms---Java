 now in the second year on the twentieth day of the second month the cloud was taken up from over the tent of witness
 and the children of israel went on their journey out of the waste land of sinai and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of paran
 they went forward for the first time on their journey as the lord had given orders by the hand of moses
 first the flag of the children of judah went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was nahshon the son of amminadab
 and at the head of the army of the children of issachar was nethanel the son of zuar
 and at the head of the army of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon
 then the house was taken down and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari who were responsible for moving the house went forward
 then the flag of the children of reuben went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was elizur the son of shedeur
 and at the head of the army of the children of simeon was shelumiel the son of zurishaddai
 at the head of the army of the children of gad was eliasaph the son of reuel
 then the kohathites went forward with the holy place the others put up the house ready for their coming
 then the flag of the children of ephraim went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was elishama the son of ammihud
 at the head of the army of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur
 at the head of the army of the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni
 and the flag of the children of dan whose tents were moved last of all went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai
 at the head of the army of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ochran
 and at the head of the army of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan
 this was the order in which the children of israel were journeying by armies so they went forward
 then moses said to hobab the son of his father in law reuel the midianite we are journeying to that place of which the lord has said i will give it to you so come with us and it will be for your profit for the lord has good things in store for israel
 but he said i will not go with you i will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations
 and he said do not go from us for you will be eyes for us guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents
 and if you come with us we will give you a part in whatever good the lord does for us
 so they went forward three days journey from the mountain of the lord and the ark of the lords agreement went three days journey before them looking for a resting place for them
 and by day the cloud of the lord went over them when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents
 and when the ark went forward moses said come up o lord and let the armies of those who are against you be broken and let your haters go in flight before you
 and when it came to rest he said take rest o lord and give a blessing to the families of israel
 now the people were saying evil against the lord and the lord hearing it was angry and sent fire on them burning the outer parts of the tent circle
 and the people made an outcry to moses and moses made prayer to the lord and the fire was stopped
 so that place was named taberah because of the fire of the lord which had been burning among them
 and the mixed band of people who went with them were overcome by desire and the children of israel weeping again said who will give us flesh for our food
