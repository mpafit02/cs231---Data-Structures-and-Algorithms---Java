 and when his servant saw that saul was dead he did the same and came to his death
 so death overtook saul and his three sons all his family came to an end together
 and when all the men of israel who were in the valley saw that the men of israel had gone in flight and that saul and his sons were dead they went in flight away from their towns and the philistines came and took them for themselves
 now the day after when the philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw saul and his sons dead in mount gilboa
 and they took everything off him and took his head and his war dress and sent word into the land of the philistines round about to give the news to their gods and to the people
 and they put his war dress in the house of their gods and put up his head in the house of dagon
 and when the news came to jabesh gilead of what the philistines had done to saul
 all the fighting men came up and took away sauls body and the bodies of his sons and took them to jabesh and put their bones to rest under the oak tree in jabesh and took no food for seven days
 so death came to saul because of the sin which he did against the lord that is because of the word of the lord which he kept not and because he went for directions to one who had an evil spirit
 and not to the lord for this reason he put him to death and gave the kingdom to david the son of jesse
 then all israel came together to david at hebron and said truly we are your bone and your flesh
 in the past when saul was king it was you who went at the head of israel when they went out or came in and the lord your god said to you you are to be the keeper of my people israel and their ruler
 so all the responsible men of israel came to the king at hebron and david made an agreement with them in hebron before the lord and they put the holy oil on david and made him king over israel as the lord had said by samuel
 then david and all israel went to jerusalem  which is jebus  and the jebusites the people of the land were there
 and the people of jebus said to david you will not come in here but still david took the strong place of zion which is the town of david
 and david said the first to overcome the jebusites will be chief and captain and joab the son of zeruiah went up first and became chief
 and david took the strong tower for his living place so it was named the town of david
 and he took in hand the building of the town all round starting from the millo and joab put the rest of the town in order
 and david became greater and greater in power because the lord of armies was with him
 now these are the chief of davids men of war who were his strong supporters in the kingdom and with all israel made him king as the lord had said about israel
 this is the list of davids men of war ishbaal the son of a hachmonite the chief of the three he put to death three hundred at one time with his spear
 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three great fighters
 he was with david at pas dammim where the philistines had come together for the fight near a bit of land full of barley and the people went in flight before the philistines
 and he took up his position in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the philistines and the lord gave a great salvation
 and three of the thirty went down to david to the rock into the strong place of adullam and the army of the philistines had taken up their position in the valley of rephaim
 at that time david had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the philistines was in beth lehem
 and david moved by a strong desire said if only someone would give me a drink of the water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town 
 so the three forcing a way through the philistine army got water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to david but david would not take it but made an offering of it draining it out to the lord
 saying by my god far be it from me to do this  how may i take as drink the life blood of these men who have put their lives in danger so he did not take it these things did the three great men of war
 and abishai the brother of joab was chief of the thirty for he put to death three hundred with his spear but he had not a name among the three
