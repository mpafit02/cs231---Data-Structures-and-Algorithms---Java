 these are the laws which the lord gave moses in relation to a man and his wife or a father and a young daughter who is under his authority
 then the lord said to moses
 give the midianites punishment for the wrong they did to the children of israel and after that you will go to rest with your people
 so moses said to the people let men from among you be armed for war to put into effect against midian the lords punishment on them
 from every tribe of israel send a thousand to the war
 so from the thousands of israel a thousand were taken from every tribe twelve thousand men armed for war
 and moses sent them out to war a thousand from every tribe and with them phinehas the son of eleazar the priest taking in his hands the vessels of the holy place and the horns for sounding the note of war
 and they made war on midian as the lord gave orders to moses and they put to death every male
 they put the kings of midian to death with the rest evi and reken and zur and hur and reba the five kings of midian and balaam the son of beor they put to death with the sword
 the women of midian with their little ones the children of israel took prisoner and all their cattle and flocks and all their goods they took for themselves
 and after burning all their towns and all their tent circles
 they went away with the goods they had taken man and beast
 and the prisoners and the goods and everything they had taken they took to moses and eleazar the priest and the people of israel to the tent circle in the lowlands of moab by the jordan at jericho
 then moses and eleazar the priest and the chiefs of the people went out to them before they had come into the tent circle
 and moses was angry with the chiefs of the army the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who had come back from the war
 and moses said to them why have you kept all the women safe
 it was these who moved by balaam were the cause of israels sin against the lord in the question of peor because of which disease came on the people of the lord
 so now put every male child to death and every woman who has had sex relations with a man
 but all the female children who have had no sex relations with men you may keep for yourselves
 you yourselves will have to keep outside the tent circle for seven days anyone of you who has put any person to death or come near a dead body and on the third day and on the seventh day make yourselves and your prisoners clean
 and every bit of clothing and anything made of leather or goats hair or wood you are to make clean
 then eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had been to the fight this is the rule of the law which the lord has given to moses
 but gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead
 and anything which may be heated is to go through the fire and be made clean but in addition it is to be put in the water of cleaning and anything which may not go through the fire is to be put in the water
 and on the seventh day after washing your clothing you will be clean and then you may come into the tent circle
 and the lord said to moses
 get an account of everything which was taken in the war of man and of beast you and eleazar the priest and the heads of families of the people
 and let division be made of it into two parts one for the men of war who went out to the fight and one for all the people
 and from the men of war who went out let there be offered to the lord one out of every five hundred from the persons and from the oxen and asses and sheep
 take this from their part and give it to eleazar the priest as an offering to be lifted up to the lord
