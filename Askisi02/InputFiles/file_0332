 and while he was talking to them the fighter the philistine of gath goliath by name came out from the philistines lines and said the same words in davids hearing
 and all the men of israel when they saw him went in flight overcome with fear
 and the men of israel said have you seen this man clearly he has come out to put shame on israel and it is certain that if any man overcomes him the king will give that man great wealth and will give him his daughter and make his fathers family free in israel
 and david said to the men near him what will be done to the man who overcomes this philistine and takes away the shame from israel for who is this philistine a man without circumcision that he has put shame on the armies of the living god
 and the people gave him this answer so it will be done to the man who overcomes him
 and eliab his oldest brother hearing what david said to the men was moved to wrath against david and said why have you come here into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land i have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart you have come down to see the fight
 and david said what have i done now was it not only a word
 and turning away from him to one of the other men he said the same words and the people gave him the same answer
 and hearing what david said they gave saul word of it and he sent for him
 and david said to saul let no mans heart become feeble because of him i your servant will go out and have a fight with this philistine
 and saul said to david you are not able to go out against this philistine and have a fight with him for you are only a boy and he has been a man of war from his earliest days
 and david said to saul your servant has been keeper of his fathers sheep and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock
 i went out after him and overcame him and took it out of his mouth and if turning on me he came at me i took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death
 your servant has overcome lion and bear and the fate of this philistine who is without circumcision will be like theirs seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living god
 and david said the lord who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear will be my saviour from the hands of this philistine and saul said to david go  and may the lord be with you
 then saul gave david his clothing of war and put a head dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal
 and david took sauls sword and put the band round him over the metal coat and was unable to go forward for he was not used to them then david said to saul it is not possible for me to go out with these for i am not used to them so david took them off
 then he took his stick in his hand and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep keepers and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones and so he went in the direction of the philistine
 and the philistine came nearer to david and the man who had his body cover went before him
 and when the philistine taking note saw david he had a poor opinion of him for he was only a boy red haired and good looking
 and the philistine said to david am i a dog that you come out to me with sticks and the philistine put curses on david by all his gods
 and the philistine said to david come here to me and i will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field
 then david said to the philistine you come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin but i come to you in the name of the lord of armies the god of the armies of israel on which you have put shame
 this day the lord will give you up into my hands and i will overcome you and take your head off you and i will give the bodies of the philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today so that all the earth may see that israel has a god
 and all these people who are here today may see that the lord does not give salvation by sword and spear for the fight is the lords and he will give you up into our hands
 now when the philistine made a move and came near to david david quickly went at a run in the direction of the army meeting the philistine face to face
 and david put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the philistine and the stone went deep into his brow and he went down to the earth falling on his face
 so david overcame the philistine with his leather band and a stone wounding the philistine and causing his death but david had no sword in his hand
 so running up to the philistine and putting his foot on him david took his sword out of its cover and put him to death cutting off his head with it and when the philistines saw that their fighter was dead they went in flight
 and the men of israel and of judah got up and gave a cry and went after the philistines as far as gath and the town doors of ekron and the wounded of the philistines were falling down by the road from shaaraim all the way to gath and ekron
