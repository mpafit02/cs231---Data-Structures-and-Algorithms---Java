 when they see your holy behaviour in the fear of god
 do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing
 but let them be those of the unseen man of the heart the ever shining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great price in the eyes of god
 and these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past whose hope was in god being ruled by their husbands
 as sarah was ruled by abraham naming him lord whose children you are if you do well and are not put in fear by any danger
 and you husbands give thought to your way of life with your wives giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life so that you may not be kept from prayer
 last of all see that you are all in agreement feeling for one another loving one another like brothers full of pity without pride
 not giving back evil for evil or curse for curse but in place of cursing blessing because this is the purpose of god for you that you may have a heritage of blessing
 for it is said let the man who has a love of life desiring to see good days keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit
 and let him be turned from evil and do good searching for peace and going after it with all his heart
 for the eyes of the lord are on the upright and his ears are open to their prayers but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
 who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good
 but you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness have no part in their fear and do not be troubled
 but give honour to christ in your hearts as your lord and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you to give an answer in the fear of the lord and without pride
 being conscious that you have done no wrong so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as christians may be put to shame
 because if it is gods purpose for you to undergo pain it is better to do so for well doing than for evil doing
 because christ once went through pain for sins the upright one taking the place of sinners so that through him we might come back to god being put to death in the flesh but given life in the spirit
 by whom he went to the spirits in prison preaching to those
 who in the days of noah went against gods orders but god in his mercy kept back the punishment while noah got ready the ark in which a small number that is to say eight persons got salvation through water
 and baptism of which this is an image now gives you salvation not by washing clean the flesh but by making you free from the sense of sin before god through the coming again of jesus christ from the dead
 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule
 so that as jesus was put to death in the flesh do you yourselves be of the same mind for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin
 so that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh not to the desires of men but to the purpose of god
 because for long enough in times past we have been living after the way of the gentiles given up to the desires of the flesh to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images
 and they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life and are saying evil things of you
 but they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead
 for this was the reason why the good news of jesus was given even to the dead so that they might be judged as men in the flesh but might be living before god in the spirit
 but the end of all things is near so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer
 and most of all be warm in your love for one another because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number
 keep open house for all with a glad heart
