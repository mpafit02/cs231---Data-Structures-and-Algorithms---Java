 and looking round on them he was angry being sad because of their hard hearts and he said to the man put out your hand and he put it out and his hand was made well
 and the pharisees went out and straight away made designs with the herodians about how they might put him to death
 and jesus went away with his disciples to the sea and a great number from galilee came after him and from judaea
 and from jerusalem and from idumaea and the other side of jordan and the country about tyre and sidon a great number hearing what great things he did came to him
 and he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him so that he might not be crushed by the people
 for he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him
 and the unclean spirits whenever they saw him went down before him crying out and saying you are the son of god
 and he gave them special orders not to say who he was
 and he went up into the mountain and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him and they went to him
 and he took twelve to be with him so that he might send them out as preachers
 and give them the power of driving out evil spirits
 to simon he gave the second name of peter
 and to james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james he gave the second name of boanerges which is sons of thunder
 and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the zealot
 and judas iscariot who was false to him
 and he went into a house and the people came together again so that they were not even able to take bread
 and when his friends had news of it they went out to get him saying he is off his head
 and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebub and by the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
 and turning to them he said to them in the form of a story how is it possible for satan to put out satan
 if there is division in a kingdom that kingdom will come to destruction
 and if there is division in a house that house will come to destruction
 and if satan is at war with himself and there is division in him he will not keep his place but will come to an end
 but no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods without first putting cords round the strong man and then he will take his goods
 truly i say to you the sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say
 but whoever says evil things against the holy spirit will never have forgiveness but the evil he has done will be with him for ever
 because they said he has an unclean spirit
 and his mother and brothers came and were outside and sent for him requesting to see him
 and a great number were seated round him and they said to him see your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you
 and he said in answer who are my mother and my brothers
 and looking round at those who were seated about him he said see my mother and my brothers
