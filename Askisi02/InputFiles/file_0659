 and do not let hezekiah make you put your faith in the lord saying the lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 do not give ear to hezekiah for this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig tree and the water of his spring
 till i come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vine gardens
 give no attention to hezekiah when he says to you the lord will keep us safe has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of assyria
 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim where are the gods of samaria and have they kept samaria out of my hand
 who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand to give cause for the thought that the lord will keep jerusalem from falling into my hand
 but they kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was give him no answer
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came to hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the rab shakeh had said
 and on hearing it hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the lord
 and he sent eliakim who was over the house and shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 and they said to him hezekiah says this day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
 it may be that the lord your god will give ear to the words of the rab shakeh whom the king of assyria his master has sent to say evil things against the living god and will make his words come to nothing so make your prayer for the rest of the people
 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
 and isaiah said to them this is what you are to say to your master the lord says be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of assyria have said against me in your hearing
 see i will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there i will have him put to death
 so the rab shakeh went back and when he got there the king of assyria was making war against libnah for it had come to his ears that the king of assyria had gone away from lachish
 and when news came to him that tirhakah king of ethiopia had made an attack on him  and he sent representatives to hezekiah king of judah saying
 this is what you are to say to hezekiah king of judah let not your god in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 no doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe from their fate
 did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden who were in telassar
 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the town of sepharvaim of hena and ivva
 and hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it hezekiah went up to the house of the lord opening the letter there before the lord
 and he made prayer to the lord saying
 o lord of armies the god of israel seated between the winged ones you only are the god of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
 let your ear be turned to us o lord let your eyes be open o lord and see take note of all the words of sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living god
 truly o lord the kings of assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands
 and have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
 but now o lord our god give us salvation from his hand so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and you only are the lord
 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying the lord the god of israel says the prayer you have made to me against sennacherib king of assyria has come to my ears
 this is the word which the lord has said about him in the eyes of the virgin daughter of zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of jerusalem has made sport of you
