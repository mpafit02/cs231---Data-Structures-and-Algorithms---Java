 and he sent and had johns head cut off in the prison
 and his head was put on a plate and given to the girl and she took it to her mother
 and his disciples came and took up his body and put it in the earth and they went and gave jesus news of what had taken place
 now when it came to the ears of jesus he went away from there in a boat to a waste place by himself and the people hearing of it went after him on foot from the towns
 and he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them and made well those of them who were ill
 and when evening had come the disciples came to him saying this place is waste land and the time is now past send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food
 but jesus said to them there is no need for them to go away give them food yourselves
 and they say to him we have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes
 and he said give them to me
 and he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing and made division of the food and gave it to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
 and they all took of the food and had enough and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used
 and those who had food were about five thousand men in addition to women and children
 and straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side till he had sent the people away
 and after he had sent the people away he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer and when evening was come he was there by himself
 but the boat was now in the middle of the sea and was troubled by the waves for the wind was against them
 and in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
 and when they saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they gave cries of fear
 but straight away jesus said to them take heart it is i have no fear
 and peter answering said to him lord if it is you give me the order to come to you on the water
 and he said come and peter got out of the boat and walking on the water went to jesus
 but when he saw the wind he was in fear and starting to go down he gave a cry saying help lord
 and straight away jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him and said to him o man of little faith why were you in doubt
 and when they had got into the boat the wind went down
 and those who were in the boat gave him worship saying truly you are the son of god
 and when they had gone across they came to land at gennesaret
 and when the men of that place had news of him they sent into all the country round about and took to him all who were ill
 with the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
 then there came to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes saying
 why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers for they take food with unwashed hands
 and in answer he said to them why do you yourselves go against the word of god on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you
