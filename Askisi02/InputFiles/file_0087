 to whom we gave way not even for an hour so that the true words of the good news might still be with you
 but from those who seemed to be important  whatever they were has no weight with me god does not take mans person into account  those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me
 but quite the opposite when they saw that i had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision even as peter had been for those of the circumcision
  because he who was working in peter as the apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the gentiles 
 when they saw the grace which was given to me james and cephas and john who had the name of being pillars gave to me and barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the gentiles and they to the circumcision
 only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor which very thing i had much in mind to do
 but when cephas came to antioch i made a protest against him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong
 for before certain men came from james he did take food with the gentiles but when they came he went back and made himself separate fearing those who were of the circumcision
 and the rest of the jews went after him so that even barnabas was overcome by their false ways
 but when i saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news i said to cephas before them all if you being a jew are living like the gentiles and not like the jews how will you make the gentiles do the same as the jews
 we being jews by birth and not sinners of the gentiles
 being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ we had faith in christ jesus so that we might get righteousness by faith in christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness
 but if while we were desiring to get righteousness through christ we ourselves were seen to be sinners is christ a servant of sin in no way 
 for if i put up again those things which i gave to destruction i am seen to be a wrongdoer
 for i through the law have become dead to the law so that i might be living to god
 i have been put to death on the cross with christ still i am living no longer i but christ is living in me and that life which i now am living in the flesh i am living by faith the faith of the son of god who in love for me gave himself up for me
 i do not make the grace of god of no effect because if righteousness is through the law then christ was put to death for nothing
 o foolish galatians by what strange powers have you been tricked to whom it was made clear that jesus christ was put to death on the cross
 give me an answer to this one question did the spirit come to you through the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
 are you so foolish having made a start in the spirit will you now be made complete in the flesh
 did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose if it is in fact to no purpose
 he who gives you the spirit and does works of power among you is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith
 even as abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness
 be certain then that those who are of faith the same are sons of abraham
 and the holy writings seeing before the event that god would give the gentiles righteousness by faith gave the good news before to abraham saying in you will all the nations have a blessing
 so then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of abraham who was full of faith
 for all who are of the works of the law are under a curse because it is said in the writings a curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law
 now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of god is clear because the upright will be living by faith
 and the law is not of faith but he who does them will have life by them
 christ has made us free from the curse of the law having become a curse for us because it is said in the writings a curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree
