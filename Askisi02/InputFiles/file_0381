 but it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house
 and they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen for they made use of it with good faith
 the money of the offerings for error and the sin offerings was not taken into the house of the lord it was the priests
 then hazael king of aram went up against gath and took it and his purpose was to go up to jerusalem
 then jehoash king of judah took all the holy things which jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers the kings of judah had given to the lord together with the things he himself had given and all the gold in the temple store and in the kings house and sent it to hazael king of aram and he went away from jerusalem
 now the rest of the acts of joash and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and his servants made a secret design and put joash to death at the house of millo on the way down to silla
 and jozacar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants came to him and put him to death and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and amaziah his son became king in his place
 in the twenty third year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu became king over israel in samaria ruling for seventeen years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which he did and made israel do he did not keep himself from them
 so the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the power of hazael king of aram and into the power of ben hadad the son of hazael again and again
 then jehoahaz made prayer to the lord and the lord gave ear to him for he saw how cruelly israel was crushed by the king of aram
  and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they became free from the hands of the aramaeans and the children of israel were living in their tents as in the past
 but still they did not give up the sin of jeroboam which he made israel do but went on with it and there was an image of asherah in samaria 
 for out of all his army jehoahaz had only fifty horsemen and ten carriages and ten thousand footmen the king of aram had given them up to destruction crushing them like dust
 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and joash his son became king in his place
 in the thirty seventh year of the rule of joash king of judah joash the son of jehoahaz became king over israel in samaria ruling for sixteen years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning away from the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat which he did and made israel do but he went on with it
 now the rest of the acts of joash and all he did and the force with which he went to war against amaziah king of judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and joash went to rest with his fathers and jeroboam took his place as king and joash was put into the earth in samaria with the kings of israel
 now elisha became ill with the disease which was the cause of his death and joash king of israel came down to him and weeping over him said my father my father the war carriages of israel and its horsemen 
 then elisha said to him take bow and arrows and he took bow and arrows
 and he said to the king of israel put your hand on the bow and he put his hand on it and elisha put his hands on the kings hands
 then he said let the window be open to the east and he got it open then elisha said let the arrow go and he let it go and he said the lords arrow of salvation of salvation over aram for you will overcome the aramaeans in aphek and put an end to them
 and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said to the king of israel send them down into the earth and he did so three times and no more
 then the man of god was angry with him and said if you had done it five or six times then you would have overcome aram completely but now you will only overcome them three times
 and death came to elisha and they put his body into the earth now in the spring of the year armed bands of moabites frequently came overrunning the land
 and while they were putting a dead man into the earth they saw a band coming and they put the man quickly into the place where elishas body was and the dead man on touching elishas bones came to life again and got up on his feet
 and israel was crushed under the power of hazael king of aram all the days of jehoahaz
