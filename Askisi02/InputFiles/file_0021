 i give you orders before god the giver of life and christ jesus who before pontius pilate gave witness to the faith
 to keep the word untouched by evil clear from all shame till the revelation of our lord jesus christ
 which at the right time he will make clear who is the eternal and only ruler king of kings and lord of lords
 who only has life for ever living in light to which no man may come near whom no man has seen or is able to see to whom be honour and power for ever so be it
 give orders to those who have money and goods in this life not to be lifted up in their minds or to put their hope in the uncertain chances of wealth but in god who gives us in full measure all things for our use
 and to do good having wealth in good works being quick to give taking part with one another
 making ready for themselves a safe place for the time to come so that the true life may be theirs
 o timothy take good care of that which is given to you turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named
 through which some who gave their minds to it have been turned away from the faith grace be with you
 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the saints who are living in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
 who through the purpose of god have been made holy by the spirit disciples of jesus made clean by his blood may you have grace and peace in full measure
 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of jesus christ from the dead
 and a heritage fair holy and for ever new waiting in heaven for you
 who by the power of god are kept through faith for that salvation which will be seen at the last day
 you have cause for great joy in this though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time being tested in all sorts of ways
 so that the true metal of your faith being of much greater value than gold  which though it comes to an end is tested by fire  may come to light in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of jesus christ
 to whom your love is given though you have not seen him and the faith which you have in him though you do not see him now gives you joy greater than words and full of glory
 for so you have the true end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
 for the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation
 attempting to see what sort of time the spirit of christ which was in them was pointing to when it gave witness to the pains which christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them
 and it was made clear to those prophets that they were gods servants not for themselves but for you to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the holy spirit sent down from heaven things which even angels have a desire to see
 so make your minds ready and keep on the watch hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of jesus christ
 like children ruled by god do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge
 but be holy in every detail of your lives as he whose servants you are is holy
 because it has been said in the writings you are to be holy for i am holy
 and if you give the name of father to him who judging every man by his acts has no respect for a mans position then go in fear while you are on this earth
 being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction
 but through holy blood like that of a clean and unmarked lamb even the blood of christ
 who was marked out by god before the making of the world but was caused to be seen in these last times for you
 who through him have faith in god who took him up again from the dead into glory so that your faith and hope might be in god
