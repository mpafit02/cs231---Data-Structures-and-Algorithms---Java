 but his words were about that holy building which was his body
 so when he had come back again from the dead the memory of these words came back to the disciples and they had faith in the holy writings and in the word which jesus had said
 now while he was in jerusalem at the feast of the passover a great number of people came to have faith in his name after seeing the signs which he did
 but jesus did not have faith in them because he had knowledge of them all
 he had no need for any witness about man for he himself had knowledge of what was in man
 now on the first day of the week very early while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it
 then she went running to simon peter and to the other disciple who was loved by jesus and said to them they have taken away the lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him
 so peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead
 they went running together and the other disciple got in front of peter and came first to the hole in the rock
 and looking in he saw the linen bands on the earth but he did not go in
 then simon peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock and he saw the linen bands on the earth
 and the cloth which had been round his head not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself
 then the other disciple who came there first went in and he saw and belief came to him
 for at that time they had no knowledge that the writings said that he would have to come again from the dead
 so then the disciples went away again to their houses
 but mary was still there outside the hole in the rock weeping and while she was weeping and looking into the hole
 she saw two angels in white seated where the body of jesus had been one at the head and the other at the feet
 they said to her woman why are you weeping she said to them because they have taken away my lord and i have no knowledge where they have put him
 and then looking round she saw jesus there but had no idea that it was jesus
 jesus said to her woman why are you weeping who are you looking for she taking him for the gardener said to him sir if you have taken him away from here say where you have put him and i will take him away
 jesus said to her mary  turning she said to him in hebrew rabboni   which is to say master 
 jesus said to her do not put your hand on me for i have not gone up to the father but go to my brothers and say to them i go up to my father and your father to my god and your god
 mary magdalene went with the news to the disciples and said she had seen the lord and that he had said these things to her
 at evening on that day the first day of the week when for fear of the jews the doors were shut where the disciples were jesus came among them and said to them may peace be with you 
 and when he had said this he let them see his hands and his side then the disciples were glad when they saw the lord
 and jesus said to them again may peace be with you  as the father sent me even so i now send you
 and when he had said this breathing on them he said to them let the holy spirit come on you
 any to whom you give forgiveness will be made free from their sins and any from whom you keep back forgiveness will still be in their sins
 now thomas one of the twelve named didymus was not with them when jesus came
 so the other disciples said to him we have seen the lord but he said to them if i do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and if i do not put my hand into his side i will never have belief
