 put on much wood heating up the fire boiling the flesh well and making the soup thick and let the bones be burned
 and i will put her on the coals so that she may be heated and her brass burned so that what is unclean in her may become soft and her waste be completely taken away
 i have made myself tired to no purpose still all the waste which is in her has not come out it has an evil smell
 as for your unclean purpose because i have been attempting to make you clean but you have not been made clean from it you will not be made clean till i have let loose my passion on you in full measure
 i the lord have said the word and i will do it i will not go back or have mercy and my purpose will not be changed in the measure of your ways and of your evil doings you will be judged says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man see i am taking away the desire of your eyes by disease but let there be no sorrow or weeping or drops running from your eyes
 let there be no sound of sorrow make no weeping for your dead put on your head dress and your shoes on your feet let not your lips be covered and do not take the food of those in grief
 so in the morning i was teaching the people and in the evening death took my wife and in the morning i did what i had been ordered to do
 and the people said to me will you not make clear to us the sense of these things is it for us you do them
 then i said to them the word of the lord came to me saying
 say to the people of israel the lord has said see i will make my holy place unclean the pride of your strength the pleasure of your eyes and the desire of your soul and your sons and daughters who did not come with you here will be put to the sword
 and you will do as i have done not covering your lips or taking the food of those in grief
 and your head dresses will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet there will be no sorrow or weeping but you will be wasting away in the punishment of your evil doing and you will be looking at one another in wonder
 and ezekiel will be a sign to you everything he has done you will do when this takes place you will be certain that i am the lord
 and as for you son of man your mouth will be shut in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that on which their hearts are fixed and their sons and daughters
 in that day one who has got away safe will come to you to give you news of it
 in that day your mouth will be open to him who has got away safe and you will say words to him and your lips will no longer be shut so you will be a sign to them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the children of ammon and be a prophet against them
 and say to the children of ammon give ear to the word of the lord this is what the lord has said because you said aha  against my holy place when it was made unclean and against the land of israel when it was made waste and against the people of judah when they were taken away as prisoners
 for this cause i will give you up to the children of the east for their heritage and they will put their tent circles in you and make their houses in you they will take your fruit for their food and your milk for their drink
 and i will make rabbah a place for housing camels and the children of ammon a resting place for flocks and you will be certain that i am the lord
 for the lord has said because you have made sounds of joy with your hands stamping your feet and have been glad putting shame with all your soul on the land of israel
 for this cause my hand has been stretched out against you and i will give up your goods to be taken by the nations i will have you cut off from the peoples and will put an end to you among the countries i will give you up to destruction and you will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said because moab and seir are saying see the people of judah are like all the nations
 for this cause i will let the side of moab be uncovered and his towns on every side the glory of the land beth jeshimoth baal meon and as far as kiriathaim
 to the children of the east i have given her for a heritage as well as the children of ammon so that there may be no memory of her among the nations
 and i will be the judge of moab and they will see that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said because edom has taken his payment from the people of judah and has done great wrong in taking payment from them
