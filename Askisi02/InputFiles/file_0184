 and there were women watching from a distance among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome
 who went with him when he was in galilee and took care of him and a number of other women who came up with him to jerusalem
 and when it was evening because it was the time of getting ready that is the day before the sabbath
 there came joseph of arimathaea a responsible man in high honour who was himself waiting for the kingdom of god and he went in to pilate without fear and made a request for the body of jesus
 and pilate was surprised that he was dead and sending for the captain he put a question to see if he had been dead for long
 and when he had news of it from the captain he let joseph have the body
 and he got a linen cloth and taking him down put the linen cloth round him and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock and a stone was rolled against the door
 and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where he was put
 and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome got spices so that they might come and put them on him
 and very early after dawn on the first day of the week they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put
 and they were saying among themselves who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us
 and looking up they saw that the stone was rolled back and it was of great size
 and when they went in they saw a young man seated on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were full of wonder
 and he said to them do not be troubled you are looking for jesus the nazarene who has been put to death on the cross he has come back from the dead he is not here see the place where they put him 
 but go say to his disciples and to peter he goes before you into galilee there you will see him as he said to you
 and they went out quickly from the place because fear and great wonder had come on them and they said nothing to anyone because they were full of fear that 
 now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week he went first to mary magdalene from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits
 she went and gave news of it to those who had been with him while they were sorrowing and weeping
 and they when it came to their ears that he was living and had been seen by her had no belief in it
 and after these things he was seen in another form by two of them while they were walking on their way into the country
 and they went away and gave news of it to the rest and they had no belief in what was said
 and later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead
 and he said to them go into all the world and give the good news to everyone
 he who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation but he who has not faith will be judged
 and these signs will be with those who have faith in my name they will send out evil spirits and they will make use of new languages
 they will take up snakes and if there is poison in their drink it will do them no evil they will put their hands on those who are ill and they will get well
 so then the lord jesus after he had said these words to them was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of god
 and they went out preaching everywhere the lord working with them and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after so be it
 and when he came into capernaum again after some days the news went about that he was in the house
 and a great number had come together so that there was no longer room for them no not even about the door and he gave them teaching
