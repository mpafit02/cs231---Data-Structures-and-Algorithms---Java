 and of the tribe of the children of naphtali a chief pedahel the son of ammihud
 these are they to whom the lord gave orders to make the distribution of the heritage among the children of israel in the land of canaan
 and the lord said to moses in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho
 give orders to the children of israel to give to the levites from the heritage which is theirs towns for themselves with land on the outskirts of the towns
 these towns are to be their living places with land round them for their cattle and their food and all their beasts
 stretching from the wall of the towns a distance of a thousand cubits all round
 the measure of this space of land is to be two thousand cubits outside the town on the east and two thousand cubits on the south and on the west and on the north the town being in the middle this space will be the outskirts of their towns
 and the towns which you give the levites are to be the six safe places to which the taker of life may go in flight and in addition you are to give them forty two towns
 forty eight towns are to be given to the levites all with land round them
 and these towns are to be given out of the heritage of the children of israel taking the greater number from those who have much and a smaller number from those who have little everyone in the measure of his heritage is to give of his property to the levites
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you have gone over jordan into the land of canaan
 then let certain towns be marked out as safe places to which anyone who takes the life of another in error may go in flight
 in these towns you may be safe from him who has the right of punishment so that death may not overtake the taker of life till he has been judged by the meeting of the people
 six of the towns which you give will be such safe places
 three on the other side of jordan and three in the land of canaan to be safe places for flight
 for the children of israel and for the man from another country who is living among them these six towns are to be safe places where anyone causing the death of another through error may go in flight
 but if a man gives another man a blow with an iron instrument causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 or if he gives him a blow with a stone in his hand causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 or if he gave him blows with a wood instrument in his hands causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may himself put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
 if in his hate he put a sword through him or waiting secretly for him sent a spear or stone at him causing his death
 or in hate gave him blows with his hand causing death he who gave the death blow is to be put to death he is a taker of life he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
 but if a man has given a wound to another suddenly and not in hate or without design has sent something against him
 or has given him a blow with a stone without seeing him so causing his death though he had nothing against him and no desire to do him evil
 then let the meeting of the people be judge between the man responsible for the death and him who has the right of punishment for blood acting by these rules
 and let the people keep the man responsible for the death safe from the hands of him who has the right of punishment for blood and send him back to his safe town where he had gone in flight there let him be till the death of the high priest who was marked with the holy oil
 but if ever he goes outside the walls of the safe town where he had gone in flight
 and the giver of punishment meeting him outside the walls of the town puts him to death he will not be responsible for his blood
 because he had been ordered to keep inside the safe town till the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the taker of life may come back to the place of his heritage
