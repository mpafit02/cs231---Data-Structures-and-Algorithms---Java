 magdiel iram these are the edomite chiefs in their places in their heritage this is esau the father of the edomites
 now jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself in the land of canaan
 these are the generations of jacob joseph a boy seventeen years old was looking after the flock together with his brothers the sons of bilhah and zilpah his fathers wives and joseph gave their father a bad account of them
 now the love which israel had for joseph was greater than his love for all his other children because he got him when he was an old man and he had a long coat made for him
 and because his brothers saw that joseph was dearer to his father than all the others they were full of hate for him and would not say a kind word to him
 now joseph had a dream and he gave his brothers an account of it which made their hate greater than ever
 and he said to them let me give you the story of my dream
 we were in the field getting the grain stems together and my grain kept upright and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine
 and his brothers said to him are you to be our king will you have authority over us and because of his dream and his words their hate for him became greater than ever
 then he had another dream and gave his brothers an account of it saying i have had another dream the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me
 and he gave word of it to his father and his brothers but his father protesting said what sort of a dream is this am i and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you
 and his brothers were full of envy but his father kept his words in mind
 now his brothers went to keep watch over their fathers flock in shechem
 and israel said to joseph are not your brothers with the flock in shechem come i will send you to them and he said to him here am i
 and he said to him go now and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is then come back and give me word so he sent him out of the valley of hebron and he came to shechem
 and a man saw him wandering in the country and said to him what are you looking for
 and he said i am looking for my brothers please give me word of where they are keeping their flock
 and the man said they have gone away from here for they said in my hearing let us go to dothan so joseph went after them and came up with them at dothan
 but they saw him when he was a long way off and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death
 saying to one another see here comes this dreamer
 let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes and we will say an evil beast has put him to death then we will see what becomes of his dreams
 but reuben hearing these words got him out of their hands saying let us not take his life
 do not put him to a violent death but let him be placed in one of the holes this he said to keep him safe from their hands with the purpose of taking him back to his father again
 so when joseph came to his brothers they took off his long coat which he had on
 and they took him and put him in the hole now the hole had no water in it
 then seating themselves they took their meal and looking up they saw a travelling band of ishmaelites coming from gilead on their way to egypt with spices and perfumes on their camels
 and judah said to his brothers what profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood
 let us give him to these ishmaelites for a price and let us not put violent hands on him for he is our brother our flesh and his brothers gave ear to him
 and some traders from midian went by so pulling joseph up out of the hole they gave him to the ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver and they took him to egypt
