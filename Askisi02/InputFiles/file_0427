 i have sent destruction on your fields by burning and disease the increase of your gardens and your vine gardens your fig trees and your olive trees has been food for worms and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 i have sent disease among you as it was in egypt i have put your young men to the sword and have taken away your horses i have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 and i have sent destruction among you as when god sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah and you were like a burning stick pulled out of the fire and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 so this is what i will do to you o israel and because i will do this to you be ready for a meeting with your god o israel
 for see he who gave form to the mountains and made the wind giving knowledge of his purpose to man who makes the morning dark and is walking on the high places of the earth the lord the god of armies is his name
 give ear to this word my song of sorrow over you o children of israel
 the virgin of israel has been made low never again to be lifted up she is stretched out by herself on her land there is no one to put her on her feet again
 for these are the words of the lord god the town which was able to send out a thousand will have only a hundred and that which sent out a hundred will have only ten in israel
 for these are the words of the lord to the children of israel let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have life
 do not be looking for help to beth el and do not go to gilgal or make your way to beer sheba for gilgal will certainly be taken prisoner and beth el will come to nothing
 go to the lord for help so that you may have life for fear that he may come like fire bursting out in the family of joseph causing destruction and there will be no one to put it out in beth el
 you who make the work of judging a bitter thing crushing down righteousness to the earth
 go for help to him who makes orion and the pleiades by whom the deep dark is turned into morning who makes the day black with night whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea sending them out over the face of the earth the lord is his name
 who sends sudden destruction on the strong so that destruction comes on the walled town
 they have hate for him who makes protest against evil in the public place and he whose words are upright is disgusting to them
 so because the poor man is crushed under your feet and you take taxes from him of grain you have made for yourselves houses of cut stone but you will not take your rest in them the fair vine gardens planted by your hands will not give you wine
 for i have seen how your evil doing is increased and how strong are your sins you troublers of the upright who take rewards and do wrong to the cause of the poor in the public place
 so the wise will say nothing in that time for it is an evil time
 go after good and not evil so that life may be yours and so the lord the god of armies will be with you as you say
 be haters of evil and lovers of good and let right be done in the public place it may be that the lord the god of armies will have mercy on the rest of joseph
 so these are the words of the lord the god of armies the lord there will be weeping in all the open spaces and in all the streets they will say sorrow  sorrow  and they will get in the farmer to the weeping and the makers of sad songs to give cries of grief
 in all the vine gardens there will be cries of grief for i will go through among you says the lord
 sorrow to you who are looking for the day of the lord  what is the day of the lord to you it is dark and not light
 as if a man running away from a lion came face to face with a bear or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake
 will not the day of the lord be dark and not light even very dark with no light shining in it
 your feasts are disgusting to me i will have nothing to do with them i will take no delight in your holy meetings
 even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings i will not take pleasure in them i will have nothing to do with the peace offerings of your fat beasts
 take away from me the noise of your songs my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments
 but let the right go rolling on like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
 did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years o israel
