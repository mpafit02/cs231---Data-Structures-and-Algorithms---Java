 and they are to make clear to my people the division between what is holy and what is common and to give them the knowledge of what is clean and what is unclean
 in any cause they are to be in the position of judges judging in harmony with my decisions they are to keep my laws and my rules in all my fixed feasts and they are to keep my sabbaths holy
 they are not to come near any dead person so as to become unclean but for a father or mother or son or daughter or brother or for a sister who has no husband they may make themselves unclean
 and after he has been made clean seven days are to be numbered for him
 and on the day when he goes into the inner square to do the work of the holy place he is to make his sin offering says the lord
 and they are to have no heritage i am their heritage you are to give them no property in israel i am their property
 their food is to be the meal offering and the sin offering and the offering for error and everything given specially to the lord in israel will be theirs
 and the best of all the first fruits of everything and every offering which is lifted up of all your offerings will be for the priests and you are to give the priest the first of your bread making so causing a blessing to come on your house
 the priests may not take for food any bird or beast which has come to a natural death or whose death has been caused by another animal
 and when you are making a distribution of the land by the decision of the lord for your heritage you are to make an offering to the lord of a part of the land as holy it is to be twenty five thousand long and twenty thousand wide all the land inside these limits is to be holy
 of this a square five hundred long and five hundred wide is to be for the holy place with a space of fifty cubits all round it
 and of this measure let a space be measured twenty five thousand long and ten thousand wide in it there will be the holy place even the most holy
 this holy part of the land is to be for the priests the servants of the holy place who come near to the lord to do his work it is to be a place for their houses and for grass land and for cattle
 a space of land twenty five thousand long and ten thousand wide is to be for the levites the servants of the house a property for themselves for towns for their living places
 and as the property for the town you are to have a part five thousand wide and twenty five thousand long by the side of the offering of the holy part of the land this is to be for all the children of israel
 and for the ruler there is to be a part on one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the property of the town in front of the holy offering and in front of the property of the town on the west of it and on the east measured in the same line as one of the parts of the land from its limit on the west to its limit on the east of the land
 and this will be his heritage in israel and my rulers will no longer be cruel masters to my people but they will give the land as a heritage to the children of israel by their tribes
 this is what the lord has said let this be enough for you o rulers of israel let there be an end of violent behaviour and wasting do what is right judging uprightly let there be no more driving out of my people says the lord
 have true scales and a true ephah and a true bath
 the ephah and the bath are to be of the same measure so that the bath is equal to a tenth of a homer and the ephah to a tenth of a homer the unit of measure is to be a homer
 and the shekel is to be twenty gerahs five shekels are five and ten shekels are ten and your maneh is to be fifty shekels
 this is the offering you are to give a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley
 and the fixed measure of oil is to be a tenth of a bath from the cor for ten baths make up the cor
 and one lamb from the flock out of every two hundred from all the families of israel for a meal offering and for a burned offering and for peace offerings to take away their sin says the lord
 all the people are to give this offering to the ruler
 and the ruler will be responsible for the burned offering and the meal offering and the drink offering at the feasts and the new moons and the sabbaths at all the fixed feasts of the children of israel he will give the sin offering and meal offering and burned offering and the peace offerings to take away the sin of the children of israel
 this is what the lord has said in the first month on the first day of the month you are to take a young ox without any mark on him and you are to make the holy place clean
 and the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the uprights at the sides of the doors of the house and on the four angles of the shelf of the altar and on the sides of the doorway of the inner square
 and this you are to do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who is in error and for the feeble minded you are to make the house free from sin
 in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month you are to have the passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread is to be your food
