 of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi
 of the tribe of gad gevel the son of machi
 these are the names of the men whom moses sent to get knowledge about the land and moses gave to hoshea the son of nun the name of joshua
 so moses sent them to have a look at the land of canaan and said to them go up into the south and into the hill country
 and see what the land is like and if the people living in it are strong or feeble small or great in number
 and what sort of land they are living in if it is good or bad and what their living places are tent circles or walled towns
 and if the land is fertile or poor and if there is wood in it or not and be of good heart and come back with some of the produce of the land now it was the time when the first grapes were ready
 so they went up and got a view of the land from the waste land of zin to rehob on the way to hamath
 they went up into the south and came to hebron and ahiman and sheshai and talmai the children of anak were living there  now the building of hebron took place seven years before that of zoan in egypt 
 and they came to the valley of eshcol and cutting down a vine branch with its grapes two of them took it on a rod between them and they took some pomegranates and figs
 that place was named the valley of eshcol because of the grapes which the children of israel took from there
 at the end of forty days they came back from viewing the land
 and they came back to moses and aaron and all the children of israel to kadesh in the waste land of paran and gave an account to them and to all the people and let them see the produce of the land
 and they said we came to the land where you sent us and truly it is flowing with milk and honey and here is some of the produce of it
 but the people living in the land are strong and the towns are walled and very great further we saw the children of anak there
 and the amalekites are in the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites are living in the hill country and the canaanites by the sea and by the side of jordan
 then caleb made signs to the people to keep quiet and said to moses let us go up straight away and take this land for we are well able to overcome it
 but the men who had gone up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we
 and they gave the children of israel a bad account of the land they had been to see saying this land through which we went is a land causing destruction to those living in it and all the people we saw there are men of more than common size
 there we saw those great men the sons of anak offspring of the nephilim and we seemed to ourselves no more than insects and so we seemed to them
 then all the people gave load cries of grief and all that night they gave themselves up to weeping
 and all the children of israel crying out against moses and aaron said if only we had come to our death in the land of egypt or even in this waste land 
 why is the lord taking us into this land to come to our death by the sword our wives and our little ones will get into strange hands would it not be better for us to go back to egypt
 and they said to one another let us make a captain over us and go back to egypt
 then moses and aaron went down on their faces before the meeting of the people
 and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh two of those who had been to see the land giving signs of grief
 said to all the children of israel this land which we went through to see is a very good land
 and if the lord has delight in us he will take us into this land and give it to us a land flowing with milk and honey
 only do not go against the lord or go in fear of the people of the land for they will be our food their strength has been taken from them and the lord is with us have no fear of them
 but all the people said they were to be stoned then the glory of the lord was seen in the tent of meeting before the eyes of all the children of israel
