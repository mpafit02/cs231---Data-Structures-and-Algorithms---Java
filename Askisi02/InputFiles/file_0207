 but so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them go to the sea and let down a hook and take the first fish which comes up and in his mouth you will see a bit of money take that and give it to them for me and you
 in that hour the disciples came to jesus saying who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
 and he took a little child and put him in the middle of them
 and said truly i say to you if you do not have a change of heart and become like little children you will not go into the kingdom of heaven
 whoever then will make himself as low as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
 and whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me
 but whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck and to come to his end in the deep sea
 a curse is on the earth because of trouble  for it is necessary for trouble to come but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes
 and if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble let it be cut off and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than having two hands or two feet to go into the eternal fire
 and if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with one eye than having two eyes to go into the hell of fire
 let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value for i say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my father in heaven
   
 what would you say now if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone wandering away will he not let the ninety nine be and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one
 and if he comes across it truly i say to you he has more joy over it than over the ninety nine which have not gone out of the way
 even so it is not the pleasure of your father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction
 and if your brother does wrong to you go make clear to him his error between you and him in private if he gives ear to you you have got your brother back again
 but if he will not give ear to you take with you one or two more that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain
 and if he will not give ear to them let it come to the hearing of the church and if he will not give ear to the church let him be to you as a gentile and a tax farmer
 truly i say to you whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
 again i say to you that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request it will be done for them by my father in heaven
 for where two or three are come together in my name there am i among them
 then peter came and said to him lord what number of times may my brother do wrong against me and i give him forgiveness till seven times
 jesus says to him i say not to you till seven times but till seventy times seven
 for this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants
 and at the start one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents
 and because he was not able to make payment his lord gave orders for him and his wife and his sons and daughters and all he had to be given for money and payment to be made
 so the servant went down on his face and gave him worship saying lord give me time to make payment and i will give you all
 and the lord of that servant being moved with pity let him go and made him free of the debt
 but that servant went out and meeting one of the other servants who was in debt to him for one hundred pence he took him by the throat saying make payment of your debt
 so that servant went down on his face requesting him and saying give me time and i will make payment to you
