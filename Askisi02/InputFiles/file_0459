 a blessing will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the fruit of your cattle the increase of your herd and the young of your flock
 a blessing will be on your basket and on your bread basin
 a blessing will be on your coming in and on your going out
 by the power of the lord those who take arms against you will be overcome before you they will come out against you one way and will go in flight from you seven ways
 the lord will send his blessing on your store houses and on everything to which you put your hand his blessing will be on you in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 the lord will keep you as a people holy to himself as he has said to you in his oath if you keep the orders of the lord your god and go on walking in his ways
 and all the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the lord is on you and they will go in fear of you
 and the lord will make you fertile in every good thing in the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your fields in the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give you
 opening his store house in heaven the lord will send rain on your land at the right time blessing all the work of your hands other nations will make use of your wealth and you will have no need of theirs
 the lord will make you the head and not the tail and you will ever have the highest place if you give ear to the orders of the lord your god which i give you today to keep and to do them
 not turning away from any of the orders which i give you today to the right hand or to the left or going after any other gods to give them worship
 but if you do not give ear to the voice of the lord your god and take care to do all his orders and his laws which i give you today then all these curses will come on you and overtake you
 you will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field
 a curse will be on your basket and on your bread basin
 a curse will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock
 you will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out
 the lord will send on you cursing and trouble and punishment in everything to which you put your hand till sudden destruction overtakes you because of your evil ways in which you have been false to me
 the lord will send disease after disease on you till you have been cut off by death from the land to which you are going
 the lord will send wasting disease and burning pain and flaming heat against you keeping back the rain till your land is waste and dead so will it be till your destruction is complete
 and the heaven over your heads will be brass and the earth under you hard as iron

 the lord will let you be overcome by your haters you will go out against them one way and you will go in flight before them seven ways you will be the cause of fear among all the kingdoms of the earth
 your bodies will be meat for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth there will be no one to send them away
 the lord will send on you the disease of egypt and other sorts of skin diseases which nothing will make well
 he will make your minds diseased and your eyes blind and your hearts wasted with fear
 you will go feeling your way when the sun is high like a blind man for whom all is dark and nothing will go well for you you will be crushed and made poor for ever and you will have no saviour
 you will take a wife but another man will have the use of her the house which your hands have made will never be your resting place you will make a vine garden and never take the fruit of it
 your ox will be put to death before your eyes but its flesh will not be your food your ass will be violently taken away before your face and will not be given back to you your sheep will be given to your haters and there will be no saviour for you
 your sons and your daughters will be given to another people and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day and you will have no power to do anything
 the fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever
