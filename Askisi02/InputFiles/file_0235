 and he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes and he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast whose death wound was made well
 and he does great signs even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men
 and those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and came to life
 and he had power to give breath to the image of the beast so that words might come from the image of the beast and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death
 and he gives to all small and great the poor and those who have wealth the free and those who are not free a mark on their right hand or on their brows
 so that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark even the name of the beast or the number of his name
 here is wisdom he who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast because it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred and sixty six
 and i saw the lamb on the mountain of zion and with him a hundred and forty four thousand marked on their brows with his name and the name of his father
 and a voice from heaven came to my ears like the sound of great waters and the sound of loud thunder and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players playing on instruments of music
 and they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat and before the four beasts and the rulers and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and forty four thousand even those from the earth whom god has made his for a price
 these are they who have not made themselves unclean with women for they are virgins these are they who go after the lamb wherever he goes these were taken from among men to be the first fruits to god and to the lamb
 and in their mouth there was no false word for they are untouched by evil
 and i saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth and to every nation and tribe and language and people
 saying with a loud voice have fear of god and give him glory because the hour of his judging is come and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water
 and a second angel came after saying destruction has come to babylon the great which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways
 and a third angel came after them saying with a loud voice if any man gives worship to the beast and his image and has his mark on his brow or on his hand
 to him will be given of the wine of gods wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain burning with fire before the holy angels and before the lamb
 and the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever and they have no rest day and night who give worship to the beast and his image and have on them the mark of his name
 here is the quiet strength of the saints who keep the orders of god and the faith of jesus
 and a voice from heaven came to my ears saying put in writing there is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the lord yes says the spirit that they may have rest from their troubles for their works go with them
 and i saw a white cloud and on the cloud i saw one seated like a son of man having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp curved blade
 and another angel came out from the house of god crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud put in your blade and let the grain be cut because the hour for cutting it is come for the grain of the earth is over ready
 and he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth and the grain of the earth was cut
 and another angel came out from the house of god which is in heaven having a sharp curved blade
 and another angel came out from the altar who has power over fire and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade saying put in your sharp blade and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut for her grapes are fully ready
 and the angel sent his blade into the earth and the vine of the earth was cut and he put it into the great wine crusher of the wrath of god
 and the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town and blood came out from them even to the head bands of the horses two hundred miles
 and i saw another sign in heaven great and strange seven angels having the seven last punishments for in them the wrath of god is complete
 and i saw a sea which seemed like glass mixed with fire and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name were in their places by the sea of glass with gods instruments of music in their hands
 and they give the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and full of wonder are your works o lord god ruler of all true and full of righteousness are your ways eternal king
