 and when jesus saw that the people came running together he gave orders to the unclean spirit saying to him you spirit who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing i say to you come out of him and never again go into him
 and after crying out and shaking him violently it came out and the child became like one dead so that most of them said he is dead
 but jesus took him by the hand lifting him up and he got up
 and when he had gone into the house his disciples said to him privately why were we unable to send it out
 and he said to them nothing will make this sort come out but prayer
 and they went out from there through galilee and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it
 for he was giving his disciples teaching and saying to them the son of man is given up into the hands of men and they will put him to death and when he is dead after three days he will come back from the dead
 but the saying was not clear to them and they were in fear of questioning him about it
 and they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he put the question to them what were you talking about on the way
 but they said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves on the way about who was the greatest
 and seating himself he made the twelve come to him and he said to them if any man has the desire to be first he will be last of all and servant of all
 and he took a little child and put him in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them
 whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour not to me but to him who sent me
 john said to him master we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name and we said that he might not because he is not one of us
 but jesus said say not so for there is no man who will do a great work in my name and be able at the same time to say evil of me
 he who is not against us is for us
 whoever gives you a cup of water because you are christs truly i say to you he will in no way be without his reward
 and whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea
 and if your hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell into the eternal fire
   
 and if your foot is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell
   
 and if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out it is better for you to go into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to go into hell
 where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out
 everyone will be salted with fire
 salt is good but if the taste goes from it how will you make it salt again have salt in yourselves and be at peace one with another
