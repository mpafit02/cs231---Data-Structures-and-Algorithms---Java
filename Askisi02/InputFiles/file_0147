 and he said father it is my request that you will send him to my fathers house
 for i have five brothers and let him give them an account of these things so that they may not come to this place of pain
 but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them give ear to what they say
 and he said no father abraham but if someone went to them from the dead their hearts would be changed
 and he said to him if they will not give attention to moses and the prophets they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead
 and he said to his disciples it is necessary for causes of trouble to come about but unhappy is he by whom they come
 it would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea before he made trouble for any of these little ones
 give attention to yourselves if your brother does wrong say a sharp word to him and if he has sorrow for his sin let him have forgiveness
 and if he does you wrong seven times in a day and seven times comes to you and says i have regret for what i have done let him have forgiveness
 and the twelve said to the lord make our faith greater
 and the lord said if your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this tree be rooted up and planted in the sea and it would be done
 but which of you having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep will say to him when he comes in from the field come now and be seated and have a meal
 will he not say get a meal for me and make yourself ready and see to my needs till i have had my food and drink and after that you may have yours
 does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered
 in the same way when you have done all the things which are given you to do say there is no profit in us for we have only done what we were ordered to do
 and it came about that when they were on the way to jerusalem he went through samaria and galilee
 and when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers and they keeping themselves at a distance
 said in loud voices jesus master have mercy on us
 and when he saw them he said go and let the priests see you and while they were going they were made clean
 and one of them when he saw that he was clean turning back gave praise to god in a loud voice
 and falling down on his face at the feet of jesus he gave the credit to him and he was a man of samaria
 and jesus said were there not ten men who were made clean where are the nine
 have not any of them come back to give glory to god but only this one from a strange land
 and he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well
 and when the pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of god would come he gave them an answer and said the kingdom of god will not come through observation
 and men will not say see it is here  or there  for the kingdom of god is among you
 and he said to his disciples the time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it
 and if they say to you see it is there  or it is here  do not go away or go after them
 for as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other so will the son of man be when his time comes
 but first he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation
