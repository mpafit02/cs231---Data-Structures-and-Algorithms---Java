 even as the father has given me his love so i have given my love to you be ever in my love
 if you keep my laws you will be ever in my love even as i have kept my fathers laws and am ever in his love
 i have said these things to you so that i may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete
 this is the law i give you have love one for another even as i have love for you
 greater love has no man than this that a man gives up his life for his friends
 you are my friends if you do what i give you orders to do
 no longer do i give you the name of servants because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing i give you the name of friends because i have given you knowledge of all the things which my father has said to me
 you did not take me for yourselves but i took you for myself and i gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever so that whatever request you make to the father in my name he may give it to you
 so this is my law for you have love one for another
 if you are hated by the world keep in mind that i was hated by the world before you
 if you were of the world you would be loved by the world but because you are not of the world but i have taken you out of the world you are hated by the world
 keep in mind the words i said to you a servant is not greater than his lord if they were cruel to me they will be cruel to you if they kept my words they will keep yours
 they will do all this to you because of my name  because they have no knowledge of him who sent me
 if i had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin but now they have no reason to give for their sin
 he who has hate for me has hate for my father
 if i had not done among them the works which no other man ever did they would have had no sin but now they have seen and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my father
 this comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true their hate for me was without cause
 when the helper comes whom i will send to you from the father even the spirit of true knowledge who comes from the father  he will give witness about me
 and you in addition will give witness because you have been with me from the first
 i have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt
 they will put you out of the synagogues yes the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing gods pleasure
 they will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the father or of me
 i have said these things to you so that when the time comes what i have said may come to your mind i did not say them to you at the first because then i was still with you
 but now i am going to him who sent me and not one of you says to me where are you going
 but your hearts are full of sorrow because i have said these things
 but what i am saying is true my going is for your good for if i do not go away the helper will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you
 and he when he comes will make the world conscious of sin and of righteousness and of being judged
 of sin because they have not faith in me
 of righteousness because i go to the father and you will see me no more
 of being judged because the ruler of this world has been judged
