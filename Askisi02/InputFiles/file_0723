 and the heaven and the earth and everything in them will make a song of joy over babylon for those who make her waste will come from the north says the lord
 as babylon had the dead of israel put to the sword so in babylon the dead of all the land will be stretched out
 you who have got away safe from the sword go waiting for nothing have the lord in memory when you are far away and keep jerusalem in mind
 we are shamed because bitter words have come to our ears our faces are covered with shame for men from strange lands have come into the holy places of the lords house
 for this reason see the days are coming says the lord when i will send punishment on her images and through all her land the wounded will be crying out in pain
 even if babylon was lifted up to heaven even if she had the high places of her strength shut in with walls still i would send against her those who will make her waste says the lord
 there is the sound of a cry from babylon and of a great destruction from the land of the chaldaeans
 for the lord is making babylon waste and putting an end to the great voice coming out of her and her waves are thundering like great waters their voice is sounding loud
 for the waster has come on her even on babylon and her men of war are taken their bows are broken for the lord is a rewarding god and he will certainly give payment
 and i will make her chiefs and her wise men her rulers and her captains and her men of war overcome with wine their sleep will be an eternal sleep without awaking says the king the lord of armies is his name
 the lord of armies has said the wide walls of babylon will be completely uncovered and her high doorways will be burned with fire so peoples keep on working for nothing and the weariness of nations comes to an end in the smoke
 the order which jeremiah the prophet gave to seraiah the son of neriah the son of mahseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his rule now seraiah was the chief controller of the house
 and jeremiah put in a book all the evil which was to come on babylon
 and jeremiah said to seraiah when you come to babylon see that you give them all these words
 and after reading them say o lord you have said about this place that it is to be cut off so that no one will be living in it not a man or a beast but it will be unpeopled for ever
 and it will be that when you have come to an end of reading this book you are to have a stone fixed to it and have it dropped into the euphrates
 and you are to say so babylon will go down never to be lifted up again because of the evil which i will send on her and weariness will overcome them so far these are the words of jeremiah
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king he was king for eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
 and he did evil in the eyes of the lord as jehoiakim had done
 and because of the wrath of the lord this came about in jerusalem and judah till he had sent them away from before him and zedekiah took up arms against the king of babylon
 and in the ninth year of his rule on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came against jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it building earthworks all round it
 so the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of king zedekiah
 in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the store of food in the town was almost gone so that there was no food for the people of the land
 then an opening was made in the wall of the town and all the men of war went in flight out of the town by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the kings garden  now the chaldaeans were stationed round the town  and they went by the way of the arabah
 and the chaldaean army went after king zedekiah and overtook him on the other side of jericho and all his army went in flight from him in every direction
 then they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath to be judged
 and the king of babylon put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes and he put to death all the rulers of judah in riblah
 and he put out zedekiahs eyes and the king of babylon chaining him in iron bands took him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death
 now in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month in the nineteenth year of king nebuchadrezzar king of babylon nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men a servant of the king of babylon came into jerusalem
 and he had the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burned with fire
