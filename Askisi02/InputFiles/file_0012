 the wife has not power over her body but the husband and in the same way the husband has not power over his body but the wife
 do not keep back from one another what is right but only for a short time and by agreement so that you may give yourselves to prayer and come together again so that satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self control
 but this i say as my opinion and not as an order of the lord
 it is my desire that all men might be even as i am but every man has the power of his special way of life given him by god one in this way and one in that
 but i say to the unmarried and to the widows it is good for them to be even as i am
 but if they have not self control let them get married for married life is better than the burning of desire
 but to the married i give orders though not i but the lord that the wife may not go away from her husband
  or if she goes away from him let her keep unmarried or be united to her husband again  and that the husband may not go away from his wife
 but to the rest i say and not the lord if a brother has a wife who is not a christian and it is her desire to go on living with him let him not go away from her
 and if a woman has a husband who is not a christian and it is his desire to go on living with her let her not go away from her husband
 for the husband who has not faith is made holy through his christian wife and the wife who is not a christian is made holy through the brother if not your children would be unholy but now are they holy
 but if the one who is not a christian has a desire to go away let it be so the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other but it is gods pleasure that we may be at peace with one another
 for how may you be certain o wife that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband or you o husband that you may not do the same for your wife
 only as the lord has given to a man and as is the purpose of god for him so let him go on living and these are my orders for all the churches
 if any man who is a christian has had circumcision let him keep so and if any man who is a christian has not had circumcision let him make no change
 circumcision is nothing and its opposite is nothing but only doing the orders of god is of value
 let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by god
 if you were a servant when you became a christian let it not be a grief to you but if you have a chance to become free make use of it
 for he who was a servant when he became a christian is the lords free man and he who was free when he became a christian is the lords servant
 it is the lord who has made payment for you be not servants of men
 my brothers let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of god for him
 now about virgins i have no orders from the lord but i give my opinion as one to whom the lord has given mercy to be true to him
 in my opinion then because of the present trouble it is good for a man to keep as he is
 if you are married to a wife make no attempt to get free from her if you are free from a wife do not take a wife
 if you get married it is not a sin and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin but those who do so will have trouble in the flesh but i will not be hard on you
 but i say this my brothers the time is short and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not
 and for those who are in sorrow to give no signs of it and for those who are glad to give no signs of joy and for those who are getting property to be as if they had nothing
 and for those who make use of the world not to be using it fully for this worlds way of life will quickly come to an end
 but it is my desire for you to be free from cares the unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the lord how he may give pleasure to the lord
 but the married man gives his attention to the things of this world how he may give pleasure to his wife
