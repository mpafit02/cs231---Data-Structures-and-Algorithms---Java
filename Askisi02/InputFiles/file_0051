 and after preaching the word in perga they went down to attalia
 and from there they went by ship to antioch where they had been handed over to the grace of god for the work which they had not done
 and when they came there and had got the church together they gave them an account of all the things which god had done through them and how he had made open a door of faith to the gentiles
 and they were with the disciples there for a long time
 now certain men came down from judaea teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision after the rule of moses there is no salvation
 and after paul and barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them the brothers made a decision to send paul and barnabas and certain others of them to the apostles and the rulers of the church at jerusalem about this question
 so they being sent on their way by the church went through phoenicia and samaria giving news of the salvation of the gentiles to the great joy of all the brothers
 and when they came to jerusalem they had a meeting with the church and the apostles and the rulers and they gave an account of all the things which god had done through them
 but some of the pharisees who were of the faith got up and said it is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of moses
 and the apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question
 and when there had been much discussion peter got up and said to them my brothers you have knowledge that some time back it was gods pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the gentiles so that they might have faith
 and god the searcher of hearts was a witness to them giving them the holy spirit even as he did to us
 making no division between them and us but making clean their hearts by faith
 why then are you testing god by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it
 but we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the lord jesus in the same way as they
 and all the people were quiet while barnabas and paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which god had done among the gentiles by them
 and when they had come to an end james answering said my brothers give ear to me
 symeon has given an account of how god was first pleased to take from among the gentiles a people for himself
 and this is in agreement with the words of the prophets as it is said
 after these things i will come back and will put up the tent of david which has been broken down building up again its broken parts and making it complete
 so that the rest of men may make search for the lord and all the gentiles on whom my name is named
 says the lord who has made these things clear from the earliest times
 for this reason my decision is that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the gentiles are turned to god
 but that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods and from the evil desires of the body and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from blood
 for moses from times long past has his preachers in every town reading his law in the synagogues every sabbath
 then it seemed good to the apostles and the rulers and all the church to send men from among them to antioch with paul and barnabas judas named barsabbas and silas chief men among the brothers
 and they sent a letter by them saying the apostles and the older brothers to the brothers who are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia may joy be with you
 because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words putting your souls in doubt to whom we gave no such order
 it seemed good to us having come to an agreement together to send these men to you with our well loved barnabas and paul
 men who have given up their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
