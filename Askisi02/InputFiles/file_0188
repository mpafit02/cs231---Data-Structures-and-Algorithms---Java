 and he said what picture may we give of the kingdom of god or with what story may we make it clear
 it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is put in the earth is smaller than all the seeds on the earth
 but when it is planted it comes up and becomes taller than all the plants and puts out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade
 and with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching as they were able to take it
 and without a story he said nothing to them but privately to his disciples he made all things clear
 and on that day when the evening had come he said to them let us go over to the other side
 and going away from the people they took him with them as he was in the boat and other boats were with him
 and a great storm of wind came up and the waves came into the boat so that the boat was now becoming full
 and he himself was in the back of the boat sleeping on the cushion and they awaking him said master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction
 and he came out of his sleep and gave strong orders to the wind and said to the sea peace be at rest and the wind went down and there was a great calm
 and he said to them why are you full of fear have you still no faith
 and their fear was great and they said one to another who then is this that even the wind and the sea do his orders
 and they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the gerasenes
 and when he had got out of the boat straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit
 he was living in the place of the dead and no man was able to keep him down no not with a chain
 because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him and no man was strong enough to make him quiet
 and all the time by day and by night in the place of the dead and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones
 and when he saw jesus from far off he went quickly to him and gave him worship
 and crying out with a loud voice he said what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god in gods name do not be cruel to me
 for jesus had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit
 and jesus said what is your name and he made answer my name is legion because there are a great number of us
 and he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country
 now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food
 and they said to him send us into the pigs so that we may go into them
 and he let them do it and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea about two thousand of them and they came to their death in the sea
 and their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country and people came to see what had taken place
 and they came to jesus and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated clothed and with full use of his senses and they were full of fear
 and those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits and of the fate of the pigs
 and they made a request to him to go out of their country
 and when he was getting into the boat the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him
