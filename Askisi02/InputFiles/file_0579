 and after everything which has come on us because of our evil doing and our great sin and seeing that the punishment which you o god have given us is less than the measure of our sins and that you have kept from death those of us who are here
 are we again to go against your orders taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things would you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete till there was not one who got away safe
 o lord god of israel righteousness is yours we are only a small band which has been kept from death as at this day see we are before you in our sin for no one may keep his place before you because of this
 at the first god made the heaven and the earth
 and the earth was waste and without form and it was dark on the face of the deep and the spirit of god was moving on the face of the waters
 and god said let there be light and there was light
 and god looking on the light saw that it was good and god made a division between the light and the dark
 naming the light day and the dark night and there was evening and there was morning the first day
 and god said let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters parting the waters from the waters
 and god made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it and it was so
 and god gave the arch the name of heaven and there was evening and there was morning the second day
 and god said let the waters under the heaven come together in one place and let the dry land be seen and it was so
 and god gave the dry land the name of earth and the waters together in their place were named seas and god saw that it was good
 and god said let grass come up on the earth and plants producing seed and fruit trees giving fruit in which is their seed after their sort and it was so
 and grass came up on the earth and every plant producing seed of its sort and every tree producing fruit in which is its seed of its sort and god saw that it was good
 and there was evening and there was morning the third day
 and god said let there be lights in the arch of heaven for a division between the day and the night and let them be for signs and for marking the changes of the year and for days and for years
 and let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth and it was so
 and god made the two great lights the greater light to be the ruler of the day and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night and he made the stars
 and god put them in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth
 to have rule over the day and the night and for a division between the light and the dark and god saw that it was good
 and there was evening and there was morning the fourth day
 and god said let the waters be full of living things and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven
 and god made great sea beasts and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full and every sort of winged bird and god saw that it was good
 and god gave them his blessing saying be fertile and have increase making all the waters of the seas full and let the birds be increased in the earth
 and there was evening and there was morning the fifth day
 and god said let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things cattle and all things moving on the earth and beasts of the earth after their sort and it was so
 and god made the beast of the earth after its sort and the cattle after their sort and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort and god saw that it was good
 and god said let us make man in our image like us and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth
 and god made man in his image in the image of god he made him male and female he made them
