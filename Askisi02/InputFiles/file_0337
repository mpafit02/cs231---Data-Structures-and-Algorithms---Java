 and the king took his seat as at other times by the wall and jonathan was in front and abner was seated by sauls side but there was no one in davids seat
 but saul said nothing that day for his thought was something has taken place making him unclean it is clear that he is not clean
 and on the day after the new moon that is the second day there was still no one in davids seat and saul said to his son jonathan why has the son of jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today
 and answering saul jonathan said he made a request to me that he might go to beth lehem
 saying our family is making an offering in the town and my brothers have given me orders to be there so now if i have grace in your eyes let me go away and see my brothers this is why he has not come to the kings table
 then saul was moved to wrath against jonathan and he said to him you son of an evil and uncontrolled woman have i not seen how you have given your love to the son of jesse to your shame and the shame of your mother
 for while the son of jesse is living on the earth your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger so make him come here to me for it is certainly right for him to be put to death
 and jonathan answering his father saul said to him why is he to be put to death what has he done
 and saul pointing his spear at him made an attempt to give him a wound from which it was clear to jonathan that his fathers purpose was to put david to death
 so jonathan got up from the table burning with wrath and took no part in the feast the second day of the month being full of grief for david because his father had put shame on him
 now in the morning jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to david and he had a little boy with him
 and he said to the boy go and get the arrow i let loose from my bow and while the boy was running he sent an arrow past him
 and when the boy came to the place where the arrow was jonathan crying out after the boy said has it not gone past you
 and jonathan went on crying out after the boy be quick do not keep waiting about go quickly and jonathans boy got the arrow and came back to his master
 but the boy had no idea what was going on only jonathan and david had knowledge of it
 and jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and said to him take these and go back to the town
 and when the boy had gone david came from his secret place by the hill and falling to the earth went down on his face three times and they gave one another a kiss weeping together till davids grief was the greater
 and jonathan said to david go in peace for we two have taken an oath in the name of the lord saying the lord will be between me and you and between my seed and your seed for ever then david went away and jonathan went into the town
 then david came to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was full of fear at meeting david and said to him why are you by yourself having no man with you
 and david said to ahimelech the priest the king has given me orders and has said to me say nothing to anyone about the business on which i am sending you and the orders i have given you and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to go
 so now if you have here five cakes of bread give them into my hand or whatever you have
 and the priest answering david said i have no common bread here but there is holy bread if only the young men have kept themselves from women
 and david in answer said to the priest certainly women have been kept from us and as has been done before when i have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy even though it was a common journey how much more today will their arms be made holy
 so the priest gave him the holy bread there was no other only the holy bread which had been taken from before the lord so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away
 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day kept back before the lord his name was doeg an edomite the strongest of sauls runners
 and david said to ahimelech have you no sword or spear with you here for i have come without my sword and other arms because the kings business had to be done quickly
 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom you put to death in the valley of elah is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod take that if you will for there is no other sword here and david said there is no other sword like that give it to me
 then david got up and went in flight that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath
 and the servants of achish said to him is not this david the king of the land did they not make songs about him in their dances saying saul has put to death thousands and david tens of thousands
 and david took these words to heart fearing achish the king of gath
