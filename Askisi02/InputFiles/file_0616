 and pharaoh said to joseph see i have put you over all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on josephs hand and he had him clothed with the best linen and put a chain of gold round his neck
 and he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages and they went before him crying make way  so he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of egypt
 and pharaoh gave joseph the name of zaphnath paaneah and he gave him asenath the daughter of poti phera the priest of on to be his wife so joseph went through all the land of egypt
 now joseph was thirty years old when he came before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from before the face of pharaoh and went through all the land of egypt
 now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses
 and joseph got together all the food of those seven years and made a store of food in the towns the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town
 so he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it for it might not be measured
 and before the time of need joseph had two sons to whom asenath the daughter of poti phera priest of on gave birth
 and to the first he gave the name manasseh for he said god has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my fathers house
 and to the second he gave the name ephraim for he said god has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow
 and so the seven good years in egypt came to an end
 then came the first of the seven years of need as joseph had said and in every other land they were short of food but in the land of egypt there was bread
 and when all the land of egypt was in need of food the people came crying to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said to the people go to joseph and whatever he says to you do it
 and everywhere on the earth they were short of food then joseph opening all his store houses gave the people of egypt grain for money so great was the need of food in the land of egypt
 and all lands sent to egypt to joseph to get grain for the need was great over all the earth
 now jacob hearing that there was grain in egypt said to his sons why are you looking at one another
 and he said i have had news that there is grain in egypt go down there and get grain for us so that life and not death may be ours
 so josephs ten brothers went down to get grain from egypt
 but jacob did not send benjamin josephs brother with them for fear as he said that some evil might come to him
 and the sons of israel came with all the others to get grain for they were very short of food in the land of canaan
 now joseph was ruler over all the land and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land and josephs brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth
 and when joseph saw his brothers it was clear to him who they were but he made himself strange to them and talking roughly to them said where do you come from and they said from the land of canaan to get food
 now though joseph saw that these were his brothers they had no idea who he was
 then the memory of his dreams about them came back to joseph and he said to them you have come secretly to see how poor the land is
 and they said to him not so my lord your servants have come with money to get food
 we are all one mans sons we are true men we have not come with any secret purpose
 and he said to them no but you have come to see how poor the land is
 then they said we your servants are twelve brothers sons of one man in the land of canaan the youngest of us is now with our father and one is dead
