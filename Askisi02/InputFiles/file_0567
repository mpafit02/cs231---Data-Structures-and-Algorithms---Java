 this is what the lord has said this is jerusalem i have put her among the nations and countries are round her on every side
 and she has gone against my orders by doing evil more than the nations and against my rules more than the countries round her for they have given up my orders and as for my rules they have not gone in the way of them
 for this cause the lord has said because you have been more uncontrolled than the nations round about you and have not been guided by my rules or kept my orders but have kept the orders of the nations round about you
 for this cause the lord has said see i even i am against you and i will be judging among you before the eyes of the nations
 and i will do in you what i have not done and will not do again because of all your disgusting ways
 for this cause fathers will take their sons for food among you and sons will make a meal of their fathers and i will be judge among you and all the rest of you i will send away to every wind
 for this cause by my life says the lord because you have made my holy place unclean with all your hated things and all your disgusting ways you will become disgusting to me my eye will have no mercy and i will have no pity
 a third of you will come to death from disease wasting away among you through need of food a third will be put to the sword round about you and a third i will send away to every wind letting loose a sword after them
 so my wrath will be complete and my passion will come to rest on them and they will be certain that i the lord have given the word of decision when my wrath against them is complete
 and i will make you a waste and a name of shame among the nations round about you in the eyes of everyone who goes by
 and you will be a name of shame and a cause of bitter words an example and a wonder to the nations round about you when i give effect to my judging among you in wrath and in passion and in burning protests i the lord have said it
 when i send on you the evil arrows of disease causing destruction which i will send to put an end to you and further i will take away your necessary food
 and i will send on you need of food and evil beasts and they will be a cause of loss to you and disease and violent death will go through you and i will send the sword on you i the lord have said it
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the mountains of israel and be a prophet to them and say
 you mountains of israel give ear to the words of the lord this is what the lord has said to the mountains and the hills to the waterways and the valleys see i even i am sending on you a sword for the destruction of your high places
 and your altars will be made waste and your sun images will be broken and i will have your dead men placed before your images
 and i will put the dead bodies of the children of israel in front of their images sending your bones in all directions about your altars
 in all your living places the towns will become broken walls and the high places made waste so that your altars may be broken down and made waste and your images broken and ended and so that your sun images may be cut down and your works rubbed out
 and the dead will be falling down among you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 but still i will keep a small band safe from the sword among the nations when you are sent wandering among the countries
 and those of you who are kept safe will have me in mind among the nations where they have been taken away as prisoners how i sent punishment on their hearts which were untrue to me and on their eyes which were turned to their false gods and they will be full of hate for themselves because of the evil things which they have done in all their disgusting ways
 and they will be certain that i am the lord not for nothing did i say that i would do this evil to them
 this is what the lord has said give blows with your hand stamping with your foot and say o sorrow  because of all the evil and disgusting ways of the children of israel for death will overtake them by the sword and through need of food and by disease
 he who is far away will come to his death by disease he who is near will be put to the sword he who is shut up will come to his death through need of food and i will give full effect to my passion against them
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when their dead men are stretched among their images round about their altars on every high hill on all the tops of the mountains and under every branching tree and under every thick oak tree the places where they made sweet smells to all their images
 and my hand will be stretched out against them making the land waste and unpeopled from the waste land to riblah through all their living places and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 and you son of man say this is what the lord has said to the land of israel an end has come the end has come on the four quarters of the land
 now the end has come on you and i will send my wrath on you judging you for your ways i will send punishment on you for all your disgusting acts
