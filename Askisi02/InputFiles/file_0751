 suddenly they come to an end even in the middle of the night the blow comes on the men of wealth and they are gone and the strong are taken away without the hand of man
 for his eyes are on the ways of a man and he sees all his steps
 there is no dark place and no thick cloud in which the workers of evil may take cover
 for he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged
 he sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause and puts others in their place
 for he has knowledge of their works overturning them in the night so that they are crushed
 the evil doers are broken by his wrath he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers
 because they did not go after him and took no note of his ways
 so that the cry of the poor might come up to him and the prayer of those in need come to his ears
 
 
 
 
 
 men of knowledge and all wise men hearing me will say
 jobs words do not come from knowledge they are not the fruit of wisdom
 may job be tested to the end because his answers have been like those of evil men
 for in addition to his sin he is uncontrolled in heart before our eyes he makes sport of god increasing his words against him
 and elihu made answer and said
 does it seem to you to be right and righteousness before god to say
 what profit is it to me and how am i better off than if i had done wrong
 i will make answer to you and to your friends
 let your eyes be turned to the heavens and lifted up to see the skies they are higher than you
 if you have done wrong is he any the worse for it and if your sins are great in number what is it to him
 if you are upright what do you give to him or what does he take from your hand
 your evil doing may have an effect on a man like yourself or your righteousness on a son of man
 because the hand of the cruel is hard on them men are making sounds of grief they are crying out for help because of the arm of the strong
 but no one has said where is god my maker who gives songs in the night
 who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heaven
 there they are crying out because of the pride of the evil doers but he gives them no answer
