 like birds with outstretched wings so will the lord of armies be a cover to jerusalem he will be a cover and salvation for it going over it he will keep it from danger
 come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of israel
 for in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold the sin which they made for themselves
 then the assyrian will come down by the sword but not of man the sword not of men will be the cause of his destruction and he will go in flight from the sword and his young men will be put to forced work
 and his rock will come to nothing because of fear and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag says the lord whose fire is in zion and his altar in jerusalem
 see a king will be ruling in righteousness and chiefs will give right decisions
 and a man will be as a safe place from the wind and a cover from the storm as rivers of water in a dry place as the shade of a great rock in a waste land
 and the eyes of those who see will not be shut and those who have hearing will give ear to the word
 the man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly
 the foolish man will no longer be named noble and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour
 for the foolish man will say foolish things having evil thoughts in his heart working what is unclean and talking falsely about the lord to keep food from him who is in need of it and water from him whose soul is desiring it
 the designs of the false are evil purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words even when he is in the right
 but the noble hearted man has noble purposes and by these he will be guided
 give ear to my voice you women who are living in comfort give attention to my words you daughters who have no fear of danger
 in not much more than a year you who are not looking for evil will be troubled for the produce of the vine gardens will be cut off and there will be no getting in of the grapes
 be shaking with fear you women who are living in comfort be troubled you who have no fear of danger take off your robes and put on clothing of grief
 have sorrow for the fields the pleasing fields the fertile vine
 and for the land of my people where thorns will come up even for all the houses of joy in the glad town
 for the fair houses will have no man living in them the town which was full of noise will become a waste the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever a joy for the asses of the woods a place of food for the flocks
 till the spirit comes on us from on high and the waste land becomes a fertile field and the fertile field is changed into a wood
 then in the waste land there will be an upright rule and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field
 and the work of righteousness will be peace and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever
 and my people will be living in peace in houses where there is no fear and in quiet resting places
 but the tall trees will come down with a great fall and the town will be low in a low place
 happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters and sending out the ox and the ass
 ho  you who make waste those who did not make you waste acting falsely to those who were not false to you when you have come to an end of wasting you will be made waste and after your false acts they will do the same to you
 o lord have mercy on us for we have been waiting for your help be our strength every morning our salvation in time of trouble
 at the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions
 and the goods taken in war will be got together like the massing of young locusts men will be rushing on them like the rushing of locusts
 the lord is lifted up his place is on high he has made zion full of righteousness and true religion
