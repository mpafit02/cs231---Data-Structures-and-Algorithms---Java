 and when the children of ammon made war against israel the responsible men of gilead went to get jephthah back from the land of tob
 and they said to jephthah come and be our chief so that we may make war against the children of ammon
 but jephthah said to the responsible men of gilead did you not in your hate for me send me away from my fathers house why do you come to me now when you are in trouble
 and the responsible men of gilead said to jephthah that is the reason we have come back to you so go with us and make war against the children of ammon and we will make you our head over all the people of gilead
 then jephthah said to the responsible men of gilead if you take me back to make war against the children of ammon and if with the help of the lord i overcome them will you make me your head
 and the responsible men of gilead said to jephthah may the lord be our witness we will certainly do as you say
 so jephthah went with the responsible men of gilead and the people made him head and chief over them and jephthah said all these things before the lord in mizpah
 then jephthah sent men to the king of the children of ammon saying what have you against me that you have come to make war against my land
 and the king of the children of ammon said to the men sent by jephthah because israel when he came up out of egypt took away my land from the arnon as far as the jabbok and as far as jordan so now give me back those lands quietly
 and jephthah sent again to the king of the children of ammon
 and said to him this is the word of jephthah israel did not take away the land of moab or the land of the children of ammon
 but when they came up from egypt israel went through the waste land to the red sea and came to kadesh
 then israel sent men to the king of edom saying let me now go through your land but the king of edom did not give ear to them and in the same way he sent to the king of moab but he would not so israel went on living in kadesh
 then he went on through the waste land and round the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and put up their tents on the other side of the arnon they did not come inside the limit of moab for the arnon was the limit of moab
 and israel sent men to sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said to him let me now go through your land to my place
 but sihon would not give way and let israel go through his land and sihon got together all his people and put his army in position in jahaz and made war on israel
 and the lord the god of israel gave sihon and all his people into the hands of israel and they overcame them so all the land of the amorites the people of that land became israels
 all the limit of the amorites was theirs from the arnon as far as the jabbok and from the waste land even to jordan
 so now the lord the god of israel has taken away their land from the amorites and given it to his people israel are you then to have it
 do you not keep the lands of those whom chemosh your god sends out from before you so we will keep all the lands of those whom the lord our god sends out from before us
 what  are you any better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever take up a cause against israel or make war against them
 while israel was living in heshbon and its daughter towns and in aroer and its daughter towns and in all the towns which are by the side of the arnon for three hundred years why did you not get them back at that time
 so i have done no wrong against you but you are doing wrong to me in fighting against me may the lord who is judge this day be judge between the children of israel and the children of ammon
 the king of the children of ammon however did not give ear to the words which jephthah sent to him
 then the spirit of the lord came on jephthah and he went through gilead and manasseh and came to mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he went over to the children of ammon
 and jephthah took an oath to the lord and said if you will give the children of ammon into my hands
 then whoever comes out from the door of my house meeting me when i come back in peace from the children of ammon will be the lords and i will give him as a burned offering
 so jephthah went over to the children of ammon to make war on them and the lord gave them into his hands
 and he made an attack on them from aroer all the way to minnith overrunning twenty towns as far as abel cheramim and put great numbers to the sword so the children of ammon were crushed before the children of israel
 then jephthah came back to his house in mizpah and his daughter came out meeting him on his way with music and with dances she was his only child he had no other sons or daughters
