 may a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing
 or may one go on lighted coals and his feet not be burned
 so it is with him who goes in to his neighbours wife he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment
 men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it
 but if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much giving up all his property which is in his house
 he who takes another mans wife is without all sense he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul
 wounds will be his and loss of honour and his shame may not be washed away
 for bitter is the wrath of an angry husband in the day of punishment he will have no mercy
 he will not take any payment and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased
 my son keep my sayings and let my rules be stored up with you
 keep my rules and you will have life let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes
 let them be fixed to your fingers and recorded in your heart
 say to wisdom you are my sister let knowledge be named your special friend
 so that they may keep you from the strange woman even from her whose words are smooth
 looking out from my house and watching through the window
 i saw among the young men one without sense
 walking in the street near the turn of her road going on the way to her house
 at nightfall in the evening of the day in the black dark of the night
 and the woman came out to him in the dress of a loose woman with a designing heart
 she is full of noise and uncontrolled her feet keep not in her house
 now she is in the street now in the open spaces waiting at every turning of the road
 so she took him by his hand kissing him and without a sign of shame she said to him
 i have a feast of peace offerings for today my oaths have been effected
 so i came out in the hope of meeting you looking for you with care and now i have you
 my bed is covered with cushions of needlework with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of egypt
 i have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices
 come let us take our pleasure in love till the morning having joy in loves delights
 for the master of the house is away on a long journey
 he has taken a bag of money with him he is coming back at the full moon
 with her fair words she overcame him forcing him with her smooth lips
