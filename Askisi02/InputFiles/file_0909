 for their feet are running after evil and they are quick to take a mans life
 truly to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird
 and they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves
 such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit it takes away the life of its owners
 wisdom is crying out in the street her voice is loud in the open places
 her words are sounding in the meeting places and in the doorways of the town
 how long you simple ones will foolish things be dear to you and pride a delight to the haters of authority how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge
 be turned again by my sharp words see i will send the flow of my spirit on you and make my words clear to you
 because your ears were shut to my voice no one gave attention to my out stretched hand
 you were not controlled by my guiding and would have nothing to do with my sharp words
 so in the day of your trouble i will be laughing i will make sport of your fear
 when your fear comes on you like a storm and your trouble like a rushing wind when pain and sorrow come on you
 then i will give no answer to their cries searching for me early they will not see me
 for they were haters of knowledge and did not give their hearts to the fear of the lord
 they had no desire for my teaching and my words of protest were as nothing to them
 so the fruit of their way will be their food and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full
 for the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction
 but whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely living in peace without fear of evil
 a wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother
 wealth which comes from sin is of no profit but righteousness gives salvation from death
 the lord will not let the upright be in need of food but he puts far from him the desire of the evil doers
 he who is slow in his work becomes poor but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth
 he who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame
 blessings are on the head of the upright but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow
 the memory of the upright is a blessing but the name of the evil doer will be turned to dust
 the wise hearted man will let himself be ruled but the man whose talk is foolish will have a fall
 he whose ways are upright will go safely but he whose ways are twisted will be made low
 he who makes signs with his eyes is a cause of trouble but he who makes a man see his errors is a cause of peace
 the mouth of the upright man is a fountain of life but the mouth of the evil doer is a bitter cup
 hate is a cause of violent acts but all errors are covered up by love
