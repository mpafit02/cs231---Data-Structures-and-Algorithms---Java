 and you came down on mount sinai and your voice came to them from heaven giving them right decisions and true laws good rules and orders
 and you gave them word of your holy sabbath and gave them orders and rules and a law by the hand of moses your servant
 and you gave them bread from heaven when they were in need and made water come out of the rock for their drink and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which your hand had been lifted up to give them
 but they and our fathers in their pride made their necks stiff and gave no attention to your orders
 and would not do them and gave no thought to the wonders you had done among them but made their necks stiff and turning away from you made a captain over themselves to take them back to their prison in egypt but you are a god of forgiveness full of grace and pity slow to wrath and great in mercy and you did not give them up
 even when they had made for themselves an ox of metal and said this is your god who took you up out of egypt and had done so much to make you angry
 even then in your great mercy you did not give them up in the waste land the pillar of cloud still went before them by day guiding them on their way and the pillar of fire by night to give them light and make clear the way they were to go
 and you gave your good spirit to be their teacher and did not keep back your manna from their mouths and gave them water when they had need of it
 truly for forty years you were their support in the waste land and they were in need of nothing their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired
 and you gave them kingdoms and peoples making distribution to them in every part of the land so they took for their heritage the land of sihon even the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan
 and you made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven and took them into the land of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves
 so the children went in and took the land and you overcame before them the people of the land the canaanites and gave them up into their hands with their kings and the people of the land so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do
 and they took walled towns and a fat land and became the owners of houses full of all good things water holes cut in the rock vine gardens and olive gardens and a wealth of fruit trees so they had food enough and became fat and had joy in the good you gave them
 but they were hard hearted and went against your authority turning their backs on your law and putting to death your prophets who gave witness against them with the purpose of turning them back again to you and they did much to make you angry
 and so you gave them up into the hands of their haters who were cruel to them and in the time of their trouble when they made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven and in your great mercy gave them saviours who made them free from the hands of their haters
 but when they had rest they did evil again before you so you gave them into the hands of their haters who had rule over them but when they came back and made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven again and again in your mercy you gave them salvation
 and gave witness against them so that you might make them come back again to your law but their hearts were lifted up and they gave no attention to your orders and went against your decisions  which if a man keeps them will be life to him  and turning their backs on you made their necks stiff and did not give ear
 year after year you put up with them and gave witness against them by your spirit through your prophets still they did not give ear and so you gave them up into the hands of the peoples of the lands
 even then in your great mercy you did not put an end to them completely or give them up for you are a god of grace and mercy
 and now our god the great the strong the god who is to be feared who keeps faith and mercy let not all this trouble seem small to you which has come on us and on our kings and our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on all your people from the time of the kings of assyria till this day
 but still you have been in the right in everything which has come on us you have been true to us but we have done evil
 and our kings our rulers our priests and our fathers have not kept your law or given attention to your orders and your witness with which you gave witness against them
 for they have not been your servants in their kingdom and in all the good things you gave them and in the great and fat land you gave them and they have not been turned away from their evil doing
 now today we are servants and as for the land which you gave to our fathers so that the produce of it and the good might be theirs see we are servants in it
 and it gives much increase to the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins and they have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great trouble
 and because of all this we are making an agreement in good faith and putting it in writing and our rulers our levites and our priests are putting their names to it
 and the lord said to moses in the waste land of sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they came out of the land of egypt
 take the full number of the children of israel by their families and by their fathers houses every male by name
 all those of twenty years old and over who are able to go to war in israel are to be numbered by you and aaron
 and to give you help take one man from every tribe the head of his fathers house
