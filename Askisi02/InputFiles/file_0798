 so they went on their way again putting the little ones and the oxen and the goods in front of them
 when they had gone some way from the house of micah the men from the houses near micahs house came together and overtook the children of dan
 crying out to them and the danites turning round said to micah what is your trouble that you have taken up arms
 and he said you have taken my gods which i made and my priest and have gone away what is there for me now why then do you say to me what is your trouble
 and the children of dan said to him say no more or men of bitter spirit may make an attack on you causing loss of your life and the lives of your people
 then the children of dan went on their way and when micah saw that they were stronger than he he went back to his house
 and they took that which micah had made and his priest and came to laish to a people living quietly and without thought of danger and they put them to the sword without mercy burning down their town
 and they had no saviour because it was far from zidon and they had no business with aram and it was in the valley which is the property of beth rehob and building up the town again they took it for their living place
 and they gave the town the name of dan after dan their father who was the son of israel though the town had been named laish at first
  and the children of dan put up the pictured image for themselves and jonathan the son of gershom the son of moses and his sons were priests for the tribe of the danites till the day when the ark was taken prisoner 
 and they put up for themselves the image which micah had made and it was there all the time that the house of god was in shiloh
 now in those days when there was no king in israel a certain levite was living in the inmost parts of the hill country of ephraim and he got for himself a servant wife from beth lehem judah
 and his servant wife was angry with him and went away from him to her fathers house at beth lehem judah and was there for four months
 then her husband got up and went after her with the purpose of talking kindly to her and taking her back with him he had with him his young man and two asses and she took him into her fathers house and her father when he saw him came forward to him with joy
 and his father in law the girls father kept him there for three days and they had food and drink and took their rest there
 now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning and he made ready to go away but the girls father said to his son in law take a little food to keep up your strength and then go on your way
 so seating themselves they had food and drink the two of them together and the girls father said to the man if it is your pleasure take your rest here tonight and let your heart be glad
 and the man got up to go away but his father in law would not let him go so he took his rest there again for the night
 then early on the morning of the fifth day he got up to go away but the girls father said keep up your strength so the two of them had a meal and the man and his woman and his servant did not go till after the middle of the day
 and when they got up to go away his father in law the girls father said to him now evening is coming on so do not go tonight see the day is almost gone take your rest here and let your heart be glad and tomorrow early go on your way back to your house
 but the man would not be kept there that night and he got up and went away and came opposite to jebus  which is jerusalem  and he had with him the two asses ready for travelling and his woman
 when they got near jebus the day was far gone and the servant said to his master now let us go from our road into this town of the jebusites and take our nights rest there
 but his master said to him we will not go out of our way into a strange town whose people are not of the children of israel but we will go on to gibeah
 and he said to his servant come let us go on to one of these places stopping for the night in gibeah or ramah
 so they went on their way and the sun went down when they were near gibeah in the land of benjamin
 and they went off the road there with the purpose of stopping for the night in gibeah and he went in seating himself in the street of the town for no one took them into his house for the night
 now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields he was from the hill country of ephraim and was living in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites
 and when he saw the traveller in the street of the town the old man said where are you going and where do you come from
 and he said to him we are on our way from beth lehem judah to the inmost parts of the hill country of ephraim i came from there and went to beth lehem judah now i am on my way back to my house but no man will take me into his house
 but we have dry grass and food for our asses as well as bread and wine for me and for the woman and for the young man with us we have no need of anything
