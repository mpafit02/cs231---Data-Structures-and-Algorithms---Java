 and jesus stopping sent for them and said what would you have me do to you
 they say to him lord that our eyes may be open
 and jesus being moved with pity put his fingers on their eyes and straight away they were able to see and went after him
 and when they were near jerusalem and had come to beth phage to the mountain of olives jesus sent two disciples
 saying to them go into the little town in front of you and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck and a young one with her let them loose and come with them to me
 and if anyone says anything to you you will say the lord has need of them and straight away he will send them
 now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true
 say to the daughter of zion see your king comes to you gentle and seated on an ass and on a young ass
 and the disciples went and did as jesus had given them orders
 and got the ass and the young one and put their clothing on them and he took his seat on it
 and all the people put their clothing down in the way and others got branches from the trees and put them down in the way
 and those who went before him and those who came after gave loud cries saying glory to the son of david a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord glory in the highest
 and when he came into jerusalem all the town was moved saying who is this
 and the people said this is the prophet jesus from nazareth of galilee
 and jesus went into the temple and sent out all who were trading there overturning the tables of the money changers and the seats of those trading in doves
 and he said to them it is in the writings my house is to be named a house of prayer but you are making it a hole of thieves
 and the blind and the broken in body came to him in the temple and he made them well
 but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did and the children crying out in the temple glory to the son of david they were angry and said to him
 have you any idea what these are saying and jesus said to them yes have you not seen in the writings from the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete
 and he went away from them and went out of the town to bethany and was there for the night
 now in the morning when he was coming back to the town he had a desire for food
 and seeing a fig tree by the wayside he came to it and saw nothing on it but leaves only and he said to it let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever and straight away the fig tree became dry and dead
 and when the disciples saw it they were surprised saying how did the fig tree become dry in so short a time
 and jesus in answer said to them truly i say to you if you have faith without doubting not only may you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be taken up and put into the sea it will be done
 and all things whatever you make request for in prayer having faith you will get
 and when he had come into the temple the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching and said by what authority do you do these things and who gave you this authority
 and jesus said to them in answer i will put one question to you and if you give me the answer i will say by what authority i do these things
 the baptism of john where did it come from from heaven or from men and they were reasoning among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not have faith in him
 but if we say from men we are in fear of the people because all take john to be a prophet
 and they made answer and said we have no idea then he said to them and i will not say to you by what authority i do these things
