 now the place in the book where he was reading was this he was taken like a sheep to be put to death and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut so he made no sound
 being of low degree his cause was not given a hearing who has knowledge of his family for his life is cut off from the earth
 and the ethiopian said to philip about whom are these words said by the prophet about himself or some other
 so philip starting from this writing gave him the good news about jesus
 and while they were going on their way they came to some water and the ethiopian said see here is water why may i not have baptism
   
 and he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped and the two of them went down into the water and philip gave him baptism
 and when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord took philip away and the ethiopian saw him no more for he went on his way full of joy
 but philip came to azotus and went through all the towns preaching the good news till he came to caesarea
 but saul still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
 and made a request for letters from him to the synagogues of damascus so that if there were any of the way there men or women he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem
 and while he was journeying he came near damascus and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him
 and he went down on the earth and a voice said to him saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
 and he said who are you lord and he said i am jesus whom you are attacking
 but get up and go into the town and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
 and the men who were with him were not able to say anything hearing the voice but seeing no one
 and saul got up from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw nothing and he was guided by the hand into damascus
 and for three days he was not able to see and he took no food or drink
 now there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and the lord said to him in a vision ananias  and he said here i am lord
 and the lord said to him get up and go to the street which is named straight and make search at the house of judas for one named saul of tarsus for he is at prayer
 and he has seen a man named ananias coming in and putting his hands on him so that he may be able to see
 but ananias said lord i have had accounts of this man from a number of people how much evil he has done to your saints at jerusalem
 and here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name
 but the lord said go without fear for he is a special vessel for me to give to the gentiles and kings and to the children of israel the knowledge of my name
 for i will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me
 and ananias went out and came to the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord jesus whom you saw when you were on your journey has sent me so that you may be able to see and be full of the holy spirit
 and straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes and he was able to see and he got up and had baptism
 and when he had taken food his strength came back and for some days he kept with the disciples who were in damascus
 and straight away in the synagogues he was preaching jesus as the son of god
 and all those hearing him were full of wonder and said is not this the man who in jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests
