 i have taken the way of faith i have kept your decisions before me
 i have been true to your unchanging word o lord do not put me to shame
 i will go quickly in the way of your teaching because you have given me a free heart
 &lthe&gt o lord let me see the way of your rules and i will keep it to the end
 give me wisdom so that i may keep your law going after it with all my heart
 make me go in the way of your teachings for they are my delight
 let my heart be turned to your unchanging word and not to evil desire
 let my eyes be turned away from what is false give me life in your ways
 give effect to your word to your servant in whose heart is the fear of you
 take away the shame which is my fear for your decisions are good
 see how great is my desire for your orders give me life in your righteousness
 &ltvau&gt let your mercies come to me o lord even your salvation as you have said
 so that i may have an answer for the man who would put me to shame for i have faith in your word
 take not your true word quite out of my mouth for i have put my hope in your decisions
 so that i may keep your law for ever and ever
 so that my way may be in a wide place because my search has been for your orders
 so that i may give knowledge of your unchanging word before kings and not be put to shame
 and so that i may take delight in your teachings to which i have given my love
 and so that my hands may be stretched out to you and i will give thought to your rules
 &ltzain&gt keep in mind your word to your servant for on it has my hope been fixed
 this is my comfort in my trouble that your sayings have given me life
 the men of pride have made great sport of me but i have not been turned from your law
 i have kept the memory of your decisions from times past o lord and they have been my comfort
 i am burning with wrath because of the sinners who have given up your law
 your rules have been melodies to me while i have been living in strange lands
 i have given thought to your name in the night o lord and have kept your law
 this has been true of me that i have kept your orders in my heart
 &ltcheth&gt the lord is my heritage i have said that i would be ruled by your words
 i have given my mind to do your pleasure with all my heart have mercy on me as you have said
 i gave thought to my steps and my feet were turned into the way of your unchanging word
