 and azariah the chief priest of the family of zadok said in answer from the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the lord we have had food enough and more than enough for the blessing of the lord is on his people and there is this great store which has not been used
 then hezekiah said that store rooms were to be made ready in the house of the lord and this was done
 and in them they put all the offerings and the tenths and the holy things keeping nothing back and over them was conaniah the levite with shimei his brother second to him
 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the directions of conaniah and shimei his brother by the order of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god
 and kore the son of imnah the levite the keeper of the east door had control of the offerings freely given to god and the distribution of the offerings of the lord and the most holy things
 and under him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah and amariah and shecaniah in the towns of the priests who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers by divisions to small and great
 as well as to all the males of three years old and over listed by their families who went into the house of the lord to do what was needed day by day for their special work with their divisions
 and the families of the priests were listed by their fathers names but the levites of twenty years old and over were listed in relation to their work in their divisions
 and in the lists were all their little ones and their wives and their sons and daughters through all the people they made themselves holy in the positions which they were given
 and as for the sons of aaron the priests living in the country on the outskirts of their towns every different town there were men marked out by name to give their part of the goods to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed among the levites
 this hezekiah did through all judah he did what was good and right and true before the lord his god
 and for everything he undertook in connection with the work of the house of god and his law and orders he got directions from god and did it with serious purpose and things went well for him
 now after these things and this true hearted work sennacherib king of assyria came into judah and put his army in position before the walled towns of judah designing to make his way into them by force
 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib had come for the purpose of fighting against jerusalem
 he took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the water springs outside the town and they gave him their support
 so they got together a great number of people and had all the water springs and the stream flowing through the land stopped up saying why let the kings of assyria come and have much water
 then he took heart building up the wall where it was broken down and making its towers higher and building another wall outside and he made strong the millo in the town of david and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments of war
 and he put war chiefs over the people and sent for them all to come together to him in the wide place at the doorway into the town and to give them heart he said to them
 be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled on account of the king of assyria and all the great army with him for there is a greater with us
 with him is an arm of flesh but we have the lord our god helping us and fighting for us and the people put their faith in what hezekiah king of judah said
 after this sennacherib king of assyria sent his servants to jerusalem  at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of lachish  to say to hezekiah and all the men of judah in jerusalem
 sennacherib king of assyria says in what are you placing your hope waiting here in the walled town of jerusalem
 is it not hezekiah who has got you to do it causing your death from need of food and water by saying the lord our god will give us salvation out of the hands of the king of assyria
 has not this same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars saying to judah and jerusalem give worship before one altar only burning offerings on it
 have you no knowledge of what i and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands
 who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers put to destruction who was able to keep his people safe from my hands and is it possible that your god will keep you safe from my hands
 so do not be tricked by hezekiah or let him get you to do this and do not put any faith in what he says for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands or the hands of my fathers how much less will your god keep you safe from my hands 
 and his servants said even more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah
 and he sent letters in addition to put shame on the lord the god of israel and to say evil against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not been able to keep their people safe from my hands no more will the god of hezekiah keep his people safe from my hands
 these things they said crying out with a loud voice in the jews language to the people of jerusalem who were on the wall with the purpose of troubling them and putting fear into them so that they might take the town
