 the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim
 so they went on worshipping the lord and made for themselves from among all the people priests for the high places to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places
 they gave worship to the lord but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners
 so to this day they go on in their old ways not worshipping the lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the lord gave to the children of jacob to whom he gave the name israel
 and the lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders saying you are to have no other gods you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings
 but the lord who took you out of the land of egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm he is your god to whom you are to give worship and make offerings
 and the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you you are to keep and do for ever you are to have no other gods
 and you are to keep in memory the agreement which i have made with you and you are to have no other gods
 and you are to give worship to the lord your god for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you
 but they gave no attention but went on in their old way
 so these nations worshipping the lord still were servants to the images they had made their children and their childrens children did the same as their fathers did so do they to this day
 now in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel hezekiah the son of ahaz became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was abi the daughter of zechariah
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as david his father had done
 he had the high places taken away and the stone pillars broken to bits and the asherah cut down and the brass snake which moses had made was crushed to powder at his order because in those days the children of israel had offerings burned before it and he gave it the name nehushtan
 he had faith in the lord the god of israel so that there was no one like him among all the kings of judah who were before him
 for his heart was fixed on the lord not turning from his ways and he did his orders which the lord gave to moses
 and the lord was with him he did well in all his undertakings and he took up arms against the king of assyria and was his servant no longer
 he overcame the philistines as far as gaza and its limits from the tower of the watchman to the walled town
 now in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria shutting it in with his armies
 and at the end of three years they took it in the sixth year of hezekiahs rule which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken
 and the king of assyria took israel away as prisoners into assyria placing them in halah and in habor on the river gozan and in the towns of the medes
 because they did not give ear to the voice of the lord their god but went against his agreement even against everything ordered by moses the servant of the lord and they did not give ear to it or do it
 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the walled towns of judah and took them
 and hezekiah king of judah sent to lachish to the king of assyria saying i have done wrong give up attacking me and whatever you put on me i will undergo and the payment he was to make was fixed by the king of assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
 so hezekiah gave him all the silver in the house of the lord and in the kings store house
 and at that time hezekiah had the gold from the doors of the lords house and from the door pillars plated by him cut off and gave it to the king of assyria
 then the king of assyria sent the tartan and the rab saris and the rab shakeh from lachish to jerusalem to king hezekiah with a strong force and they went up and came to jerusalem and took up their position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans field
 and they sent for the king and eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came out to them
 and the rab shakeh said to them say now to hezekiah these are the words of the great king the king of assyria in what are you placing your hope
