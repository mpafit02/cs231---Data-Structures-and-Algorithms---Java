 every place where you put your foot will be yours from the waste land and lebanon from the river the river euphrates as far as the great sea will be the limits of your land
 all people will give way before you for the lord your god will put the fear of you on all the land through which you go as he has said
 today i put before you a blessing and a curse
 the blessing if you give ear to the orders of the lord your god which i give you this day
 and the curse if you do not give ear to the orders of the lord your god but let yourselves be turned from the way which i have put before you this day and go after other gods which are not yours
 and when the lord your god has taken you into the land of your heritage you are to put the blessing on mount gerizim and the curse on mount ebal
 are they not on the other side of jordan looking west in the land of the canaanites living in the arabah opposite gilgal by the holy tree of moreh
 for you are about to go over jordan to take the heritage which the lord your god is giving you and it will be your resting place
 and you are to take care to keep all the laws and the decisions which i put before you today
 these are the laws and the decisions which you are to keep with care in the land which the lord the god of your fathers has given you to be your heritage all the days of your life on earth
 you are to give up to the curse all those places where the nations whom you are driving out gave worship to their gods on the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree
 their altars and their pillars are to be broken down and their holy trees burned with fire and the images of their gods cut down you are to take away their names out of that place
 do not so to the lord your god
 but let your hearts be turned to the place which will be marked out by the lord your god among your tribes to put his name there
 and there you are to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up to the lord and the offerings of your oaths and those which you give freely from the impulse of your hearts and the first births among your herds and your flocks
 there you and all your families are to make a feast before the lord your god with joy in everything to which you put your hand because the lord has given you his blessing
 you are not to do things then in the way in which we now do them here every man as it seems right to him
 for you have not come to the rest and the heritage which the lord your god is giving you
 but when you have gone over jordan and are living in the land which the lord your god is giving you as your heritage and when he has given you rest from all those on every side who are fighting against you and you are living there safely
 then there will be a place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place for his name and there you will take all the things which i give you orders to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up and the offerings of your oaths which you make to the lord
 and you will be glad before the lord your god you and your sons and your daughters and your men servants and your women servants and the levite who is with you in your house because he has no part or heritage among you
 take care that you do not make your burned offerings in any place you see
 but in the place marked out by the lord in one of your tribes there let your burned offerings be offered and there do what i have given you orders to do
 only you may put to death animals such as the gazelle or the roe for your food in any of your towns at the desire of your soul in keeping with the blessing of the lord your god which he has given you the unclean and the clean may take of it
 but you may not take the blood for food it is to be drained out on the earth like water
 in your towns you are not to take as food the tenth part of your grain or of your wine or your oil or the first births of your herds or of your flocks or anything offered under an oath or freely offered to the lord or given as a lifted offering
 but they will be your food before the lord your god in the place of his selection where you may make a feast of them with your son and your daughter and your man servant and your woman servant and the levite who is living with you and you will have joy before the lord your god in everything to which you put your hand
 see that you do not give up caring for the levite as long as you are living in your land
 when the lord your god makes wide the limit of your land as he has said and you say i will take flesh for my food because you have a desire for it then you may take whatever flesh you have a desire for
 if the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place for his name is far away from you then take from your herds and from your flocks which the lord has given you as i have said and have a meal of it in the towns where you may be living
