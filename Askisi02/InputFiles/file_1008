 so their days were wasted like a breath and their years in trouble
 when he sent death on them then they made search for him turning to him and looking for him with care
 in the memory that god was their rock and the most high god their saviour
 but their lips were false to him and their tongues were untrue to him
 and their hearts were not right with him and they did not keep their agreement with him
 but he being full of pity has forgiveness for sin and does not put an end to man frequently turning back his wrath and not being violently angry
 so he kept in mind that they were only flesh a breath which is quickly gone and will not come again
 how frequently did they go against him in the waste land and give him cause for grief in the dry places 
 again they put god to the test and gave pain to the holy one of israel
 they did not keep in mind the work of his hand or the day when he took them from the power of their haters
 how he had done his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan
 so that their rivers were turned to blood and they were not able to get drink from their streams
 he sent different sorts of flies among them poisoning their flesh and frogs for their destruction
 he gave the increase of their fields to worms the fruits of their industry to the locusts
 he sent ice for the destruction of their vines their trees were damaged by the bitter cold
 ice was rained down on their cattle thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks
 he sent on them the heat of his wrath his bitter disgust letting loose evil angels among them
 he let his wrath have its way he did not keep back their soul from death but gave their life to disease
 he gave to destruction all the first sons of egypt the first fruits of their strength in the tents of ham
 but he took his people out like sheep guiding them in the waste land like a flock
 he took them on safely so that they had no fear but their haters were covered by the sea
 and he was their guide to his holy land even to the mountain which his right hand had made his
 driving out nations before them marking out the line of their heritage and giving the people of israel their tents for a resting place
 but they were bitter against the most high god testing him and not keeping his laws
 their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers they were turned to one side like a twisted bow
 they made him angry with their high places moving him to wrath with their images
 when this came to gods ears he was very angry and gave up israel completely
 so that he went away from the holy place in shiloh the tent which he had put among men
 and he let his strength be taken prisoner and gave his glory into the hands of his hater
 he gave his people up to the sword and was angry with his heritage
