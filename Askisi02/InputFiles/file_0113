 have you not faith that i am in the father and the father is in me the words which i say to you i say not from myself but the father who is in me all the time does his works
 have faith that i am in the father and that the father is in me at least have faith in me because of what i do
 truly i say to you he who puts his faith in me will do the very works which i do and he will do greater things than these because i am going to my father
 and whatever request you make in my name that i will do so that the father may have glory in the son
 if you make any request to me in my name i will do it
 if you have love for me you will keep my laws
 and i will make prayer to the father and he will give you another helper to be with you for ever
 even the spirit of true knowledge that spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him but you have knowledge of him because he is ever with you and will be in you
 i will not let you be without a friend i am coming to you
 a little time longer and the world will see me no more but you will see me and you will be living because i am living
 at that time it will be clear to you that i am in my father and you are in me and i in you
 he who has my laws and keeps them he it is who has love for me and he who has love for me will be loved by my father and i will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him
 judas  not iscariot  said to him how is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world
 jesus said to him in answer if anyone has love for me he will keep my words and he will be dear to my father and we will come to him and make our living place with him
 he who has no love for me does not keep my words and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the fathers who sent me
 i have said all this to you while i am still with you
 but the helper the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything i have said to you
 may peace be with you my peace i give to you i give it not as the world gives let not your heart be troubled let it be without fear
 keep in mind how i said to you i go away and come to you again if you had love for me you would be glad because i am going to the father for the father is greater than i
 and now i have given you word of it before it comes so that when it comes you may have faith
 after this i will not say much to you because the ruler of this world comes and he has no power over me
 but he comes so that the world may see that i have love for the father and that i am doing as i am ordered by the father get up and let us go
 i am the true vine and my father is the gardener
 he takes away every branch in me which has no fruit and every branch which has fruit he makes clean so that it may have more fruit
 you are clean even now through the teaching which i have given you
 be in me at all times as i am in you as the branch is not able to give fruit of itself if it is not still on the vine so you are not able to do so if you are not in me
 i am the vine you are the branches he who is in me at all times as i am in him gives much fruit because without me you are able to do nothing
 if a man does not keep himself in me he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned
 if you are in me at all times and my words are in you then anything for which you make a request will be done for you
 here is my fathers glory in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples
