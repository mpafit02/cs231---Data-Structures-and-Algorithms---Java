 and cornelius said four days from now i was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour and i saw before me a man in shining clothing
 who said cornelius your prayer has come to the ears of god and your offerings are kept in his memory
 send then to joppa and get simon named peter to come to you he is living in the house of simon a leather worker by the sea
 so straight away i sent for you and you have done well to come and now we are all present before god ready to give attention to all the things which the lord has given you to say
 then peter said truly i see clearly that god is no respecter of persons
 but in every nation the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him
 the word which he sent to the children of israel giving the good news of peace through jesus christ  who is lord of all   
 that word you yourselves have knowledge of which was made public through all judaea starting from galilee after the baptism of which john was the preacher
 about jesus of nazareth how god gave the holy spirit to him with power and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits for god was with him
 and we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the jews and in jerusalem whom they put to death hanging him on a tree
 on the third day god gave him back to life and let him be seen
 not by all the people but by witnesses marked out before by god even by us who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead
 and he gave us orders to give news of this to the people and to give public witness that this is he whom god has made judge of the living and the dead
 to him all the prophets give witness that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins
 while peter was saying these words the holy spirit came on all those who were hearing the word
 and the jews of the faith who had come with peter were full of wonder because the holy spirit was given to the gentiles
 and they were talking in tongues and giving glory to god then peter said
 will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the holy spirit as we have
 and he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of jesus christ then they kept him with them for some days
 now the apostles and the brothers who were in judaea had news that the word of god had been given to the gentiles
 and when peter came to jerusalem those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him
 saying you went to men without circumcision and took food with them
 but peter gave them an account of it all in order saying to them
 i was in the town of joppa at prayer and falling into a deep sleep i saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven and it came down to me
 and looking on it with attention i saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds
 and a voice came to my ears saying come peter take them for food
 but i said no lord for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth
 but the voice coming a second time from heaven said what god has made clean do not you make common
 and this was done three times and they were all taken up again into heaven
 and at that minute three men sent from caesarea came to the house where we were
