 then when the sun came up god sent a burning east wind and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that jonah was overcome and requesting death for himself said death is better for me than life
 and the lord said to jonah have you any right to be angry about the vine and he said i have a right to be truly angry
 and the lord said you had pity on the vine for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible which came up in a night and came to an end in a night
 and am i not to have mercy on nineveh that great town in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left as well as much cattle
 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord the word of the lord came to joshua the son of nun moses helper saying
 moses my servant is dead so now get up  go over jordan you and all this people into the land which i am giving to them to the children of israel
 every place on which you put your foot i have given to you as i said to moses
 from the waste land and this mountain lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates and all the land of the hittites to the great sea in the west will be your country
 while you are living all will give way before you as i was with moses so i will be with you i will not take away my help from you or give you up
 take heart and be strong for you will give to this people for their heritage the land which i gave by an oath to their fathers
 only take heart and be very strong take care to do all the law which moses my servant gave you not turning from it to the right hand or to the left so that you may do well in all your undertakings
 let this book of the law be ever on your lips and in your thoughts day and night so that you may keep with care everything in it then a blessing will be on all your way and you will do well
 have i not given you your orders take heart and be strong have no fear and do not be troubled for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
 then joshua gave their orders to those who were in authority over the people saying
 go through the tents and give orders to the people saying get ready a store of food for in three days you are to go over this river jordan and take for your heritage the land which the lord your god is giving you
 and to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh joshua said
 keep in mind what moses the servant of the lord said to you the lord your god is sending you rest and will give you this land
 your wives your little ones and your cattle will be kept here in the land which moses gave you on this side of jordan but you the fighting men are to go over before your brothers armed to give them help
 till the lord has given your brothers rest as he has given it to you and they have taken their heritage in the land which the lord your god is giving them then you will go back to the land of your heritage which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the east side of jordan
 then they said to joshua in answer whatever you say to us we will do and wherever you send us we will go
 as we gave attention to moses in all things so we will give attention to you and may the lord your god be with you as he was with moses
 whoever goes against your orders and does not give attention to all your words will be put to death only take heart and be strong
 now when it came to the ears of adoni zedek king of jerusalem that joshua had taken ai and had given it up to the curse  for as he had done to jericho and its king so he had done to ai and its king  and that the people of gibeon had made peace with israel and were living among them
 he was in great fear because gibeon was a great town like one of the kings towns greater than ai and all the men in it were men of war
 so adoni zedek king of jerusalem sent to hoham king of hebron and to piram king of jarmuth and to japhia king of lachish and to debir king of eglon saying
 come up to me and give me help and let us make an attack on gibeon for they have made peace with joshua and the children of israel
 so the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon were banded together and went up with all their armies and took up their position before gibeon and made war against it
 and the men of gibeon sent to joshua to the tent circle at gilgal saying be not slow to send help to your servants come up quickly to our support and keep us safe for all the kings of the amorites from the hill country have come together against us
 so joshua went up from gilgal with all his army and all his men of war
 and the lord said to joshua have no fear of them for i have given them into your hands they will all give way before you
