 when the most high gave the nations their heritage separating into groups the children of men he had the limits of the peoples marked out keeping in mind the number of the children of israel
 for the lords wealth is his people jacob is the land of his heritage
 he came to him in the waste land in the unpeopled waste of sand putting his arms round him and caring for him he kept him as the light of his eye
 as an eagle teaching her young to make their flight with her wings outstretched over them takes them up on her strong feathers
 so the lord only was his guide no other god was with him
 he put him on the high places of the earth his food was the increase of the field honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock
 butter from his cows and milk from his sheep with fat of lambs and sheep of bashan and goats and the heart of the grain and for your drink wine from the blood of the grape
 but jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled you have become fat you are thick and full of food then he was untrue to the god who made him giving no honour to the rock of his salvation
 the honour which was his they gave to strange gods by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath
 they made offerings to evil spirits which were not god to gods who were strange to them which had newly come up not feared by your fathers
 you have no thought for the rock your father you have no memory of the god who gave you birth
 and the lord saw with disgust the evil doing of his sons and daughters
 and he said my face will be veiled from them i will see what their end will be for they are an uncontrolled generation children in whom is no faith
 they have given my honour to that which is not god moving me to wrath with their false worship i will give their honour to those who are not a people moving them to wrath by a foolish nation
 for my wrath is a flaming fire burning to the deep parts of the underworld burning up the earth with her increase and firing the deep roots of the mountains
 i will send a rain of troubles on them my arrows will be showered on them
 they will be wasted from need of food and overcome by burning heat and bitter destruction and the teeth of beasts i will send on them with the poison of the worms of the dust
 outside they will be cut off by the sword and in the inner rooms by fear death will take the young man and the virgin the baby at the breast and the grey haired man
 i said i would send them wandering far away i would make all memory of them go from the minds of men
 but for the fear that their haters uplifted in their pride might say our hand is strong the lord has not done all this
 for they are a nation without wisdom there is no sense in them
 if only they were wise if only this was clear to them and they would give thought to their future 
 how would it be possible for one to overcome a thousand and two to send ten thousand in flight if their rock had not let them go if the lord had not given them up
 for their rock is not like our rock even our haters themselves being judges
 for their vine is the vine of sodom from the fields of gomorrah their grapes are the grapes of evil and the berries are bitter
 their wine is the poison of dragons the cruel poison of snakes
 is not this among my secrets kept safe in my store house
 punishment is mine and reward at the time of the slipping of their feet for the day of their downfall is near sudden will be their fate
 for the lord will be judge of his people he will have pity for his servants when he sees that their power is gone there is no one shut up or free
 and he will say where are their gods the rock in which they put their faith
