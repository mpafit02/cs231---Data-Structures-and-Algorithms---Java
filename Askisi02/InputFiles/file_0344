 but he would not saying i have no desire for food but his servants together with the woman made him take food and he gave way to them so he got up from the earth and took his seat on the bed
 and the woman had in the house a young cow made fat for food and she put it to death straight away and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread
 and she put it before saul and his servants and they had a meal then they got up and went away the same night
 now the philistines got all their army together at aphek and the israelites put their forces in position by the fountain in jezreel
 and the lords of the philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands and david and his men came after with achish
 then the rulers of the philistines said what are these hebrews doing here and achish said to the rulers of the philistines is this not david the servant of saul the king of israel who has been with me for a year or two and i have never seen any wrong in him from the time when he came to me till now
 but the rulers of the philistines were angry with him and said to him make the man go back to the place you have given him do not let him go down with us to the fight or he may be turned against us and be false to us for how will this man make peace with his lord will it not be with the heads of these men
 is this not david who was named in their songs when in the dance they said to one another saul has put to death thousands and david tens of thousands
 then achish sent for david and said to him by the living lord you are upright and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me i have seen no evil in you from the day when you came to me till now but still the lords are not pleased with you
 so now go back and go in peace so that you do not make the lords of the philistines angry
 and david said to achish but what have i done what have you seen in your servant while i have been with you till this day that i may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king
 and achish in answer said it is true that in my eyes you are good like an angel of god but still the rulers of the philistines have said he is not to go up with us to the fight
 so get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who are with you and go to the place i have given you and have no evil design in your heart for you are good in my eyes but when there is light enough in the morning go away
 so david and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel
 now the young samuel was the servant of the lord before eli in those days the lord kept his word secret from men there was no open vision
 and at that time when eli was resting in his place  now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see 
 and the light of god was still burning while samuel was sleeping in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was
 the voice of the lord said samuels name and he said here am i
 and running to eli he said here am i for you said my name and eli said i did not say your name go to your rest again so he went back to his bed
 and again the lord said samuel and samuel got up and went to eli and said here am i for you certainly said my name but he said in answer i said nothing my son go to your rest again
 now at that time samuel had no knowledge of the lord and the revelation of the word of the lord had not come to him
 and for the third time the lord said samuels name and he got up and went to eli and said here am i for you certainly said my name then it was clear to eli that the voice which had said the childs name was the lords
 so eli said to samuel go back and if the voice comes again let your answer be say on lord for the ears of your servant are open so samuel went back to his bed
 then the lord came and said as before samuel samuel then samuel made answer say on lord for the ears of your servant are open
 and the lord said to samuel see i will do a thing in israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning
 in that day i will do to eli everything which i have said about his family from first to last
 and you are to say to him that i will send punishment on his family for ever for the sin which he had knowledge of because his sons have been cursing god and he had no control over them
 so i have made an oath to the family of eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family
 and samuel kept where he was not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of god in the morning and fear kept him from giving eli an account of his vision
 then eli said samuel my son and samuel answering said here am i
