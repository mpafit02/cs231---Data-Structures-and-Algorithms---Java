 why let yourself my son go out of the way with a strange woman and take another woman in your arms
 for a mans ways are before the eyes of the lord and he puts all his goings in the scales
 the evil doer will be taken in the net of his crimes and prisoned in the cords of his sin
 he will come to his end for need of teaching he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way
 my son if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour or given your word for another
 you are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth the sayings of your lips have overcome you
 do this my son and make yourself free because you have come into the power of your neighbour go without waiting and make a strong request to your neighbour
 give no sleep to your eyes or rest to them
 make yourself free like the roe from the hand of the archer and the bird from him who puts a net for her
 go to the ant you hater of work give thought to her ways and be wise
 having no chief overseer or ruler
 she gets her meat in the summer storing up food at the time of the grain cutting
 how long will you be sleeping o hater of work when will you get up from your sleep
 a little sleep a little rest a little folding of the hands in sleep
 then loss will come on you like an outlaw and your need like an armed man
 a good for nothing man is an evil doer he goes on his way causing trouble with false words
 making signs with his eyes rubbing with his feet and giving news with his fingers
 his mind is ever designing evil he lets loose violent acts
 for this cause his downfall will be sudden quickly he will be broken and there will be no help for him
 six things are hated by the lord seven things are disgusting to him
 eyes of pride a false tongue hands which take life without cause
 a heart full of evil designs feet which are quick in running after sin
 a false witness breathing out untrue words and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers
 my son keep the rule of your father and have in memory the teaching of your mother
 keep them ever folded in your heart and have them hanging round your neck
 in your walking it will be your guide when you are sleeping it will keep watch over you when you are awake it will have talk with you
 for the rule is a light and the teaching a shining light and the guiding words of training are the way of life
 they will keep you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the strange woman
 let not your hearts desire go after her fair body let not her eyes take you prisoner
 for a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread but another mans wife goes after ones very life
