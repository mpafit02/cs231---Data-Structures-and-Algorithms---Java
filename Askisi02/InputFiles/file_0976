 &lta psalm of david&gt the earth is the lords with all its wealth the world and all the people living in it
 for by him it was based on the seas and made strong on the deep rivers
 who may go up into the hill of the lord and who may come into his holy place
 he who has clean hands and a true heart whose desire has not gone out to foolish things who has not taken a false oath
 he will have blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation
 this is the generation of those whose hearts are turned to you even to your face o god of jacob  selah 
 let your heads be lifted up o doors be lifted up o you eternal doors that the king of glory may come in
 who is the king of glory the lord of strength and power the lord strong in war
 let your heads be lifted up o doors let them be lifted up o you eternal doors that the king of glory may come in
 who is the king of glory the lord of armies he is the king of glory  selah 
 &ltof david&gt to you o lord my soul is lifted up
 o my god i have put my faith in you let me not be shamed let not my haters be glorying over me
 let no servant of yours be put to shame may those be shamed who are false without cause
 make your steps clear to me o lord give me knowledge of your ways
 be my guide and teacher in the true way for you are the god of my salvation i am waiting for your word all the day
 o lord keep in mind your pity and your mercies for they have been from the earliest times
 do not keep in mind my sins when i was young or my wrongdoing let your memory of me be full of mercy o lord because of your righteousness
 good and upright is the lord so he will be the teacher of sinners in the way
 he will be an upright guide to the poor in spirit he will make his way clear to them
 all the ways of the lord are mercy and good faith for those who keep his agreement and his witness
 because of your name o lord let me have forgiveness for my sin which is very great
 if a man has the fear of the lord the lord will be his teacher in the way of his pleasure
 his soul will be full of good things and his seed will have the earth for its heritage
 the secret of the lord is with those in whose hearts is the fear of him he will make his agreement clear to them
 my eyes are turned to the lord at all times for he will take my feet out of the net
 be turned to me and have mercy on me for i am troubled and have no helper
 the troubles of my heart are increased o take me out of my sorrows
 give thought to my grief and my pain and take away all my sins
 see how those who are against me are increased for bitter is their hate of me
 o keep my soul and take me out of danger let me not be shamed for i have put my faith in you
