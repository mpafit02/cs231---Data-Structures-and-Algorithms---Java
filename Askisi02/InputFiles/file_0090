 for all the law is made complete in one word even in this have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 but if you are given to fighting with one another take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another
 but i say go on in the spirit and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh
 for the flesh has desires against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh because these are opposite the one to the other so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do
 but if you are guided by the spirit you are not under the law
 now the works of the flesh are clear which are these evil desire unclean things wrong use of the senses
 worship of images use of strange powers hates fighting desire for what another has angry feelings attempts to get the better of others divisions false teachings
 envy uncontrolled drinking and feasting and such things of which i give you word clearly even as i did in the past that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of god
 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace a quiet mind kind acts well doing faith
 gentle behaviour control over desires against such there is no law
 and those who are christs have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires
 if we are living by the spirit by the spirit let us be guided
 let us not be full of self glory making one another angry having envy of one another
 brothers if a man is taken in any wrongdoing you who are of the spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love keeping watch on yourself for fear that you yourself may be tested
 take on yourselves one anothers troubles and so keep the law of christ
 for if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing he is tricked by himself
 but let every man make test of his work and then will his cause for glory be in himself only and not in his neighbour
 because every man is responsible for his part of the work
 but let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher
 be not tricked god is not made sport of for whatever seed a man puts in that will he get back as grain
 because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death but he who puts in the seed of the spirit will of the spirit get the reward of eternal life
 and let us not get tired of well doing for at the right time we will get in the grain if we do not give way to weariness
 so then as we have the chance let us do good to all men and specially to those who are of the family of the faith
 see the size of the handwriting which i myself have made use of in writing to you
 those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh put force on you to undergo circumcision only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of christ
 because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law but they would have you undergo circumcision so that they may have glory in your flesh
 but far be it from me to have glory in anything but only in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me and i for it
 for having circumcision is nothing and not having circumcision is nothing but only a new order of existence
 and on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy and on the israel of god
 from this time on let no man be a trouble to me because my body is marked with the marks of jesus
