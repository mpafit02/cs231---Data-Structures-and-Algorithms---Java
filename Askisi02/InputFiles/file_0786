 and the lord said to joshua today the shame of egypt has been rolled away from you so that place was named gilgal to this day
 so the children of israel put up their tents in gilgal and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening in the lowlands of jericho
 and on the day after the passover they had for their food the produce of the land unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day
 and there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land the children of israel had manna no longer but that year the produce of the land of canaan was their food
 now when joshua was near jericho lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him with his sword uncovered in his hand and joshua went up to him and said are you for us or against us
 and he said no but i have come as captain of the armies of the lord then joshua falling down with his face to the earth in worship said what has my lord to say to his servant
 and the captain of the lords army said to joshua take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy and joshua did so
  now jericho was all shut up because of the children of israel there was no going out or coming in 
 and the lord said to joshua see i have given into your hands jericho with its king and all its men of war
 now let all your fighting men make a circle round the town going all round it once do this for six days
 and let seven priests go before the ark with seven loud sounding horns in their hands on the seventh day you are to go round the town seven times the priests blowing their horns
 and at the sound of a long note on the horns let all the people give a loud cry and the wall of the town will come down flat and all the people are to go straight forward
 then joshua the son of nun sent for the priests and said to them take up the ark of the agreement and let seven priests take seven horns in their hands and go before the ark of the lord
 and he said to the people go forward circling the town and let the armed men go before the ark of the lord
 so after joshua had said this to the people the seven priests with their seven horns went forward before the lord blowing on their horns and the ark of the lords agreement went after them
 and the armed men went before the priests who were blowing the horns and the mass of the people went after the ark blowing their horns
 and to the people joshua gave an order saying you will give no cry and make no sound and let no word go out of your mouth till the day when i say give a loud cry then give a loud cry
 so he made the ark of the lord go all round the town once then they went back to the tents for the night
 and early in the morning joshua got up and the priests took up the ark of the lord
 and the seven priests with their seven horns went on before the ark of the lord blowing their horns the armed men went before them and the mass of the people went after the ark of the lord blowing their horns
 the second day they went all round the town once and then went back to their tents and so they did for six days
 then on the seventh day they got up early at the dawn of the day and went round the town in the same way but that day they went round it seven times
 and the seventh time at the sound of the priests horns joshua said to the people now give a loud cry for the lord has given you the town
 and the town will be put to the curse and everything in it will be given to the lord only rahab the loose woman and all who are in the house with her will be kept safe because she kept secret the men we sent
 and as for you keep yourselves from the cursed thing for fear that you may get a desire for it and take some of it for yourselves and so be the cause of a curse and great trouble on the tents of israel
 but all the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron are holy to the lord they are to come into the store house of the lord
 so the people gave a loud cry and the horns were sounded and on hearing the horns the people gave a loud cry and the wall came down flat so that the people went up into the town every man going straight before him and they took the town
 and they put everything in the town to the curse men and women young and old ox and sheep and ass they put to death without mercy
 then joshua said to the two men who had been sent to make a search through the land go into the house of the loose woman and get her out and all who are with her as you gave her your oath
 so the searchers went in and got out rahab and her father and mother and her brothers and all she had and they got out all her family and they took them outside the tents of israel
