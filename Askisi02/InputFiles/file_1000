 we see your going o god even the going of my god my king into the holy place
 the makers of songs go before the players of music come after among the young girls playing on brass instruments
 give praise to god in the great meeting even the lord you who come from the fountain of israel
 there is little benjamin ruling them the chiefs of judah and their army the rulers of zebulun and the rulers of naphtali
 o god send out your strength the strength o god with which you have done great things for us
 out of your temple in jerusalem
 say sharp words to the beast among the water plants the band of strong ones with the lords of the peoples put an end to the people whose delight is in war
 kings will give you offerings they will come out of egypt from pathros will come offerings of silver ethiopia will be stretching out her hands to god
 make songs to god you kingdoms of the earth o make songs of praise to the lord  selah 
 to him who goes or the clouds of heaven the heaven which was from earliest times he sends out his voice of power
 make clear that strength is gods he is lifted up over israel and his power is in the clouds
 o god you are to be feared in your holy place the god of israel gives strength and power to his people praise be to god
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim of david&gt be my saviour o god because the waters have come in even to my neck
 my feet are deep in the soft earth where there is no support i have come into deep waters the waves are flowing over me
 i am tired with my crying my throat is burning my eyes are wasted with waiting for my god
 those who have hate for me without cause are greater in number than the hairs of my head those who are against me falsely desiring my destruction are very strong i gave back what i had not taken away
 o god you see how foolish i am and my wrongdoing is clear to you
 let not those who have hope in you be put to shame because of me o lord god of armies let not those who are waiting for you be made low because of me o god of israel
 i have been wounded with sharp words because of you my face has been covered with shame
 i have become strange to my brothers and like a man from a far country to my mothers children
 i am on fire with passion for your house and the hard things which are said about you have come on me
 my bitter weeping and my going without food were turned to my shame
 when i put on the clothing of grief they said evil of me
 i am a cause of wonder to those in authority a song to those who are given to strong drink
 but as for me let my prayer be made to you o lord at a time when you are pleased o god give me an answer in your great mercy for your salvation is certain
 take me from the grip of the sticky earth so that i may not go down into it let me be lifted up from the deep waters
 let me not be covered by the flowing waters let not the deep waters go over my head and let me not be shut up in the underworld
 give an answer to my words o lord for your mercy is good be turned to me because of your great pity
 let not your face be covered from your servant for i am in trouble quickly give me an answer
 come near to my soul for its salvation be my saviour because of those who are against me
