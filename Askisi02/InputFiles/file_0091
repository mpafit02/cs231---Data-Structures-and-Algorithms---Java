 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers so be it
 in times past the word of god came to our fathers through the prophets in different parts and in different ways
 but now at the end of these days it has come to us through his son to whom he has given all things for a heritage and through whom he made the order of the generations
 who being the outshining of his glory the true image of his substance supporting all things by the word of his power having given himself as an offering making clean from sins took his seat at the right hand of god in heaven
 having become by so much better than the angels as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs
 to which of the angels did god say at any time you are my son this day i have given you being or i will be his father and he will be my son
 and again when he is sending his only son into the world he says let all the angels of god give him worship
 and of the angels he says who makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire
 but of the son he says your seat of power o god is for ever and ever and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness
 you have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil and so god your god has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you
 you lord at the first did put the earth on its base and the heavens are the works of your hands
 they will come to their end but you are for ever they will become old as a robe
 they will be rolled up like a cloth even like a robe and they will be changed but you are the same and your years will have no end
 but of which of the angels has he said at any time take your seat at my right hand till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 are they not all helping spirits who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation
 for the law being only a poor copy of the future good things and not the true image of those things is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean
 for if this had been possible would there not have been an end of those offerings because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins
 but year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings
 because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins
 so that when he comes into the world he says you had no desire for offerings but you made a body ready for me
 you had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin
 then i said see i have come to do your pleasure o god  as it is said of me in the roll of the book 
 after saying you had no desire for offerings for burned offerings or offerings for sin  which are made by the law  and you had no pleasure in them
 then he said see i have come to do your pleasure he took away the old order so that he might put the new order in its place
 by that pleasure we have been made holy by the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for ever
 and every priest takes his place at the altar day by day doing what is necessary and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins
 but when jesus had made one offering for sins for ever he took his place at the right hand of god
 and has been waiting there from that time till all who are against him are made a foot rest for his feet
 because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy
 and the holy spirit is a witness for us for after he had said
