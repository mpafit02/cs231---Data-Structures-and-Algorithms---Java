 but for all this you had no faith in the lord your god
 who goes before you on your way looking for a place where you may put up your tents in fire by night lighting up the way you are to go and in a cloud by day
 and the lord hearing your words was angry and said with an oath
 truly not one of this evil generation will see that good land which i said i would give to your fathers
 but only caleb the son of jephunneh he will see it and to him and to his children i will give the land over which his feet have gone because he has been true to the lord with all his heart
 and in addition the lord was angry with me because of you saying you yourself will not go into it
 joshua the son of nun your servant he will go into the land say to him that he is to be strong for he will be israels guide into their heritage
 and your little ones who you said would come into strange hands your children who now have no knowledge of good or evil they will go into that land and to them i will give it and it will be theirs
 but as for you go back journeying into the waste land by the way of the red sea
 then you said to me we have done evil against the lord we will go up to the attack as the lord our god has given us orders and arming yourselves every one you made ready to go up without care into the hill country
 and the lord said to me say to them do not go up to the attack for i am not among you and you will be overcome by those who are against you
 this i said to you but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the lord and in your pride went up into the hill country
 and the amorites who were in the hill country came out against you and put you to flight rushing after you like bees and overcame you in seir driving you even as far as hormah
 and you came back weeping before the lord but the lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you
 so you were kept waiting in kadesh for a long time
 at that time the lord said to me make two other stones cut like the first two and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood
 and i will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you and you are to put them into the ark
 so i made an ark of hard wood and had two stones cut like the others and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands
 and he put on the stones as in the first writing the ten rules which the lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting and the lord gave the stones to me
 and turning round i came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which i had made and there they are as the lord gave me orders
  and the children of israel went on from beeroth bene jaakan to moserah there death came to aaron and he was put to rest in the earth and eleazar his son took his place as priest
 from there they went on to gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbathah a land of streams of water
 at that time the lord had the tribe of levi marked out to take up the ark of the lords agreement to be before the lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name to this day
 for this reason levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers the lord is his heritage as the lord your god said to him 
 and i was in the mountain as at the first time for forty days and forty nights and again the ears of the lord were open to my prayer and he did not send destruction on you
 then the lord said to me get up and go on your journey before the people so that they may go in and take the land which i said in my oath to their fathers that i would give them
 and now israel what would the lord your god have you do but to go in the fear of the lord your god walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul
 doing the orders of the lord and keeping his laws which i give you this day for your good
 the lord your god is ruler of heaven of the heaven of heavens and of the earth with everything in it
 but the lord had delight in your fathers and love for them marking out for himself their seed after them even you from all peoples as at this day
