 and joseph said it is as i said you have come with some secret purpose
 but in this way will you be put to the test by the life of pharaoh you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here
 send one of your number to get your brother and the rest of you will be kept in prison so that your words may be tested to see if you are true if not by the life of pharaoh your purpose is certainly secret
 so he put them in prison for three days
 and on the third day joseph said to them do this if you would keep your lives for i am a god fearing man
 if you are true men let one of you be kept in prison while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
 and come back to me with your youngest brother so that your words may be seen to be true and you will not be put to death this is what you are to do
 and they said to one another truly we did wrong to our brother for we saw his grief of mind and we did not give ear to his prayers that is why this trouble has come on us
 and reuben said to them did i not say to you do the child no wrong but you gave no attention so now punishment has come on us for his blood
 they were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to joseph for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language
 and turning away from them he was overcome with weeping then he went on talking to them again and took simeon and put chains on him before their eyes
 then joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain and for every mans money to be put back into his bag and for food to be given them for the journey which was done
 then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away
 now at their nights resting place one of them opening his bag to give his ass some food saw his money in the mouth of the bag
 and he said to his brothers my money has been given back it is in my bag then their hearts became full of fear and turning to one another they said what is this which god has done to us
 so when they came to jacob their father in the land of canaan they gave him an account of all their experiences saying
 the man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose
 and we said to him we are true men we have no evil designs
 we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is dead and the youngest is now with our father in the land of canaan
 and the ruler of the land said in this way i may be certain that you are true men let one of you be kept here with me while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
 and come back to me with your youngest brother then i will be certain that you are true men and i will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land
 and when they took the grain out of their bags it was seen that every mans parcel of money was in his bag and when they and their father saw the money they were full of fear
 and jacob their father said to them you have taken my children from me joseph is gone and simeon is gone and now you would take benjamin away all these things have come on me
 and reuben said put my two sons to death if i do not come back to you with him let him be in my care and i will give him safely back to you
 and he said i will not let my son go down with you for his brother is dead and he is all i have if evil overtakes him on the journey then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow
 now the land was in bitter need of food
 and when the grain which they had got in egypt was all used up their father said to them go again and get us a little food
 and judah said to him the man said to us with an oath you are not to come before me again without your brother
 if you will let our brother go with us we will go down and get food
 but if you will not send him we will not go down for the man said to us you are not to come before me if your brother is not with you
