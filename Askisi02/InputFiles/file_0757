 how much more those living in houses of earth whose bases are in the dust  they are crushed more quickly than an insect
 between morning and evening they are completely broken they come to an end for ever and no one takes note
 if their tent cord is pulled up do they not come to an end and without wisdom
 
 will he who is protesting give teaching to the ruler of all let him who has arguments to put forward against god give an answer
 and job said in answer to the lord
 truly i am of no value what answer may i give to you i will put my hand on my mouth
 i have said once and even twice what was in my mind but i will not do so again
 then the lord made answer to job out of the storm wind and said
 get your strength together like a man of war i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 will you even make my right of no value will you say that i am wrong in order to make clear that you are right
 have you an arm like god have you a voice of thunder like his
 put on the ornaments of your pride be clothed with glory and power
 let your wrath be overflowing let your eyes see all the sons of pride and make them low
 send destruction on all who are lifted up pulling down the sinners from their places
 let them be covered together in the dust let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld
 then i will give praise to you saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation
 see now the great beast whom i made even as i made you he takes grass for food like the ox
 his strength is in his body and his force in the muscles of his stomach
 his tail is curving like a cedar the muscles of his legs are joined together
 his bones are pipes of brass his legs are like rods of iron
 he is the chief of the ways of god made by him for his pleasure
 he takes the produce of the mountains where all the beasts of the field are at play
 he takes his rest under the trees of the river and in the pool under the shade of the water plants
 he is covered by the branches of the trees the grasses of the stream are round him
 truly if the river is overflowing it gives him no cause for fear he has no sense of danger even if jordan is rushing against his mouth
 will anyone take him when he is on the watch or put metal teeth through his nose
 is it possible for leviathan to be pulled out with a fish hook or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth
 will you put a cord into his nose or take him away with a cord round his tongue
 will he make prayers to you or say soft words to you
