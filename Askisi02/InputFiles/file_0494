 and on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread two omers for every person and all the rulers of the people gave moses word of it
 and he said this is what the lord has said tomorrow is a day of rest a holy sabbath to the lord what has to be cooked may be cooked and what is over put on one side to be kept till the morning
 and they kept it till the morning as moses had said and no smell came from it and it had no worms
 and moses said make your meal today of what you have for this day is a sabbath to the lord today you will not get any in the fields
 for six days you will get it but on the seventh day the sabbath there will not be any
 but still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it and there was not any
 and the lord said to moses how long will you go against my orders and my laws
 see because the lord has given you the sabbath he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days let every man keep where he is let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
 so the people took their rest on the seventh day
 and this bread was named manna by israel it was white like a grain seed and its taste was like cakes made with honey
 and moses said this is the order which the lord has given let one omer of it be kept for future generations so that they may see the bread which i gave you for your food in the waste land when i took you out from the land of egypt
 and moses said to aaron take a pot and put one omer of manna in it and put it away before the lord to be kept for future generations
 so aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the children of israel had manna for their food for forty years till they came to a land with people in it till they came to the edge of the land of canaan
 now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
 and the children of israel went on from the waste land of sin by stages as the lord gave them orders and put up their tents in rephidim and there was no drinking water for the people
 so the people were angry with moses and said give us water for drinking and moses said why are you angry with me and why do you put god to the test
 and the people were in great need of water and they made an outcry against moses and said why have you taken us out of egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water
 and moses crying out to the lord said what am i to do to this people they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning
 and the lord said to moses go on before the people and take some of the chiefs of israel with you and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the nile and go
 see i will take my place before you on the rock in horeb and when you give the rock a blow water will come out of it and the people will have drink and moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of israel
 and he gave that place the name massah and meribah because the children of israel were angry and because they put the lord to the test saying is the lord with us or not
 then amalek came and made war on israel in rephidim
 and moses said to joshua get together a band of men for us and go out make war on amalek tomorrow i will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand
 so joshua did as moses said to him and went to war with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
 now while moses hand was lifted up israel was the stronger but when he let his hand go down amalek became the stronger
 but moses hands became tired so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it aaron and hur supporting his hands one on one side and one on the other so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down
 and joshua overcame amalek and his people with the sword
 and the lord said to moses make a record of this in a book so that it may be kept in memory and say it again in the ears of joshua that all memory of amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth
 then moses put up an altar and gave it the name of yahweh nissi
