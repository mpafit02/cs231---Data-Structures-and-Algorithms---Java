 and put him into the great deep and it was shut and locked over him so that he might put the nations in error no longer till the thousand years were ended after this he will be let loose for a little time
 and i saw high seats and they were seated on them and the right of judging was given to them and i saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and those who did not give worship to the beast or to his image and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands and they were living and ruling with christ a thousand years
 the rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended this is the first coming back from the dead
 happy and holy is he who has a part in this first coming over these the second death has no authority but they will be priests of god and of christ and will be ruling with him a thousand years
 and when the thousand years are ended satan will be let loose out of his prison
 and will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to get them together to the war the number of whom is like the sands of the sea
 and they went up over the face of the earth and made a circle about the tents of the saints and the well loved town and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction
 and the evil one who put them in error was sent down into the sea of ever burning fire where the beast and the false prophet are and their punishment will go on day and night for ever and ever
 and i saw a great white seat and him who was seated on it before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight and there was no place for them
 and i saw the dead great and small taking their places before the high seat and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged by the things which were in the books even by their works
 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man by his works
 and death and hell were put into the sea of fire this is the second death even the sea of fire
 and if anyones name was not in the book of life he went down into the sea of fire
 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were gone and there was no more sea
 and i saw the holy town new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god like a bride made beautiful for her husband
 and there came to my ears a great voice out of the high seat saying see the tent of god is with men and he will make his living place with them and they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god
 and he will put an end to all their weeping and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain for the first things have come to an end
 and he who is seated on the high seat said see i make all things new and he said put it in the book for these words are certain and true
 and he said to me it is done i am the first and the last the start and the end i will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need
 he who overcomes will have these things for his heritage and i will be his god and he will be my son
 but those who are full of fear and without faith the unclean and takers of life those who do the sins of the flesh and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images and all those who are false will have their part in the sea of ever burning fire which is the second death
 and one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments came and said to me come here and see the bride the lambs wife
 and he took me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and let me see the holy town jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god
 having the glory of god and her light was like a stone of great price a jasper stone clear as glass
 she had a wall great and high with twelve doors and at the doors twelve angels and names on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel
 and on the east were three doors and on the north three doors and on the south three doors and on the west three doors
 and the wall of the town had twelve bases and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
 and he who was talking with me had a gold measuring rod to take the measure of the town and of its doors and its wall
 and the town is square as wide as it is long and he took the measure of the town with the rod one thousand and five hundred miles it is equally long and wide and high
 and he took the measure of its wall one hundred and forty four cubits after the measure of a man that is of an angel
