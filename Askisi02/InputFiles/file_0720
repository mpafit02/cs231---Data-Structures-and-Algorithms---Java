 in those days and in that time says the lord the children of israel will come they and the children of judah together they will go on their way weeping and making prayer to the lord their god
 they will be questioning about the way to zion with their faces turned in its direction saying come and be united to the lord in an eternal agreement which will be kept in mind for ever
 my people have been wandering sheep their keepers have made them go out of the right way turning them loose on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill having no memory of their resting place
 they have been attacked by all those who came across them and their attackers said we are doing no wrong because they have done evil against the lord in whom is righteousness against the lord the hope of their fathers
 go in flight out of babylon go out of the land of the chaldaeans and be like he goats before the flocks
 for see i am moving and sending up against babylon a band of great nations from the north country and they will put their armies in position against her and from there she will be taken their arrows will be like those of an expert man of war not one will come back without getting its mark
 and the wealth of chaldaea will come into the hands of her attackers all those who take her wealth will have enough says the lord
 because you are glad because you are lifted up with pride you wasters of my heritage because you are playing like a young cow put out to grass and you make a noise like strong horses
 your mother will be put to shame she who gave you birth will be looked down on see she will be the last of the nations a waste place a dry and unwatered land
 because of the wrath of the lord no one will be living in it and it will be quite unpeopled everyone who goes by babylon will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of fear at all her punishments
 put your armies in position against babylon on every side all you bowmen let loose your arrows at her not keeping any back for she has done evil against the lord
 give a loud cry against her on every side she has given herself up her supports are overturned her walls are broken down for it is the payment taken by the lord give her payment as she has done so do to her
 let the planter of seed be cut off from babylon and everyone using the curved blade at the time of the grain cutting for fear of the cruel sword everyone will be turned to his people everyone will go in flight to his land
 israel is a wandering sheep the lions have been driving him away first he was attacked by the king of assyria and now his bones have been broken by nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 so this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send punishment on the king of babylon and on his land as i have given punishment to the king of assyria
 and i will make israel come back to his resting place and he will get his food on carmel and bashan and have his desire in full measure on the hills of ephraim and in gilead
 in those days and in that time says the lord when the evil doing of israel is looked for there will be nothing and in judah no sins will be seen for i will have forgiveness for those whom i will keep safe
 go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the people of pekod put them to death and send destruction after them says the lord and do everything i have given you orders to do
 there is a sound of war in the land and of great destruction
 how is the hammer of all the earth cut in two and broken  how has babylon become a waste among the nations 
 i have put a net for you and you have been taken o babylon without your knowledge you have been uncovered and taken because you were fighting against the lord
 from his store house the lord has taken the instruments of his wrath for the lord the lord of armies has a work to do in the land of the chaldaeans
 come up against her one and all let her store houses be broken open make her into a mass of stones give her to the curse till there is nothing of her to be seen
 put all her oxen to the sword let them go down to death sorrow is theirs for their day has come the time of their punishment
 the voice of those who are in flight who have got away safe from the land of babylon to give news in zion of punishment from the lord our god even payment for his temple
 send for the archers to come together against babylon all the bowmen put up your tents against her on every side let no one get away give her the reward of her work as she has done so do to her for she has been uplifted in pride against the lord against the holy one of israel
 for this cause her young men will be falling in her streets and all her men of war will be cut off in that day says the lord
 see i am against you o pride says the lord the lord of armies for your day has come the time when i will send punishment on you
 and pride will go with uncertain steps and have a fall and there will be no one to come to his help and i will put a fire in his towns burning up everything round about him
 this is what the lord of armies has said the children of israel and the children of judah are crushed down together all those who took them prisoner keep them in a tight grip they will not let them go
