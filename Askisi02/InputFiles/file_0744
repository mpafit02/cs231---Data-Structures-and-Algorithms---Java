 gold may not be given for it or a weight of silver in payment for it
 it may not be valued with the gold of ophir with the onyx of great price or the sapphire
 gold and glass are not equal to it in price and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold
 there is no need to say anything about coral or crystal and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls
 the topaz of ethiopia is not equal to it and it may not be valued with the best gold
 from where then does wisdom come and where is the resting place of knowledge
 for it is kept secret from the eyes of all living unseen by the birds of the air
 destruction and death say we have only had word of it with our ears
 god has knowledge of the way to it and of its resting place
 for his eyes go to the ends of the earth and he sees everything under heaven
 when he made a weight for the wind measuring out the waters
 when he made a law for the rain and a way for the thunder flames
 then he saw it and put it on record he gave it its fixed form searching it out completely
 and he said to man truly the fear of the lord is wisdom and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge
 and job again took up the word and said
 if only i might again be as i was in the months which are past in the days when god was watching over me 
 when his light was shining over my head and when i went through the dark by his light
 as i was in my flowering years when my tent was covered by the hand of god
 while the ruler of all was still with me and my children were round me
 when my steps were washed with milk and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me
 when i went out of my door to go up to the town and took my seat in the public place
 the young men saw me and went away and the old men got up from their seats
 the rulers kept quiet and put their hands on their mouths
 the chiefs kept back their words and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths
 for when it came to their ears men said that i was truly happy and when their eyes saw they gave witness to me
 for i was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help to the child with no father and to him who had no supporter
 the blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me and i put a song of joy into the widows heart
 i put on righteousness as my clothing and was full of it right decisions were to me a robe and a head dress
 i was eyes to the blind and feet to him who had no power of walking
 i was a father to the poor searching out the cause of him who was strange to me
