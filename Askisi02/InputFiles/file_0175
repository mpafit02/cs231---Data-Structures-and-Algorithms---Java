 and the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh
 let not that which has been joined together by god be parted by man
 and in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing
 and he said to them whoever puts away his wife and takes another is false to his wife
 and if she herself puts away her husband and takes another she is false to her husband
 and they took to him little children so that he might put his hands on them and the disciples said sharp words to them
 and when jesus saw it he was angry and said to them let the little children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of god
 truly i say to you whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of god like a little child will not come into it at all
 and he took them in his arms and gave them a blessing putting his hands on them
 and while he was going out into the way a man came running to him and went down on his knees saying good master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and jesus said to him why do you say i am good no one is good but one and that is god
 you have knowledge of what is said in the law do not put any one to death do not be untrue in married life do not take what is not yours do not give false witness do not get money by deceit give honour to your father and mother
 and he said to him master all these laws i have kept from the time when i was young
 and jesus looking on him and loving him said there is one thing needed go get money for your goods and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come with me
 but his face became sad at the saying and he went away sorrowing for he was one who had much property
 and jesus looking round about said to his disciples how hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of god 
 and the disciples were full of wonder at his words but jesus said to them again children how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of god 
 it is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of god
 and they were greatly surprised saying to him who then may have salvation
 jesus looking on them said with men it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god
 peter said to him see we have given up everything and come after you
 jesus said truly i say to you there is no man who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land because of me and the good news
 who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and land  though with great troubles and in the world to come eternal life
 but a great number who are first will be last and those who are last will be first
 and they were on the way going up to jerusalem and jesus was going before them and they were full of wonder but those who came after him were in fear and again he took the twelve and gave them word of the things which were to come on him
 saying see we go up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes and they will give an order for his death and will give him up to the gentiles
 and they will make sport of him and put shame on him and give him cruel blows and will put him to death and after three days he will come back from the dead
 and there came to him james and john the sons of zebedee saying to him master will you give us whatever may be our request
 and he said to them what would you have me do for you
 and they said to him let us be seated one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
