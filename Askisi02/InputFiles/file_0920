 whose ways are not straight and whose footsteps are turned to evil
 to take you out of the power of the strange woman who says smooth words with her tongue
 who is false to the husband of her early years and does not keep the agreement of her god in mind
 for her house is on the way down to death her footsteps go down to the shades
 those who go to her do not come back again their feet do not keep in the ways of life
 so that you may go in the way of good men and keep in the footsteps of the upright
 for the upright will be living in the land and the good will have it for their heritage
 but sinners will be cut off from the land and those whose acts are false will be uprooted
 wine makes men foolish and strong drink makes men come to blows and whoever comes into error through these is not wise
 the wrath of a king is like the loud cry of a lion he who makes him angry does wrong against himself
 it is an honour for a man to keep from fighting but the foolish are ever at war
 the hater of work will not do his ploughing because of the winter so at the time of grain cutting he will be requesting food and will get nothing
 the purpose in the heart of a man is like deep water but a man of good sense will get it out
 most men make no secret of their kind acts but where is a man of good faith to be seen
 an upright man goes on in his righteousness happy are his children after him 
 a king on the seat of judging puts to flight all evil with his eyes
 who is able to say i have made my heart clean i am free from my sin
 unequal weights and unequal measures they are all disgusting to the lord
 even a child may be judged by his doings if his work is free from sin and if it is right
 the hearing ear and the seeing eye are equally the lords work
 do not be a lover of sleep or you will become poor keep your eyes open and you will have bread enough
 a poor thing a poor thing says he who is giving money for goods but when he has gone on his way then he makes clear his pride in what he has got
 there is gold and a store of corals but the lips of knowledge are a jewel of great price
 take a mans clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men
 bread of deceit is sweet to a man but after his mouth will be full of sand
 every purpose is put into effect by wise help and by wise guiding make war
 he who goes about talking of the business of others gives away secrets so have nothing to do with him whose lips are open wide
 if anyone puts a curse on his father or his mother his light will be put out in the blackest night
 a heritage may be got quickly at first but the end of it will not be a blessing
 do not say i will give punishment for evil go on waiting for the lord and he will be your saviour
