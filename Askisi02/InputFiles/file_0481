 have joy with the woman of your love all the days of your foolish life which he gives you under the sun because that is your part in life and in your work which you do under the sun
 whatever comes to your hand to do with all your power do it because there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in the place of the dead to which you are going
 and again i saw under the sun that the reward goes not to him who is quick or the fruits of war to the strong and there is no bread for the wise or wealth for men of learning or respect for those who have knowledge but time and chance come to all
 even man has no knowledge of his time like fishes taken in an evil net or like birds taken by deceit are the sons of men taken in an evil time when it comes suddenly on them
 this again i have seen under the sun as wisdom and it seemed great to me
 there was a little town and the number of its men was small and there came a great king against it and made an attack on it building works of war round about it
 now there was in the town a poor wise man and he by his wisdom kept the town safe but no one had any memory of that same poor man
 then i said wisdom is better than strength but the poor mans wisdom is not respected and his words are not given a hearing
 the words of the wise which come quietly to the ear are noted more than the cry of a ruler among the foolish
 wisdom is better than instruments of war but one sinner is the destruction of much good
 now it came about in the days of ahasuerus  that ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty seven divisions of the kingdom from india as far as ethiopia 
 that in those days when king ahasuerus was ruling in shushan his strong town
 in the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants and the captains of the army of persia and media the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom were present before him
 and for a long time even a hundred and eighty days he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honour which were his
 and at the end of that time the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in shushan the kings town small as well as great for seven days in the outer square of the garden of the kings house
 there were fair hangings of white and green and blue fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone the seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone
 and they gave them drink in gold vessels every vessel being different and wine of the kingdom freely given by the king
 and the drinking was in keeping with the law no one was forced for the king had given orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man
 and vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of king ahasuerus
 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was glad with wine he gave orders to mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven unsexed servants who were waiting before ahasuerus the king
 that vashti the queen was to come before him crowned with her crown and let the people and the captains see her for she was very beautiful
 but when the servants gave her the kings order vashti the queen said she would not come then the king was very angry and his heart was burning with wrath
 and the king said to the wise men who had knowledge of the times  for this was the kings way with all who were expert in law and in the giving of decisions
 and second only to him were carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven rulers of persia and media who were friends of the king and had the first places in the kingdom 
 what is to be done by law to vashti the queen because she has not done what king ahasuerus by his servants gave her orders to do
 and before the king and the captains memucan gave his answer vashti the queen has done wrong not only to the king but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of king ahasuerus
 for news of what the queen has done will come to the ears of all women and they will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them king ahasuerus gave orders for vashti the queen to come before him and she came not
 and the wives of the captains of persia and media hearing what the queen has done will say the same to all the kings captains so there will be much shame and wrath
 if it is pleasing to the king let an order go out from him and let it be recorded among the laws of the persians and the medes so that it may never be changed that vashti is never again to come before king ahasuerus and let the king give her place to another who is better than she
 and when this order given by the king is made public through all his kingdom  for it is great  all the wives will give honour to their husbands great as well as small
