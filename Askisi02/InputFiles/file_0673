 for the lord has made you come back to him like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit for one may not give up the wife of ones early days
 for a short time i gave you up but with great mercies i will take you back again
 in overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute but i will have pity on you for ever says the lord who takes up your cause
 for this is like the days of noah to me for as i took an oath that the waters of noah would never again go over the earth so have i taken an oath that i will not again be angry with you or say bitter words to you
 for the mountains may be taken away and the hills be moved out of their places but my love will not be taken from you or my agreement of peace broken says the lord who has had mercy on you
 o troubled one storm crushed uncomforted  see your stones will be framed in fair colours and your bases will be sapphires
 i will make your towers of rubies and your doors of carbuncles and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones
 and all your builders will be made wise by the lord and great will be the peace of your children
 all your rights will be made certain to you have no fear of evil and destruction will not come near you
 see they may be moved to war but not by my authority all those who come together to make an attack on you will be broken against you
 see i have made the iron worker blowing on the burning coals and making the instrument of war by his work and i have made the waster for destruction
 no instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness comes from me says the lord
 ho  everyone in need come to the waters and he who has no strength let him get food come get bread without money wine and milk without price
 why do you give your money for what is not bread and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure give ear to me so that your food may be good and you may have the best in full measure
 give ear and come to me take note with care so that your souls may have life and i will make an eternal agreement with you even the certain mercies of david
 see i have given him as a witness to the peoples a ruler and a guide to the nations
 see you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you because of the lord your god and because of the holy one of israel for he has given you glory
 make search for the lord while he is there make prayer to him while he is near
 let the sinner give up his way and the evil doer his purpose and let him come back to the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for there is full forgiveness with him
 for my thoughts are not your thoughts or your ways my ways says the lord
 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
 for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and does not go back again but gives water to the earth and makes it fertile giving seed to the planter and bread for food
 so will my word be which goes out of my mouth it will not come back to me with nothing done but it will give effect to my purpose and do that for which i have sent it
 for you will go out with joy and be guided in peace the mountains and the hills will make melody before you and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy
 in place of the thorn will come up the fir tree and in place of the blackberry the myrtle and it will be to the lord for a name for an eternal sign which will not be cut off
 the lord says let your way of life be upright and let your behaviour be rightly ordered for my salvation is near and my righteousness will quickly be seen
 happy is the man who does this and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered who keeps the sabbath holy and his hand from doing any evil
 and let not the man from a strange country who has been joined to the lord say the lord will certainly put a division between me and his people and let not the unsexed man say see i am a dry tree
 for the lord says as for the unsexed who keep my sabbaths and give their hearts to pleasing me and keep their agreement with me
 i will give to them in my house and inside my walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters i will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off
