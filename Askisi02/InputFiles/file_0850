 but like water overflowing he will take them away he will put an end to those who come up against him driving his haters into the dark
 what are you designing against the lord he will put an end to it his haters will not come up again a second time
 for though they are like twisted thorns and are overcome as with drink they will come to destruction like stems of grass fully dry
 one has gone out from you who is designing evil against the lord whose purposes are of no value
 this is what the lord has said the days of my cause against you are ended they are cut off and past though i have sent trouble on you you will no longer be troubled
 and now i will let his yoke be broken off you and your chains be parted
 the lord has given an order about you that no more of your name are to be planted from the house of your gods i will have the pictured and metal images cut off i will make your last resting place a place of shame for you are completely evil
 see on the mountains the feet of him who comes with good news giving word of peace  keep your feasts o judah give effect to your oaths for the good for nothing man will never again go through you he is completely cut off
 a crusher has come up before your face keep a good look out let the way be watched make yourself strong let your power be greatly increased
 for the lord will make good the vine of jacob as well as the vine of israel for the wasters have made them waste and sent destruction on the branches of their vine
 the body covers of his fighting men have been made red the men of war are clothed in bright red the war carriages are like flames of fire in the day when he gets ready the horses are shaking
 the war carriages are rushing through the streets pushing against one another in the wide ways looking like burning lights running like thunder flames
 he takes the record of his great men they go falling on their way they go quickly to the wall the cover is made ready
 the river doorways are forced open and the kings house is flowing away
 and the queen is uncovered she is taken away and her servant girls are weeping like the sound of doves hammering on their breasts
 but nineveh is like a pool of water whose waters are flowing away keep your place they say but no one is turning back
 take silver take gold for there is no end to the store take for yourselves a weight of things to be desired
 everything has been taken from her all is gone she has nothing more the heart is turned to water the knees are shaking all are twisted in pain and colour has gone from all faces
 where is the lions hole the place where the young lions got their food where the lion and the she lion were walking with their young without cause for fear
 food enough for his young and for his she lions was pulled down by the lion his hole was full of flesh and his resting place stored with meat
 see i am against you says the lord of armies and i will have your war carriages burned in the smoke and your young lions will be food for the sword you will no longer get your food by force on the earth and the voice of your she lions will be stopped for ever
 a curse is on the town of blood it is full of deceit and violent acts and there is no end to the taking of life
 the noise of the whip and the noise of thundering wheels horses rushing and war carriages jumping
 horsemen driving forward and the shining sword and the bright spear and a great number of wounded and masses of dead bodies they are falling over the bodies of the dead
 because of all the false ways of the loose woman expert in attraction and wise in secret arts who takes nations in the net of her false ways and families through her secret arts
 see i am against you says the lord of armies and i will have your skirts pulled over your face and let the nations see you unclothed and the kingdoms your shame
 i will make you completely disgusting and full of shame and will put you up to be looked at by all
 and it will come about that all who see you will go in flight from you and say nineveh is made waste who will be weeping for her where am i to get comforters for her
 are you better than no amon seated on the nile streams with waters all round her whose wall was the sea and her earthwork the waters
 ethiopia was her strength and egyptians without number put and lubim were her helpers
