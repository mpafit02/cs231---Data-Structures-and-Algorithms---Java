 and i was very sad because there was no one able to get the book open or to see what was in it
 and one of the rulers said to me do not be sad see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has overcome and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps
 and i saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts and in the middle of the rulers a lamb in his place which seemed as if it had been put to death having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth
 and he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat
 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the lamb having every one an instrument of music and gold vessels full of perfumes which are the prayers of the saints
 and their voices are sounding in a new song saying it is right for you to take the book and to make it open for you were put to death and have made an offering to god of your blood for men of every tribe and language and people and nation
 and have made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they are ruling on the earth
 and i saw and there came to my ears the sound of a great number of angels round about the high seat and the beasts and the rulers and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
 saying with a great voice it is right to give to the lamb who was put to death power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
 and to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and of all things which are in them saying to him who is seated on the high seat and to the lamb may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever
 and the four beasts said so be it and the rulers went down on their faces and gave worship
 and i saw when the lamb undid one of the stamps and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears saying as with a voice of thunder come and see
 and i saw a white horse and he who was seated on it had a bow and there was given to him a crown and he went out with power to overcome
 and when the second stamp was undone the voice of the second beast came to my ears saying come and see
 and another horse came out a red horse and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth so that people might put one another to death and there was given to him a great sword
 and when the third stamp was undone the voice of the third beast came to my ears saying come and see and i saw a black horse and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand
 and a voice came to my ears from the middle of the four beasts saying a measure of grain for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine
 and when the fourth stamp was undone the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears saying come and see
 and i saw a grey horse and the name of him who was seated on it was death and hell came after him and there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth to put to destruction by the sword and by taking away their food and by death and by the beasts of the earth
 and when the fifth stamp was undone i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of god and for the witness which they kept
 and they gave a great cry saying how long will it be o ruler holy and true before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth
 and there was given to every one a white robe and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time till the number was complete of the other servants their brothers who would be put to death even as they had been
 and i saw when the sixth stamp was undone and there was a great earth shock and the sun became black as haircloth and all the moon became as blood
 and the stars of heaven were falling to the earth like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind
 and the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places
 and the kings of the earth and the rulers and the chief captains and the men of wealth and the strong and every servant and free man took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains
 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks come down on us covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat and from the wrath of the lamb
 for the great day of their wrath is come and who may keep his place
 after this i saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth keeping back the four winds in their hands so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth or on the sea or on any tree
 and i saw another angel coming up from the east having the mark of the living god and he said with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea
