 then pharaoh went into his house and did not take even this to heart
 and all the egyptians made holes round about the nile to get drinking water for they were not able to make use of the nile water
 and seven days went past after the lord had put his hand on the nile
 and this is what the lord said to moses go to pharaoh and say to him the lord says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 and if you will not let them go see i will send frogs into every part of your land
 the nile will be full of frogs and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people and into your ovens and into your bread basins
 the frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants
 and the lord said to moses say to aaron let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools causing frogs to come up on the land of egypt
 and when aaron put out his hand over the waters of egypt the frogs came up and all the land of egypt was covered with them
 and the wonder workers did the same with their secret arts making frogs come up over the land of egypt
 then pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said make prayer to the lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people and i will let the people go and make their offering to the lord
 and moses said i will let you have the honour of saying when i am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses and be only in the nile
 and he said by tomorrow and he said let it be as you say so that you may see that there is no other like the lord our god
 and the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the nile
 then moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses made prayer to the lord about the frogs which he had sent on pharaoh
 and the lord did as moses said and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields
 and they put them together in masses and a bad smell went up from the land
 but when pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses say to aaron let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of egypt
 and they did so and aaron stretching out the rod in his hand gave a touch to the dust of the earth and insects came on man and on beast all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of egypt
 and the wonder workers with their secret arts attempting to make insects were unable to do so and there were insects on man and on beast
 then the wonder workers said to pharaoh this is the finger of god but pharaohs heart was hard and he did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and take your place before pharaoh when he comes out to the water and say to him this is what the lord says let my people go to give me worship
 for if you do not let my people go see i will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses and the houses of the egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies
 and at that time i will make a division between your land and the land of goshen where my people are and no flies will be there so that you may see that i am the lord over all the earth
 and i will put a division between my people and your people tomorrow this sign will be seen
 and the lord did so and great clouds of flies came into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and all the land of egypt was made waste because of the flies
 and pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said go and make your offering to your god here in the land
 and moses said it is not right to do so for we make our offerings of that to which the egyptians give worship and if we do so before their eyes certainly we will be stoned
 but we will go three days journey into the waste land and make an offering to the lord our god as he may give us orders
