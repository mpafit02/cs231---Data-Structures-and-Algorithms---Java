 all the men who were united with you have been false to you driving you out to the edge of the land the men who were at peace with you have overcome you they have taken their heritage in your place
 will i not in that day says the lord take away the wise men out of edom and wisdom out of the mountain of esau
 and your men of war o teman will be overcome with fear so that every one of them may be cut off from the mountain of esau
 because you were the cause of violent death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother jacob you will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever
 because you were there watching when men from other lands took away his goods and strange men came into his doors and put the fate of jerusalem to the decision of chance you were like one of them
 do not see with pleasure your brothers evil day the day of his fate and do not be glad over the children of judah on the day of their destruction or make wide your mouth on the day of trouble
 do not go into the doors of my people on the day of their downfall do not be looking on their trouble with pleasure on the day of their downfall or put your hands on their goods on the day of their downfall
 and do not take your place at the cross roads cutting off those of his people who get away and do not give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble
 for the day of the lord is coming quickly on all nations as you have done it will be done to you the reward of your acts will come on your head
 for as you have been drinking on my holy mountain so will all the nations go on drinking without end they will go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats and they will be as if they had never been
 but in mount zion some will be kept safe and it will be holy and the children of jacob will take their heritage
 and the children of jacob will be a fire and those of joseph a flame and the children of esau dry stems of grass burned up by them till all is gone and there will be no people living in esau for the lord has said it
 and they will take the south and the lowland and the country of ephraim and gilead as their heritage
 and those of the children of israel who were the first to be taken away as prisoners will have their heritage among the canaanites as far as zarephath and those who were taken away from jerusalem who are in sepharad will have the towns of the south
 and those who have been kept safe will come up from mount zion to be judges of the mountain of esau and the kingdom will be the lords
 the wise sayings of solomon the son of david king of israel
 to have knowledge of wise teaching to be clear about the words of reason
 to be trained in the ways of wisdom in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour
 to make the simple minded sharp and to give the young man knowledge and serious purpose
  the wise man hearing will get greater learning and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided 
 to get the sense of wise sayings and secrets and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings
 the fear of the lord is the start of knowledge but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching
 my son give ear to the training of your father and do not give up the teaching of your mother
 for they will be a crown of grace for your head and chain ornaments about your neck
 my son if sinners would take you out of the right way do not go with them
 if they say come with us let us make designs against the good waiting secretly for the upright without cause
 let us overcome them living like the underworld and in their strength as those who go down to death
 goods of great price will be ours our houses will be full of wealth
 take your chance with us and we will all have one money bag
 my son do not go with them keep your feet from their ways
