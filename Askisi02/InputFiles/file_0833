 and say to the children of israel as for any man cursing god his sin will be on his head
 and he who says evil against the name of the lord will certainly be put to death he will be stoned by all the people the man who is not of your nation and one who is an israelite by birth whoever says evil against the holy name is to be put to death
 and anyone who takes anothers life is certainly to be put to death
 and anyone wounding a beast and causing its death will have to make payment for it a life for a life
 and if a man does damage to his neighbour as he has done so let it be done to him
 wound for wound eye for eye tooth for tooth whatever damage he has done so let it be done to him
 he who puts a beast to death will have to make payment for it he who puts a man to death will himself be put to death
 you are to have the same law for a man of another nation living among you as for an israelite for i am the lord your god
 and moses said these words to the children of israel and they took the man who had been cursing outside the tent circle and had him stoned the children of israel did as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses on mount sinai
 say to the children of israel when you come into the land which i will give you let the land keep a sabbath to the lord
 for six years put seed into your land and for six years give care to your vines and get in the produce of them
 but let the seventh year be a sabbath of rest for the land a sabbath to the lord do not put seed into your land or have your vines cut
 that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes of your uncared for vines may not be taken off let it be a year of rest for the land
 and the sabbath of the land will give food for you and your man servant and your woman servant and those working for payment and for those of another country who are living among you
 and for your cattle and the beasts on the land all the natural increase of the land will be for food
 and let seven sabbaths of years be numbered to you seven times seven years even the days of seven sabbaths of years that is forty nine years
 then let the loud horn be sounded far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of taking away sin let the horn be sounded through all your land
 and let this fiftieth year be kept holy and say publicly that everyone in the land is free from debt it is the jubilee and every man may go back to his heritage and to his family
 let this fiftieth year be the jubilee no seed may be planted and that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes may not be taken from the uncared for vines
 for it is the jubilee and it is holy to you your food will be the natural increase of the field
 in this year of jubilee let every man go back to his heritage
 and in the business of trading goods for money do no wrong to one another
 let your exchange of goods with your neighbours have relation to the number of years after the year of jubilee and the number of times the earth has given her produce
 if the number of years is great the price will be increased and if the number of years is small the price will be less for it is the produce of a certain number of years which the man is giving you
 and do no wrong one to another but let the fear of your god be before you for i am the lord your god
 so keep my rules and my decisions and do them and you will be safe in your land
 and the land will give her fruit and you will have food in full measure and be safe in the land
 and if you say where will our food come from in the seventh year when we may not put in seed or get in the increase
 then i will send my blessing on you in the sixth year and the land will give fruit enough for three years
