 truly those who make sport of me are round about me and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing
 be pleased now to be responsible for me to yourself for there is no other who will put his hand in mine
 you have kept their hearts from wisdom for this cause you will not give them honour
 as for him who is false to his friend for a reward light will be cut off from the eyes of his children
 he has made me a word of shame to the peoples i have become a mark for their sport
 my eyes have become dark because of my pain and all my body is wasted to a shade
 the upright are surprised at this and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil doers
 still the upright keeps on his way and he who has clean hands gets new strength
 but come back now all of you come and i will not see a wise man among you
 my days are past my purposes are broken off even the desires of my heart
 they are changing night into day they say the light is near the dark
 if i am waiting for the underworld as my house if i have made my bed in the dark
 if i say to the earth you are my father and to the worm my mother and my sister
 where then is my hope and who will see my desire
 will they go down with me into the underworld will we go down together into the dust
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 how long will it be before you have done talking get wisdom and then we will say what is in our minds
 why do we seem as beasts in your eyes and as completely without knowledge
 but come back now come you who are wounding yourself in your passion will the earth be given up because of you or a rock be moved out of its place
 for the light of the sinner is put out and the flame of his fire is not shining
 the light is dark in his tent and the light shining over him is put out
 the steps of his strength become short and by his design destruction overtakes him
 his feet take him into the net and he goes walking into the cords
 his foot is taken in the net he comes into its grip
 the twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him and the cord is placed in his way
 he is overcome by fears on every side they go after him at every step
 his strength is made feeble for need of food and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep
 his skin is wasted by disease and his body is food for the worst of diseases
 he is pulled out of his tent where he was safe and he is taken away to the king of fears
 in his tent will be seen that which is not his burning stone is dropped on his house
