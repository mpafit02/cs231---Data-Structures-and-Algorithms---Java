 in the days of pekah king of israel tiglath pileser king of assyria came and took ijon and abel beth maacah and janoah and kedesh and hazor and gilead and galilee and all the land of naphtali and he took the people away to assyria
 and hoshea the son of elah made a secret design against pekah the son of remaliah and attacking him put him to death and became king in his place in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah
 now the rest of the acts of pekah and all he did are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel jotham the son of uzziah became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling for sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha the daughter of zadok
 and he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father uzziah had done
 but he did not take away the high places and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places he was the builder of the higher doorway of the house of the lord
 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 in those days the lord first sent against judah rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah
 and jotham went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and ahaz his son became king in his place
 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham became king of judah
 ahaz was twenty years old when he became king he was ruling for sixteen years in jerusalem he did not do what was right in the eyes of the lord his god as david his father did
 but he went in the ways of the kings of israel and even made his son go through the fire copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the lord had sent out of the land before the children of israel
 and he made offerings burning them in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
 then rezin king of aram and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to make war and they made an attack on ahaz shutting him in but were not able to overcome him
 at that time the king of edom got elath back for edom and sent the jews out of elath and the edomites came back to elath where they are living to this day
 so ahaz sent representatives to tiglath pileser king of assyria saying i am your servant and your son come to my help against the kings of aram and israel who have taken up arms against me
 and ahaz took the silver and gold which were in the house of the lord and in the kings store house and sent them as an offering to the king of assyria
 and the king of assyria in answer to his request went up against damascus and took it and took its people away as prisoners to kir and put rezin to death
 then king ahaz went to damascus for a meeting with tiglath pileser king of assyria and there he saw the altar which was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest a copy of the altar giving the design of it and all the details of its structure
 and from the copy king ahaz sent from damascus urijah made an altar and had it ready by the time king ahaz came back from damascus
 and when the king came from damascus he saw the altar and he went up on it and made an offering on it
 he made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there draining out the blood of his peace offerings on the altar
 and the brass altar which was before the lord he took from the front of the house from between his altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of his altar
 and king ahaz gave orders to urijah the priest saying make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the kings burned offering and meal offering with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings on the great altar and put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the beasts which are offered but the brass altar will be for my use to get directions from the lord
 so urijah the priest did everything as the king said
 and king ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases and took down the great water vessel from off the brass oxen which were under it and put it on a floor of stone
 *** the house of the lord because of the king of assyria
 now the rest of the things which ahaz did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and ahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and hezekiah his son became king in his place
