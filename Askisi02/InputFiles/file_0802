 for when the people were numbered not one man of the people of jabesh gilead was present
 so they  the meeting  sent twelve thousand of the best fighting men and gave them orders saying go and put the people of jabesh gilead to the sword without mercy with their women and their little ones
 and this is what you are to do every male and every woman who has had sex relations with a man you are to put to the curse but you are to keep safe the virgins and they did so
 now there were among the people of jabesh gilead four hundred young virgins who had never had sex relations with a man these they took to their tents in shiloh in the land of canaan
 and all the meeting sent to the men of benjamin who were in the rock of rimmon offering them peace
 then benjamin came back and they gave them the women whom they had kept from death among the women of jabesh gilead but still there were not enough for them
 and the people were moved with pity for benjamin because the lord had let his wrath loose on the tribes of israel
 then the responsible men of the meeting said what are we to do about wives for the rest of them seeing that the women of benjamin are dead
 and they said how is the rest of benjamin to be given offspring so that one tribe of israel may not be put out of existence
 seeing that we may not give them our daughters as wives for the children of israel had taken an oath saying cursed is he who gives a wife to benjamin
 and they said see every year there is a feast of the lord in shiloh which is to the north of beth el on the east side of the highway which goes up from beth el to shechem and on the south of lebonah
 and they said to the men of benjamin go into the vine gardens waiting there secretly
 and watching and if the daughters of shiloh come out to take part in the dances then come from the vine gardens and take a wife for every one of you from among the daughters of shiloh and go back to the land of benjamin
 and when their fathers or their brothers come and make trouble you are to say to them give them to us as an act of grace for we did not take them as wives for ourselves in war and if you yourselves had given them to us you would have been responsible for the broken oath
 so the men of benjamin did this and got wives for themselves for every one of their number taking them away by force from the dance then they went back to their heritage building up their towns and living in them
 then the children of israel went away from there every man to his tribe and his family every man went back to his heritage
 in those days there was no king in israel every man did what seemed right to him
 now these are the nations which the lord kept in the land for the purpose of testing israel by them all those who had had no experience of all the wars of canaan
 only because of the generations of the children of israel for the purpose of teaching them war  only those who up till then had no experience of it
 the five chiefs of the philistines and all the canaanites and the zidonians and the hivites living in mount lebanon from the mountain baal hermon as far as hamath
 for the purpose of testing israel by them to see if they would give ear to the orders of the lord which he had given to their fathers by the hand of moses
 now the children of israel were living among the canaanites the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
 and they took as wives the daughters of these nations and gave their daughters to their sons and became servants to their gods
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and put out of their minds the lord their god and became servants to the baals and the astartes
 so the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel were his servants for eight years
 and when the children of israel made prayer to the lord he gave them a saviour othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother
 and the spirit of the lord came on him and he became judge of israel and went out to war and the lord gave up cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hands and he overcame him
 then for forty years the land had peace till the death of othniel the son of kenaz
 then the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord made eglon king of moab strong against israel because they had done evil in the lords eyes
 and eglon got together the people of ammon and amalek and they went and overcame israel and took the town of palm trees
