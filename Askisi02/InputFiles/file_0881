 and balaam said to god balak the son of zippor king of moab has sent them to me saying
 see the people who have come out of egypt are covering all the earth now put a curse on this people for me so that i may be able to make war on them driving them out of the land
 and god said to balaam you are not to go with them or put a curse on this people for they have my blessing
 in the morning balaam got up and said to the chiefs of balak go back to your land for the lord will not let me go with you
 so the chiefs of moab went back to balak and said balaam will not come with us
 so balak sent more chiefs greater in number and of higher position than the others
 and they came to balaam and said balak son of zippor says let nothing keep you from coming to me
 for i will give you a place of very great honour and whatever you say to me i will do so come in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people
 but balaam in answer said to the servants of balak even if balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to do anything more or less than the orders of the lord my god
 so take your rest here this night till i have knowledge what more the lord has to say to me
 and that night god came to balaam and said to him if these men have come for you go with them but do only what i say to you
 so in the morning balaam got up and making his ass ready went with the chiefs of moab
 but god was moved to wrath because he went and the angel of the lord took up a position in the road to keep him from his purpose now he was seated on his ass and his two servants were with him
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord waiting in the road with his sword in his hand and turning from the road the ass went into the field and balaam gave the ass blows to get her back on to the road
 then the angel of the lord took up his position in a narrow road through the vine gardens with a wall on this side and on that
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord and went near the wall crushing balaams foot against the wall and he gave her more blows
 then the angel of the lord went further stopping in a narrow place where there was no room for turning to the right or to the left
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord and went down on the earth under balaam and full of wrath balaam gave her hard blows with his stick
 then the lord gave the ass the power of talking and opening her mouth she said to balaam what have i done to you that you have given me blows these three times
 and balaam said to the ass you have made me seem foolish if only i had a sword in my hand i would put you to death
 and the ass said to balaam am i not your ass upon which you have gone all your life till this day and have i ever done this to you before and he said no
 then the lord made balaams eyes open and he saw the angel of the lord in the way with his sword in his hand and he went down on his face to the earth
 and the angel of the lord said to him why have you given your ass blows these three times see i have come out against you to keep you back because your purpose is not pleasing to me
 and the ass saw me turning to one side from me three times if she had not gone to one side i would certainly have put you to death and kept her safe
 and balaam said to the angel of the lord i have done wrong for i did not see that you were in the way against me but now if it is evil in your eyes i will go back again
 and the angel of the lord said to balaam go with the men but say only what i give you to say then balaam went on with the chiefs of balak
 now balak hearing that balaam had come went to the chief town of moab on the edge of the arnon in the farthest part of the land for the purpose of meeting him
 and balak said to balaam did i not send to you requesting you with all my heart to come to me why did you not come am i not able to give you a place of honour
 then balaam said to balak now i have come to you but have i power to say anything only what god puts into my mouth may i say
 and balaam went with balak to kiriath huzoth
