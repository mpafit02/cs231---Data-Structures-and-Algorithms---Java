 and when the time comes for you to go to your fathers i will put in your place your seed after you one of your sons and i will make his kingdom strong
 he will be the builder of my house and i will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
 i will be to him a father and he will be to me a son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him who was before you
 but i will make his place in my house and in my kingdom certain for ever and the seat of his authority will never be overturned
 so nathan gave david an account of all these words and this vision
 then david the king went in and took his seat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
 and this was only a small thing to you o god but your words have even been about the far off future of your servants family looking on me as on one of high position o lord god
 what more may david say to you for you have knowledge of your servant
 o lord because of your servant and from your heart you have done all these great things and let them be seen
 o lord there is no one like you and no other god but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
 and what other nation in the earth like your people israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people making his name great and to be feared driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of egypt
 for your people israel you made yours for ever and you lord became their god
 and now lord let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever and do as you have said
 so let your words be made certain and your name be made great when men say the lord of armies is the god of israel and when the family of david your servant is made strong before you
 for you o my god have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings and so it has come into your servants heart to make his prayer to you
 and now o lord you are god and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant
 and now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant so that it may go on for ever before you you o lord have given your blessing and a blessing will be on it for ever
 and it came about after this that david made an attack on the philistines and overcame them and took gath with its daughter towns out of the hands of the philistines
 and he overcame moab and the moabites became his servants and gave him offerings
 then david overcame hadadezer king of zobah near hamath when he was going to make his power seen by the river euphrates
 and david took from him a thousand war carriages and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and he had the leg muscles of all the horses cut keeping only enough of them for a hundred war carriages
 and when the aramaeans of damascus came to the help of hadadezer king of zobah david put to the sword twenty two thousand aramaeans
 then david put armed forces in damascus and the aramaeans became his servants and gave him offerings and the lord made david overcome wherever he went
 and the gold body covers of the servants of hadadezer david took to jerusalem
 and from tibhath and from cun towns of hadadezer david took a great store of brass of which solomon made the great brass water vessel and the brass pillars and vessels
 now when tou king of hamath had news that david had overcome all the army of hadadezer king of zobah
 he sent his son hadoram to king david to give him words of peace and blessing because he had overcome hadadezer in the fight for hadadezer had been at war with tou and he gave him all sorts of vessels of gold and silver and brass
