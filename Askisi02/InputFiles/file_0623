 then joseph made a law which is in force to this day that pharaoh was to have the fifth part only the land of the priests did not become his
 and so israel was living among the egyptians in the land of goshen and they got property there and became very great in numbers and in wealth
 and jacob was living in the land of goshen for seventeen years so the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven
 and the time of his death came near and he sent for his son joseph and said to him if now i am dear to you put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in egypt
 but when i go to my fathers you are to take me out of egypt and put me to rest in their last resting place and he said i will do so
 and he said take an oath to me and he took an oath to him and israel gave worship on the beds head
 now after these things word came to joseph that his father was ill and he took with him his sons manasseh and ephraim
 and when they said to jacob your son joseph is coming to see you then israel getting all his strength together had himself lifted up in his bed
 and jacob said to joseph god the ruler of all came to me in a vision at luz in the land of canaan and gave me his blessing
 and said to me truly i will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations and i will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever
 and now your two sons who came to birth in egypt before i came to you here are mine ephraim and manasseh will be mine in the same way as reuben and simeon are
 and any other offspring which you have after them will be yours and will be named after their brothers in their heritage
 and as for me when i came from paddan death overtook rachel on the way when we were still some distance from ephrath and i put her to rest there on the road to ephrath which is beth lehem
 then israel looking at josephs sons said who are these
 and joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me in this land and he said let them come near me and i will give them a blessing
 now because israel was old his eyes were no longer clear and he was not able to see so he made them come near to him and he gave them a kiss folding them in his arms
 and israel said to joseph i had no hope of seeing your face again but god in his mercy has let me see you and your children
 then joseph took them from between his knees and went down on his face to the earth
 then taking ephraim with his right hand joseph put him at israels left side and with his left hand he put manasseh at israels right side placing them near him
 and israel stretching out his right hand put it on the head of ephraim the younger and his left hand on the head of manasseh crossing his hands on purpose for manasseh was the older
 and he gave joseph a blessing saying may the god to whom my fathers abraham and isaac gave worship the god who has taken care of me all my life till this day
 the angel who has been my saviour from all evil send his blessing on these children and let my name and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac be given to them and let them become a great nation in the earth
 now when joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of ephraim it did not seem right to him and lifting his fathers hand he would have put it on the head of manasseh
 and joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the older put your right hand on his head
 but his father would not saying i am doing it on purpose my son he will certainly become a nation and a great one but his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a great family of nations
 so he gave them his blessing that day saying you will be the sign of blessing in israel for they will say may god make you like ephraim and manasseh and he put ephraim before manasseh
 then israel said to joseph now my death is near but god will be with you guiding you back to the land of your fathers
 and i have given you more than your brothers even shechem as your heritage which i took from the amorites with my sword and my bow
 and jacob sent for his sons and said come together all of you so that i may give you news of your fate in future times
 come near o sons of jacob and give ear to the words of israel your father
