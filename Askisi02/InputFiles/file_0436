 then the king gave shadrach meshach and abed nego even greater authority in the land of babylon
 nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth may your peace be increased
 it has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the most high god has done with me
 how great are his signs  and how full of power are his wonders  his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and his rule goes on from generation to generation
 i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my place and all things were going well for me in my great house
 i saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me i was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed and by the visions of my head
 and i gave orders for all the wise men of babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream
 then the wonder workers the users of secret arts the chaldaeans and the readers of signs came in to me and i put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me
 but at last daniel came in before me he whose name was belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and i put the dream before him saying
 o belteshazzar master of the wonder workers because i am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and you are troubled by no secret this is the dream which i saw make clear to me its sense
 on my bed i saw a vision there was a tree in the middle of the earth and it was very high
 and the tree became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and to be seen from the ends of the earth
 its leaves were fair and it had much fruit and in it was food enough for all the beasts of the field had shade under it and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches and it gave food to all living things
 in the visions of my head on my bed i saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven
 crying out with a loud voice and this is what he said let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction let the beasts get away from under it and the birds from its branches
 but keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth even with a band of iron and brass let him have the young grass of the field for food and let him be wet with the dew of heaven and let his part be with the beasts
 let his heart be changed from that of a man and the heart of a beast be given to him and let seven times go by him
 this order is fixed by the watchers and the decision is by the word of the holy ones so that the living may be certain that the most high is ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure lifting up over it the lowest of men
 this dream i king nebuchadnezzar saw and do you o belteshazzar make clear the sense of it for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me but you are able for the spirit of the holy gods is in you
 then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was at a loss for a time his thoughts troubling him the king made answer and said belteshazzar do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it belteshazzar answering said my lord may the dream be about your haters and its sense about those who are against you
 the tree which you saw which became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth
 which had fair leaves and much fruit and had in it food for all under which the beasts of the field were living and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their resting places
 it is you o king who have become great and strong for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven and your rule to the end of the earth
 and as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven saying let the tree be cut down and given to destruction
 this is the sense of it o king and it is the decision of the most high which has come on my lord the king
 that they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and you will be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
 and as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling
 for this cause o king let my suggestion be pleasing to you and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evil doing by mercy to the poor so that the time of your well being may be longer
 all this came to king nebuchadnezzar
 at the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in babylon
