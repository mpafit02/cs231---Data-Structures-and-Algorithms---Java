 so all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying come back to me the third day
 and the king gave them a rough answer giving no attention to the suggestion of the old men
 but giving them the answer put forward by the young men saying my father made your yoke hard but i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give it with snakes
 so the king did not give ear to the people and this came about by the purpose of the lord so that what he had said by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam son of nebat might be effected
 and when all israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king what part have we in david what is our heritage in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to your people david so israel went away to their tents
  but rehoboam was still king over those of the children of israel who were living in the towns of judah 
 then king rehoboam sent adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all israel and king rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to jerusalem
 so israel was turned away from the family of david to this day
 now when all israel had news that jeroboam had come back they sent for him to come before the meeting of the people and made him king over israel not one of them was joined to the family of david but only the tribe of judah
 when rehoboam came to jerusalem he got together all the men of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting men to make war against israel and get the kingdom back for rehoboam the son of solomon
 but the word of god came to shemaiah the man of god saying
 say to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all the men of judah and benjamin and the rest of the people
 the lord has said you are not to go to war against your brothers the children of israel go back every man to his house because this thing is my purpose so they gave ear to the word of the lord and went back as the lord had said
 then jeroboam made the town of shechem in the hill country of ephraim a strong place and was living there and from there he went out and did the same to penuel
 and jeroboam said in his heart now the kingdom will go back to the family of david
 if the people go up to make offerings in the house of the lord at jerusalem their heart will be turned again to their lord to rehoboam king of judah and they will put me to death and go back to rehoboam king of judah
 so after taking thought the king made two oxen of gold and he said to the people you have been going up to jerusalem long enough see  these are your gods o israel who took you out of the land of egypt
 and he put one in beth el and the other in dan
 and this became a sin in israel for the people went to give worship to the one at beth el and to the other at dan
 and he made places for worship at the high places and made priests who were not levites from among all the people
 and jeroboam gave orders for a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like the feast which is kept in judah and he went up to the altar and in the same way in beth el he gave offerings to the oxen which he had made placing in beth el the priests of the high places he had made
 he went up to the altar he had made in beth el on the fifteenth day of the eighth month the month fixed by him at his pleasure and he gave orders for a feast for the people of israel and went up to the altar and there he made the smoke of his offerings go up
 then a man of god came from judah by the order of the lord to beth el where jeroboam was by the altar burning offerings
 and by the order of the lord he made an outcry against the altar saying o altar altar the lord has said from the seed of david will come a child named josiah and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places who are burning offerings on you and mens bones will be burned on you
 the same day he gave them a sign saying this is the sign which the lord has given see the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned
 then the king hearing the man of god crying out against the altar at beth el put out his hand from the altar saying take him prisoner and his hand stretched out against him became dead and he had no power of pulling it back
 and the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned this was the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord
 then the king made answer and said to the man of god make a prayer now for the grace of the lord your god and for me that my hand may be made well and in answer to the prayer of the man of god the kings hand was made well again as it was before
 and the king said to the man of god come with me to my house for food and rest and i will give you a reward
 but the man of god said to the king even if you gave me half of all you have i would not go in with you and i would not take food or a drink of water in this place
