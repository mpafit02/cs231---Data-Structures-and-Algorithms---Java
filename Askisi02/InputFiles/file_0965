 i am shut in by you on every side and you have put your hand on me
 such knowledge is a wonder greater than my powers it is so high that i may not come near it
 where may i go from your spirit how may i go in flight from you
 if i go up to heaven you are there or if i make my bed in the underworld you are there
 if i take the wings of the morning and go to the farthest parts of the sea
 even there will i be guided by your hand and your right hand will keep me
 if i say only let me be covered by the dark and the light about me be night
 even the dark is not dark to you the night is as bright as the day for dark and light are the same to you
 my flesh was made by you and my parts joined together in my mothers body
 i will give you praise for i am strangely and delicately formed your works are great wonders and of this my soul is fully conscious
 my frame was not unseen by you when i was made secretly and strangely formed in the lowest parts of the earth
 your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book all my days were recorded even those which were purposed before they had come into being
 how dear are your thoughts to me o god  how great is the number of them 
 if i made up their number it would be more than the grains of sand when i am awake i am still with you
 if only you would put the sinners to death o god go far from me you men of blood
 for they go against you with evil designs and your haters make sport of your name
 are not your haters hated by me o lord are not those who are lifted up against you a cause of grief to me
 my hate for them is complete my thoughts of them are as if they were making war on me
 o god let the secrets of my heart be uncovered and let my wandering thoughts be tested
 see if there is any way of sorrow in me and be my guide in the eternal way
 &ltto the chief music maker of david&gt the foolish man has said in his heart god will not do anything they are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
 the lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after god
 they have all gone out of the way together they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
 have all the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to the lord
 then were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the upright
 you have put to shame the thoughts of the poor but the lord is his support
 may the salvation of israel come out of zion  when the fate of his people is changed by the lord jacob will have joy and israel will be glad
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt o lord take me out of the power of the evil man keep me safe from the violent man
 for their hearts are full of evil designs and they are ever making ready causes of war
 their tongues are sharp like the tongue of a snake the poison of snakes is under their lips  selah
