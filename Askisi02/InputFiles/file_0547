 say to them these are the words of the lord see i am against you pharaoh king of egypt the great river beast stretched out among his nile streams who has said the nile is mine and i have made it for myself
 and i will put hooks in your mouth and the fish of your streams will be hanging from your skin and i will make you come up out of your streams with all the fish of your streams hanging from your skin
 and i will let you be in the waste land you and all the fish of your streams you will go down on the face of the land you will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth i have given you for food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven
 and it will be clear to all the people of egypt that i am the lord because you have been a false support to the children of israel
 when they took a grip of you in their hands you were crushed so that their arms were broken and when they put their weight on you for support you were broken and all their muscles gave way
 for this cause the lord has said see i am sending a sword on you cutting off from you man and beast
 and the land of egypt will be an unpeopled waste and they will be certain that i am the lord because he has said the nile is mine and i made it
 see then i am against you and against your streams and i will make the land of egypt an unpeopled waste from migdol to syene even as far as the edge of ethiopia
 no foot of man will go through it and no foot of beast and it will be unpeopled for forty years
 i will make the land of egypt a waste among the countries which are made waste and her towns will be unpeopled among the towns which have been made waste for forty years and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
 for this is what the lord has said at the end of forty years i will get the egyptians together from the peoples where they have gone in flight
 i will let the fate of egypt be changed and will make them come back into the land of pathros into the land from which they came and there they will be an unimportant kingdom
 it will be the lowest of the kingdoms and never again will it be lifted up over the nations i will make them small so that they may not have rule over the nations
 and egypt will no longer be the hope of the children of israel causing sin to come to mind when their eyes are turned to them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the twenty seventh year in the first month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made his army do hard work against tyre and the hair came off every head and every arm was rubbed smooth but he and his army got no payment out of tyre for the hard work which he had done against it
 for this cause the lord has said see i am giving the land of egypt to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he will take away her wealth and take her goods by force and everything which is there and this will be the payment for his army
 i have given him the land of egypt as the reward for his hard work because they were working for me says the lord
 in that day i will make a horn put out buds for the children of israel and i will let your words come freely among them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and he said to me son of man take this roll for your food and go and say my words to the children of israel
 and on my opening my mouth he made me take the roll as food
 and he said to me son of man let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which i am giving you then i took it and it was sweet as honey in my mouth
 and he said to me son of man go now to the children of israel and say my words to them
 for you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard but to the children of israel
 not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you truly if i sent you to them they would give ear to you
 but the children of israel will not give ear to you for they have no mind to give ear to me for all the children of israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart
 see i have made your face hard against their faces and your brow hard against their brows
 like a diamond harder than rock i have made your brow have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
 then he said to me son of man take into your heart all my words which i am about to say to you and let your ears be open to them
 and go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners to the children of your people and say to them this is what the lord has said if they give ear or if they do not
