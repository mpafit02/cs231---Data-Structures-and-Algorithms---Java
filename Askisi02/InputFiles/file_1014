 my eyes are wasting away because of my trouble lord my cry has gone up to you every day my hands are stretched out to you
 will you do works of wonder for the dead will the shades come back to give you praise  selah 
 will the story of your mercy be given in the house of the dead will news of your faith come to the place of destruction
 may there be knowledge of your wonders in the dark or of your righteousness where memory is dead
 but to you did i send up my cry o lord in the morning my prayer came before you
 lord why have you sent away my soul why is your face covered from me
 i have been troubled and in fear of death from the time when i was young your wrath is hard on me and i have no strength
 the heat of your wrath has gone over me i am broken by your cruel punishments
 they are round me all the day like water they have made a circle about me
 you have sent my friends and lovers far from me i am gone from the memory of those who are dear to me
 &ltmaschil of ethan the ezrahite&gt my song will be of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth will i make his faith clear to all generations
 for you have said mercy will be made strong for ever my faith will be unchanging in the heavens
 i have made an agreement with the man of my selection i have made an oath to david my servant
 i will make your seed go on for ever your kingdom will be strong through all generations  selah 
 in heaven let them give praise for your wonders o lord and your unchanging faith among the saints
 for who is there in the heavens in comparison with the lord who is like the lord among the sons of the gods
 god is greatly to be feared among the saints and to be honoured over all those who are about him
 o lord god of armies who is strong like you o jah and your unchanging faith is round about you
 you have rule over the sea in storm when its waves are troubled you make them calm
 rahab was crushed by you like one wounded to death with your strong arm you put to flight all your haters
 yours are the heavens and the earth is yours you have made the world and everything which is in it
 you have made the north and the south tabor and hermon are sounding with joy at your name
 yours is an arm of power strong is your hand and high your right hand
 the seat of your kingdom is resting on righteousness and right judging mercy and good faith come before your face
 happy are the people who have knowledge of the holy cry the light of your face o lord will be shining on their way
 in your name will they have joy all the day in your righteousness will they be lifted up
 for you are the glory of their strength in your pleasure will our horn be lifted up
 for our breastplate is the lord and our king is the holy one of israels
 then your voice came to your holy one in a vision saying i have put the crown on a strong one lifting up one taken from among the people
 i have made discovery of david my servant i have put my holy oil on his head
