 who will not be moved by the voice of the wonder worker however great are his powers
 o god let their teeth be broken in their mouths let the great teeth of the young lions be pulled out o lord
 let them be turned to liquid like the ever flowing waters let them be cut off like the grass by the way
 let them be like an after birth which is turned to water and comes to an end like the fruit of a woman who gives birth before her time let them not see the sun
 before they are conscious of it let them be cut down like thorns let a strong wind take them away like waste growth
 the upright man will be glad when he sees their punishment his feet will be washed in the blood of the evil doer
 so that men will say truly there is a reward for righteousness truly there is a god who is judge on the earth
 &ltto the chief music maker put to at tashheth michtam of david when saul sent and they were watching the house to put him to death&gt take me out of the hands of the cruel ones o my god keep me safe from those who come up against me
 take me out of the power of the workers of evil and keep me safe from the men of blood
 for see they are watching in secret for my soul the strong have come together against me but not because of my sin or my evil doing o lord
 for no sin of mine they go quickly and get themselves ready be awake and come to my help and see
 you o lord god of armies are the god of israel come now and give punishment to the nations have no mercy on any workers of deceit  selah 
 they come back in the evening they make a noise like a dog and go round the town
 see hate is dropping from their lips curses are on their tongues they say who gives attention to it
 but you are laughing at them o lord you will make sport of all the nations
 o my strength i will put my hope in you because god is my strong tower
 the god of my mercy will go before me god will let me see my desire effected on my haters
 put them not to death for so my people will keep the memory of them let them be sent in all directions by your power make them low o lord our saviour
 because of the sin of their mouths and the word of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for their curses and their deceit
 put an end to them in your wrath put an end to them so that they may not be seen again let them see that god is ruling in jacob and to the ends of the earth  selah 
 and in the evening let them come back and make a noise like a dog and go round the town
 let them go wandering up and down in search of food and be there all night if they have not enough
 but i will make songs of your power yes i will give cries of joy for your mercy in the morning because you have been my strength and my high tower in the day of my trouble
 to you o my strength will i make my song because god is my high tower even the god of my mercy
 &ltto the chief music maker on corded instruments on the sheminith a psalm of david&gt o lord do not be bitter with me in your wrath do not send punishment on me in the heat of your passion
 have mercy on me o lord for i am wasted away make me well for even my bones are troubled
 my soul is in bitter trouble and you o lord how long
 come back o lord make my soul free o give me salvation because of your mercy
 for in death there is no memory of you in the underworld who will give you praise
 the voice of my sorrow is a weariness to me all the night i make my bed wet with weeping it is watered by the drops flowing from my eyes
