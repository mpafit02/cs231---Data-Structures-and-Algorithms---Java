 and it came about after a little time that he went to a town named nain and his disciples went with him and a great number of people
 now when he came near the door of the town a dead man was being taken out the only son of his mother who was a widow and a great number of people from the town were with her
 and when the lord saw her he had pity on her and said to her be not sad
 and he came near and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was and those who were moving it came to a stop and he said young man i say to you get up
 and the dead man got up and words came from his lips and he gave him to his mother
 and fear came on all and they gave praise to god saying a great prophet is among us and god has given thought to his people
 and this story about him went through all judaea and the places round about
 and the disciples of john gave him an account of all these things
 then john sent two of his disciples to the lord saying are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 and when the men came to him they said john the baptist has sent us to you saying are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 at that time he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains and from evil spirits and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes
 and answering them he said go back and give news to john of what you have seen and the things which have come to your ears the blind now see those who had no power in their legs are walking lepers are made clean those who had no hearing now have their ears open dead men come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
 and a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
 and when the men who were sent by john had gone away he said to the people about john what did you go out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
 but what did you go out to see a man in soft clothing see now those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings houses
 but what did you go out to see a prophet yes i say to you and more than a prophet
 this is he of whom it has been said see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
 i say to you among all the sons of women not one is greater than john but he who is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
  and all the people and the tax farmers to whom john had given baptism when they had knowledge of these things gave glory to god
 but the pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of god for themselves not having had his baptism 
 what comparison am i to make of the men of this generation what are they like
 they are like children who are seated in the market place crying out to one another and saying we made music for you but you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow but you were not sad
 for john the baptist came taking no food or drink and you say he has an evil spirit
 the son of man came feasting and you say here is a lover of food and wine a friend of tax farmers and sinners
 but wisdom is judged to be right by all her children
 and one of the pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his seat at the table
 and there was a woman in the town who was a sinner and when she had news that he was a guest in the pharisees house she took a bottle of perfume
 and went in and took her place at the back of him near his feet weeping so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes and with her hair she made them dry and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them
 now when the pharisee in whose house he was saw it he said to himself this man if he was a prophet would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him that she is a sinner
 and jesus answering said simon i have something to say to you and he said master say on
