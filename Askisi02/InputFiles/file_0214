 what is your opinion of the christ whose son is he they say to him the son of david
 he says to them how then does david in the spirit give him the name of lord saying
 the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put under your feet all those who are against you
 if david then gives him the name of lord how is he his son
 and no one was able to give him an answer and so great was their fear of him that from that day no one put any more questions to him
 then jesus said to the people and to his disciples
 the scribes and the pharisees have the authority of moses
 all things then which they give you orders to do these do and keep but do not take their works as your example for they say and do not
 they make hard laws and put great weights on mens backs but they themselves will not put a finger to them
 but all their works they do so as to be seen by men for they make wide their phylacteries and the edges of their robes
 and the things desired by them are the first places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
 and words of respect in the market places and to be named by men teacher
 but you may not be named teacher for one is your teacher and you are all brothers
 and give no man the name of father on earth because one is your father who is in heaven
 and you may not be named guides because one is your guide even christ
 but let the greatest among you be your servant
 and whoever makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
 but a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men for you do not go in yourselves and those who are going in you keep back
   
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and having him you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves
 a curse is on you blind guides who say whoever takes an oath by the temple it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the temple he is responsible
 you foolish ones and blind which is greater the gold or the temple which makes the gold holy
 and whoever takes an oath by the altar it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it he is responsible
 you blind ones which is greater the offering or the altar which makes the offering holy
 he then who takes an oath by the altar takes it by the altar and by all things on it
 and he who takes an oath by the temple takes it by the temple and by him whose house it is
 and he who takes an oath by heaven takes it by the seat of god and by him who is seated on it
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweet smelling plants but you give no thought to the more important things of the law righteousness and mercy and faith but it is right for you to do these and not to let the others be undone
 you blind guides who take out a fly from your drink but make no trouble over a camel
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire
