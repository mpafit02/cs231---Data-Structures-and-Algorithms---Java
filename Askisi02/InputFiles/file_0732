 is any one able to take up the argument against me if so i would keep quiet and give up my breath
 only two things do not do to me then i will come before your face
 take your hand far away from me and let me not be overcome by fear of you
 then at the sound of your voice i will give answer or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer
 what is the number of my evil doings and my sins give me knowledge of them
 why is your face veiled from me as if i was numbered among your haters
 will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way
 for you put bitter things on record against me and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years
 and you put chains on my feet watching all my ways and making a limit for my steps
 though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood or like a robe which has become food for the worm
 as for man the son of woman his days are short and full of trouble
 he comes out like a flower and is cut down he goes in flight like a shade and is never seen again
 is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed with the purpose of judging him
 if only a clean thing might come out of an unclean  but it is not possible
 if his days are ordered and you have knowledge of the number of his months having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go
 let your eyes be turned away from him and take your hand from him so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day like a servant working for payment
 for there is hope of a tree if it is cut down it will come to life again and its branches will not come to an end
 though its root may be old in the earth and its cut off end may be dead in the dust
 still at the smell of water it will make buds and put out branches like a young plant
 but man comes to his death and is gone he gives up his spirit and where is he
 the waters go from a pool and a river becomes waste and dry
 so man goes down to his last resting place and comes not again till the heavens come to an end they will not be awake or come out of their sleep
 if only you would keep me safe in the underworld putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past giving me a fixed time when i might come to your memory again 
 if death takes a man will he come to life again all the days of my trouble i would be waiting till the time came for me to be free
 at the sound of your voice i would give an answer and you would have a desire for the work of your hands
 for now my steps are numbered by you and my sin is not overlooked
 my wrongdoing is corded up in a bag and my sin is shut up safe
 but truly a mountain falling comes to dust and a rock is moved from its place
 the stones are crushed small by the force of the waters the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing and so you put an end to the hope of man
 you overcome him for ever and he is gone his face is changed in death and you send him away
