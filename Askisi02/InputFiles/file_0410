 and the saying was pleasing to absalom and to the responsible men of israel
 then absalom said now send for hushai the archite and let us give ear to what he has to say
 and when hushai came absalom said to him this is what ahithophel has said are we to do as he says if not what is your suggestion
 and hushai said to absalom ahithophels idea is not a good one at this time
 hushai said further you have knowledge of your father and his men that they are men of war and that their feelings are bitter like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her and your father is a man of war and will not take his nights rest with the people
 but he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place and if some of our people at the first attack are overcome then any hearing of it will say there is destruction among the people who are on absaloms side
 then even the strongest whose heart is like the heart of a lion will become like water for all israel is conscious that your father is a man of war and those who are with him are strong and without fear
 but my suggestion is that all israel from dan as far as beer sheba comes together to you a great army like the sands of the sea in number and that you yourself go out among them
 then we will come on him in some place wherever he may be falling on him as the dew comes on the earth and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life
 and if he has gone into some town then let all israel take strong cords to that town and we will have it pulled into the valley till not one small stone is to be seen there
 then absalom and all the men of israel said hushais suggestion is better than that of ahithophel for it was the purpose of the lord to make the wise designs of ahithophel without effect so that the lord might send evil on absalom
 then hushai said to zadok and abiathar the priests this is the suggestion made by ahithophel to absalom and the responsible men of israel and this is what i said to them
 so now send the news quickly to david and say do not take your nights rest by the way across the river to the waste land but be certain to go over or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction
 now jonathan and ahimaaz were waiting by en rogel and a servant girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to king david for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town
 but a boy saw them and gave word of it to absalom so the two of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man in bahurim who had a water hole in his garden and they went down into it
 and a woman put a cover over the hole and put crushed grain on top of it and no one had any knowledge of it
 and absaloms servants came to the woman at the house and said where are ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said to them they have gone from here to the stream and after searching for them and seeing nothing of them they went back to jerusalem
 then after the servants had gone away they came up out of the water hole and went to give king david the news and they said get up and go quickly over the water for such and such are ahithophels designs against you
 so david and all the people who were with him went up over jordan when dawn came every one of them had gone over jordan
 now when ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on he got his ass ready and went back to his house to the town where he came from and having put his house in order he put himself to death by hanging so he came to his end and was put in the resting place of his father
 and david came to mahanaim and absalom with all the men of israel went over jordan
 and absalom put amasa at the head of the army in place of joab now amasa was the son of a man named ithra the ishmaelite who had been the lover of abigail the daughter of jesse sister of zeruiah joabs mother
 and israel and absalom put up their tents in the land of gilead
 now when david had come to mahanaim shobi the son of nahash of rabbah the ammonite and machir the son of ammiel of lo debar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim
 came with beds and basins and pots and grain and meal and all sorts of dry foods
 and honey and butter and sheep and milk cheeses for david and his people for they said this people is in the waste land needing food and drink and rest
 and david had the people who were with him numbered and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
 and david sent the people out a third of them under the orders of joab and a third under the orders of abishai son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third under ittai the gittite and the king said to the people and i myself will certainly go out with you
 but the people said it is better for you not to go out for if we are put to flight they will not give a thought to us and if death overtakes half of us it will be nothing to them but you are of more value than ten thousand of us so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town
 and the king said to them i will do whatever seems best to you so the king took his place by the door of the town and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands
