 and weeping for joy jacob gave rachel a kiss
 and rachel hearing from jacob that he was her fathers relation and that he was the son of rebekah went running to give her father news of it
 and laban hearing news of jacob his sisters son came running and took jacob in his arms and kissing him made him come into his house and jacob gave him news of everything
 and laban said to him truly you are my bone and my flesh and he kept jacob with him for the space of a month
 then laban said to jacob because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing say now what is your payment to be
 now laban had two daughters the name of the older was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
 and leahs eyes were clouded but rachel was fair in face and form
 and jacob was in love with rachel and he said i will be your servant seven years for rachel your younger daughter
 and laban said it is better for you to have her than another man go on living here with me
 and jacob did seven years work for rachel and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time
 then jacob said to laban give me my wife so that i may have her for the days are ended
 and laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast
 and in the evening he took leah his daughter and gave her to him and he went in to her
 and laban gave zilpah his servant girl to leah to be her waiting woman
 and in the morning jacob saw that it was leah and he said to laban what have you done to me was i not working for you so that i might have rachel why have you been false to me
 and laban said in our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older
 let the week of the bride feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition if you will be my servant for another seven years
 and jacob did so and when the week was ended laban gave him his daughter rachel for his wife
 and laban gave rachel his servant girl bilhah to be her waiting woman
 then jacob took rachel as his wife and his love for her was greater than his love for leah and he went on working for laban for another seven years
 now the lord seeing that leah was not loved gave her a child while rachel had no children
 and leah was with child and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name reuben for she said the lord has seen my sorrow now my husband will have love for me
 then she became with child again and gave birth to a son and said because it has come to the lords ears that i am not loved he has given me this son in addition and she gave him the name simeon
 and she was with child again and gave birth to a son and said now at last my husband will be united to me because i have given him three sons so he was named levi
 and she was with child again and gave birth to a son and she said this time i will give praise to the lord so he was named judah after this she had no more children for a time
 now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said to the woman has god truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden
 and the woman said we may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden
 but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god has said if you take of it or put your hands on it death will come to you
 and the snake said death will not certainly come to you
 for god sees that on the day when you take of its fruit your eyes will be open and you will be as gods having knowledge of good and evil
