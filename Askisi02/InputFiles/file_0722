 they are nothing a work of error in the time of their punishment destruction will overtake them
 the heritage of jacob is not like these for the maker of all things is his heritage the lord of armies is his name
 you are my fighting axe and my instrument of war with you the nations will be broken with you kingdoms will be broken
 with you the horse and the horseman will be broken with you the war carriage and he who goes in it will be broken
 with you man and woman will be broken with you the old man and the boy will be broken with you the young man and the virgin will be broken
 with you the keeper of sheep with his flock will be broken and with you the farmer and his oxen will be broken and with you captains and rulers will be broken
 and i will give to babylon and to all the people of chaldaea their reward for all the evil they have done in zion before your eyes says the lord
 see i am against you says the lord o mountain of destruction causing the destruction of all the earth and my hand will be stretched out on you rolling you down from the rocks and making you a burned mountain
 and they will not take from you a stone for the angle of a wall or the base of a building but you will be a waste place for ever says the lord
 let a flag be lifted up in the land let the horn be sounded among the nations make the nations ready against her get the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashkenaz together against her make ready a scribe against her let the horses come up against her like massed locusts
 make the nations ready for war against her the king of the medes and his rulers and all his captains and all the land under his rule
 and the land is shaking and in pain for the purposes of the lord are fixed to make the land of babylon an unpeopled waste
 babylons men of war have kept back from the fight waiting in their strong places their strength has given way they have become like women her houses have been put on fire her locks are broken
 one man running will give word to another and one who goes with news will be handing it on to another to give word to the king of babylon that his town has been taken from every quarter
 and the ways across the river have been taken and the water holes  burned with fire and the men of war are in the grip of fear
 for these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a grain floor when it is stamped down before long the time of her grain cutting will come
 nebuchadrezzar king of babylon has made a meal of me violently crushing me he has made me a vessel with nothing in it he has taken me in his mouth like a dragon he has made his stomach full with my delicate flesh crushing me with his teeth
 may the violent things done to me and my downfall come on babylon the daughter of zion will say and may my blood be on the people of chaldaea jerusalem will say
 for this reason the lord has said see i will give support to your cause and take payment for what you have undergone i will make her sea dry and her fountain without water
 and babylon will become a mass of broken walls a hole for jackals a cause of wonder and surprise without a living man in it
 they will be crying out together like lions their voices will be like the voices of young lions
 when they are heated i will make a feast for them and overcome them with wine so that they may become unconscious sleeping an eternal sleep without awaking says the lord
 i will make them go down to death like lambs like he goats together
 how is babylon taken  and the praise of all the earth surprised  how has babylon become a cause of wonder among the nations 
 the sea has come up over babylon she is covered with the mass of its waves
 her towns have become a waste a dry and unwatered land where no man has his living place and no son of man goes by
 and i will send punishment on bel in babylon and take out of his mouth what went into it no longer will the nations be flowing together to him truly the wall of babylon will come down
 my people go out from her and let every man get away safe from the burning wrath of the lord
 so that your hearts may not become feeble and full of fear because of the news which will go about in the land for a story will go about one year and after that in another year another story and violent acts in the land ruler against ruler
 for this cause truly the days are coming when i will send punishment on the images of babylon and all her land will be shamed and her dead will be falling down in her
