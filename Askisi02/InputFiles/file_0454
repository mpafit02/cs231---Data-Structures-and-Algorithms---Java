 and say to them this son of ours is hard hearted and uncontrolled he will not give attention to us he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink
 then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town so you are to put away the evil from among you and all israel hearing of it will be full of fear
 if a man does a crime for which the punishment is death and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree

 if you see your brothers ox or his sheep wandering do not go by without helping but take them back to your brother
 if their owner is not near or if you are not certain who he is then take the beast to your house and keep it till its owner comes in search of it and then you are to give it back to him
 do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brothers keeping and which you have come across do not keep it to yourself
 if you see your brothers ox or his ass falling down on the road do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again
 it is not right for a woman to be dressed in mans clothing or for a man to put on a womans robe whoever does such things is disgusting to the lord your god
 if by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth with young ones or eggs and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs do not take the mother bird with the young

 on the four edges of your robe with which your body is covered put ornaments of twisted threads
 if any man takes a wife and having had connection with her has no delight in her
 and says evil things about her and gives her a bad name saying i took this woman and when i had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin
 then let the girls father and mother put before the responsible men of the town in the public place signs that the girl was a virgin
 and let the girls father say to the responsible men i gave my daughter to this man for his wife but he has no love for her
 and now he has put shame on her saying that she is not a virgin but here is the sign that she is a virgin then they are to put her clothing before the responsible men of the town
 then the responsible men of the town are to give the man his punishment
 they will take from him a hundred shekels of silver which are to be given to the father of the girl because he has given an evil name to a virgin of israel she will go on being his wife he may never put her away all his life
 but if what he has said is true and she is seen to be not a virgin
 then they are to make the girl come to the door of her fathers house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town because she has done evil and put shame on israel by acting as a loose woman in her fathers house so you are to put away evil from among you
