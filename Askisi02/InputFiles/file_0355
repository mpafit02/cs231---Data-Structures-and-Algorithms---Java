 and there was no more war till the thirty fifth year of the rule of asa
 in the thirty sixth year of the rule of asa baasha king of israel went up against judah building ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to asa king of judah
 then asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the lords house and of the kings store house and sent to ben hadad king of aram at damascus saying
 let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see i have sent you silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with baasha king of israel so that he may give up attacking me
 and ben hadad did as king asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of israel attacking ijon and dan and abel maim and all the store towns of naphtali
 then baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of ramah and let his work come to an end
 then king asa with all judah took away the stones and wood with which baasha was building ramah and he made use of them for building geba and mizpah
 at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said to him because you have put your faith in the king of aram and not in the lord your god the army of the king of aram has got away out of your hands
 were not the ethiopians and the lubim a very great army with war carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered but because your faith was in the lord he gave them up into your hands
 for the eyes of the lord go this way and that through all the earth letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him in this you have done foolishly for from now you will have wars
 then asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison burning with wrath against him because of this thing and at the same time asa was cruel to some of the people
 now the acts of asa first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 in the thirty ninth year of his rule asa had a very bad disease of the feet but he did not go to the lord for help in his disease but to medical men
 so asa went to rest with his fathers and death came to him in the forty first year of his rule
 and they put him into the resting place which he had made for himself in the town of david in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices made by the perfumers art and they made a great burning for him
 and jehoshaphat his son became king in his place and made himself strong against israel
 he put forces in all the walled towns of judah and responsible chiefs in the land of judah and in the towns of ephraim which asa his father had taken
 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he went in the early ways of his father not turning to the baals
 but turning to the god of his father and keeping his laws and not doing as israel did
 so the lord made his kingdom strong and all judah gave offerings to jehoshaphat and he had great wealth and honour
 his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of judah
 in the third year of his rule he sent benhail and obadiah and zechariah and nethanel and micaiah his captains as teachers into the towns of judah
 and with them shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tob adonijah the levites and elishama and jehoram the priests
 and they gave teaching in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them they went through all the towns of judah teaching the people
 and the fear of the lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round judah so that they made no wars against jehoshaphat
 and some of the philistines took offerings to jehoshaphat and made him payments of silver and the arabians gave him flocks seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred he goats
 jehoshaphat became greater and greater and made strong towers and store towns in judah
 he had much property in the towns of judah he had forces of armed men great and strong in jerusalem
 this is the number of them listed by their families the captains of thousands of judah adnah the captain and with him three hundred thousand men of war
 second to him jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and eighty thousand
