 and the old man said peace be with you let all your needs be my care only do not take your rest in the street
 so he took them into his house and gave the asses food and after washing their feet they took food and drink
 while they were taking their pleasure at the meal the good for nothing men of the town came round the house giving blows on the door and they said to the old man the master of the house send out that man who came to your house so that we may take our pleasure with him
 so the man the master of the house went out to them and said no my brothers do not this evil thing this man has come into my house and you are not to do him this wrong
 see here is my daughter a virgin and his servant wife i will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will but do no such thing of shame to this man
 but the men would not give ear to him so the man took his woman and sent her out to them and they took her by force using her for their pleasure all night till the morning and when dawn came they let her go
 then at the dawn of day the woman came and falling down at the door of the mans house where her master was was stretched there till it was light
 in the morning her master got up and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way and he saw his servant wife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step
 and he said to her get up and let us be going but there was no answer so he took her up and put her on the ass and went on his way and came to his house
 and when he had come to his house he got his knife and took the woman cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts which he sent through all israel
 and he gave orders to the men whom he sent saying this is what you are to say to all the men of israel has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of israel came out of egypt to this day give thought to it turning it over in your minds and give your opinion of it
 now the angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and he said *** i took you out of egypt guiding you into the land which i gave by an oath to your fathers and i said my agreement with you will never be broken by me
 and you are to make no agreement with the people of this land you are to see that their altars are broken down but you have not given ear to my voice what have you done
 and so i have said i will not send them out from before you but they will be a danger to you and their gods will be a cause of falling to you
 now on hearing these words which the angel of the lord said to all the children of israel the people gave themselves up to loud crying and weeping
 and they gave that place the name of bochim and made offerings there to the lord
 and joshua let the people go away and the children of israel went every man to his heritage to take the land for themselves
 and the people were true to the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of joshua and had seen all the great work of the lord which he had done for israel
 and death came to joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord he being a hundred and ten years old
 and they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in timnath heres in the hill country of ephraim to the north of mount gaash
 and in time death overtook all that generation and another generation came after them having no knowledge of the lord or of the things which he had done for israel
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and became servants to the baals
 and they gave up the lord the god of their fathers who had taken them out of the land of egypt and went after other gods the gods of the peoples round about them worshipping them and moving the lord to wrath
 and they gave up the lord and became the servants of baal and the astartes
 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of those who violently took their property and into the hands of their haters all round them so that they were forced to give way before them
 wherever they went out the hand of the lord was against them for evil as the lord had taken his oath it would be and things became very hard for them
 then the lord gave them judges as their saviours from the hands of those who were cruel to them
 but still they would not give ear to their judges but went after other gods and gave them worship quickly turning from the way in which their fathers had gone keeping the orders of the lord but they did not do so
 and whenever the lord gave them judges then the lord was with the judge and was their saviour from the hands of their haters all the days of the judge for the lord was moved by their cries of grief because of those who were cruel to them
 but whenever the judge was dead they went back and did more evil than their fathers going after other gods to be their servants and their worshippers giving up nothing of their sins and their hard hearted ways
