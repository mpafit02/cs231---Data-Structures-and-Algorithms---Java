 what am i to say seeing that it is he who has done it all my time of sleeping i am turning from side to side without rest
 o lord for this cause i am waiting for you give rest to my spirit make me well again and let me come back to life
 see in place of peace my soul had bitter sorrow but you have kept back my soul from the underworld for you have put all my sins out of your memory
 for the underworld is not able to give you praise death gives you no honour for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy
 the living the living man he will give you praise as i do this day the father will give the story of your mercy to his children
 o lord quickly be my saviour so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the lord
 and isaiah said let them take a cake of figs and put it on the diseased place and he will get well
 and hezekiah said what is the sign that i will go up to the house of the lord
 at that time merodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters with an offering to hezekiah because he had news that hezekiah had been ill and was well again
 and hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil and all the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which he did not let them see
 then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and said to him what did these men say and where did they come from and hezekiah said they came from a far country even from babylon
 and he said what have they seen in your house and hezekiah said in answer they saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which i did not let them see
 then said isaiah to hezekiah give ear to the word of the lord of armies
 truly the days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to babylon all will be gone
 and your sons even your offspring will they take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of babylon
 then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which you have said and he said in his heart there will be peace and quiet in my days
 and in that day seven women will put their hands on one man saying there will be no need for you to give us food or clothing only let us go under your name so that our shame may be taken away
 in that day will the young growth of the lord be beautiful in glory and the fruit of the earth will be the pride of those who are still living in israel
 and it will come about that the rest of the living in zion and of those who have been kept from destruction in jerusalem will be named holy even everyone who has been recorded for life in jerusalem
 when zion has been washed from her sin by the lord and jerusalem made clean from her blood by a judging and a burning wind
 and over every living place on mount zion all over all her meetings the lord will make a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory of the lord will be a cover and a tent
 and a shade in the daytime from the heat and a safe cover from storm and from rain
 give comfort give comfort to my people says your god
 say kind words to the heart of jerusalem crying out to her that her time of trouble is ended that her punishment is complete that she has been rewarded by the lords hand twice over for all her sins
 a voice of one crying make ready in the waste land the way of the lord make level in the lowland a highway for our god
 let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low and let the rough places become level and the hilltops become a valley
 and the glory of the lord will be made clear and all flesh will see it together for the mouth of the lord has said it
 a voice of one saying give a cry  and i said what is my cry to be all flesh is grass and all its strength like the flower of the field
 the grass becomes dry the flower is dead because the breath of the lord goes over it truly the people is grass
 the grass is dry the flower is dead but the word of our god is eternal
