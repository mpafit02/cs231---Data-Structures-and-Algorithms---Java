 and they will be named the holy people those whose cause has been taken up by the lord and you will be named desired a town not given up
 who is this who comes from edom with blood red robes from bozrah he whose clothing is fair stepping with pride in his great strength i whose glory is in the right strong for salvation
 why is your clothing red and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes
 i have been crushing the grapes by myself and of the peoples there was no man with me in my wrath and in my passion they were crushed under my feet and my robes are marked with their life blood and all my clothing is red
 for the day of punishment is in my heart and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come
 and i saw that there was no helper and i was wondering that no one gave them support so my arm did the work of salvation and my wrath was my support
 and in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet and broken in my wrath and i put down their strength to the earth
 i will give news of the mercies of the lord and his great acts even all the things the lord has done for us in his great grace to the house of israel even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies
 for he said truly they are my people children who will not be false so he was their saviour out of all their trouble
 it was no sent one or angel but he himself who was their saviour in his love and in his pity he took up their cause and he took them in his arms caring for them all through the years
 but they went against him causing grief to his holy spirit so he was turned against them and made war on them
 then the early days came to their minds the days of moses his servant and they said where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea where is he who put his holy spirit among them
 he who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of moses by whom the waters were parted before them to make himself an eternal name
 he who made them go through the deep waters like a horse in the waste land
 like the cattle which go down into the valley they went without falling the spirit of the lord guiding them so you went before your people to make yourself a great name
 let your eyes be looking down from heaven from your holy and beautiful house where is your deep feeling the working of your power do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies
 for you are our father though abraham has no knowledge of us and israel gives no thought to us you o lord are our father from the earliest days you have taken up our cause
 o lord why do you send us wandering from your ways making our hearts hard so that we have no fear of you come back because of your servants the tribes of your heritage
 why have evil men gone over your holy place so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters
 we have become as those who were never ruled by you on whom your name was not named
 o let the heavens be broken open and come down so that the mountains may be shaking before you 
 as when fire puts the brushwood in flames or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire to make your name feared by your haters so that the nations may be shaking before you
 while you do acts of power for which we are not looking and which have not come to the ears of men in the past
 the ear has not had news of or the eye seen  any god but you working for the man who is waiting for him
 will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness even on those who keep in mind your ways truly you were angry and we went on doing evil and sinning against you in the past
 for we have all become like an unclean person and all our good acts are like a dirty robe and we have all become old like a dead leaf and our sins like the wind take us away
 and there is no one who makes prayer to your name or who is moved to keep true to you for your face is veiled from us and you have given us into the power of our sins
 but now o lord you are our father we are the earth and you are our maker and we are all the work of your hand
 be not very angry o lord and do not keep our sins in mind for ever give ear to our prayer for we are all your people
 your holy towns have become a waste zion has become a waste jerusalem is a mass of broken walls
