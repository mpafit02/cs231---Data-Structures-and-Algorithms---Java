 and she said to him my lord you took an oath by the lord your god and gave your word to your servant saying truly solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
 and now see adonijah has made himself king without my lords knowledge
 and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the army but he has not sent for solomon your servant
 and now my lord the king the eyes of all israel are on you waiting for you to say who is to take the place of my lord the king after him
 for as things are it will come about when my lord the king is sleeping with his fathers that i and solomon my son will be made outlaws
 and while she was still talking with the king nathan the prophet came in
 and they said to the king here is nathan the prophet and when he came in before the king he went down on his face on the earth
 and nathan said o my lord king have you said adonijah is to be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
 because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the kings sons to come to him with the captains of the army and abiathar the priest and they are feasting before him and crying long life to king adonijah 
 but me your servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and your servant solomon he has not sent for
 has this thing been done by my lord the king without giving word to your servants who was to be placed on my lord the kings seat after him
 then king david in answer said send for bath sheba to come to me and she came in and took her place before the king
 and the king took an oath and said by the living lord who has been my saviour from all my troubles
 as i took an oath to you by the lord the god of israel saying certainly solomon your son will become king after me seated on my seat in my place so will i do this day
 then bath sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour and said may my lord king david go on living for ever
 and king david said send for zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king
 and the king said to them take with you the servants of your lord and put solomon my son on my beast yes mine and take him down to gihon
 and there let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him to make him king over israel and sounding the horn say long life to king solomon 
 then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom for he is to be king in my place and i have given orders that he is to be ruler over israel and over judah
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answering the king said so be it and may the lord the god of my lord the king say so
 as the lord has been with my lord the king even so may he be with solomon and make the seat of his authority greater than that of my lord king david
 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and put solomon on king davids beast and took him to gihon
 and zadok the priest took the vessel of oil out of the tent and put the holy oil on solomon and when the horn was sounded all the people said long life to king solomon 
 and all the people came up after him piping with pipes and they were glad with great joy so that the earth was shaking with the sound
 and it came to the ears of adonijah and all the guests who were with him when their meal was ended and joab hearing the sound of the horn said what is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up
 and while the words were on his lips jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said come in for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good
 and jonathan answering said to adonijah not so but our lord king david has made solomon king
 and he sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they put him on the kings beast
 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him and made him king in gihon and they came back from there with joy and the town was all worked up this is the noise which has come to your ears
 and now solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom
