 so i was like a man whose ears are shut and in whose mouth there are no sharp words
 in you o lord is my hope you will give me an answer o lord my god
 i said let them not be glad over me when my foot is moved let them not be lifted up with pride against me
 my feet are near to falling and my sorrow is ever before me
 i will make clear my wrongdoing with sorrow in my heart for my sin
 but they are strong who have hate for me without cause those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers
 they give me back evil for good they are my haters because i go after the thing which is right
 do not give me up o lord o my god be near to me
 come quickly to give me help o lord my salvation
 &ltto the chief music maker of jeduthun a psalm of david&gt i said i will give attention to my ways so that my tongue may do no wrong i will keep my mouth under control while the sinner is before me
 i made no sound i said no word even of good and i was moved with sorrow
 my heart was burning in my breast while i was deep in thought the fire was lighted then i said with my tongue
 lord give me knowledge of my end and of the measure of my days so that i may see how feeble i am
 you have made my days no longer than a hands measure and my years are nothing in your eyes truly every man is but a breath  selah 
 truly every man goes on his way like an image he is troubled for no purpose he makes a great store of wealth and has no knowledge of who will get it
 and now lord what am i waiting for my hope is in you
 make me free from all my sins do not let me be shamed by the man of evil behaviour
 i was quiet and kept my mouth shut because you had done it
 no longer let your hand be hard on me i am wasted by the blows of your hand
 by the weight of your wrath against mans sin the glory of his form is wasted away truly every man is but a breath  selah 
 let my prayer come to your ears o lord and give attention to my cry make an answer to my weeping for my time here is short before you and in a little time i will be gone like all my fathers
 let your wrath be turned away from me so that i may be comforted before i go away from here and become nothing
 &ltto the chief music maker on corded instruments a psalm of david&gt give answer to my cry o god of my righteousness make me free from my troubles have mercy on me and give ear to my prayer
 o you sons of men how long will you go on turning my glory into shame how long will you give your love to foolish things going after what is false  selah 
 see how the lord has made great his mercy for me the lord will give ear to my cry
 let there be fear in your hearts and do no sin have bitter feelings on your bed but make no sound  selah 
 give the offerings of righteousness and put your faith in the lord
 there are numbers who say who will do us any good the light of his face has gone from us
 lord you have put joy in my heart more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased
 i will take my rest on my bed in peace because you only lord keep me safe
