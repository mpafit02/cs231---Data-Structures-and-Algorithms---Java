 i will say o my god take me not away before my time your years go on through all generations
 in the past you put the earth on its base and the heavens are the work of your hands
 they will come to an end but you will still go on they all will become old like a coat and like a robe they will be changed
 but you are the unchanging one and your years will have no end
 the children of your servants will have a safe resting place and their seed will be ever before you
 &ltof david&gt give praise to the lord o my soul let everything in me give praise to his holy name
 give praise to the lord o my soul let not all his blessings go from your memory
 he has forgiveness for all your sins he takes away all your diseases
 he keeps back your life from destruction crowning you with mercy and grace
 he makes your mouth full of good things so that your strength is made new again like the eagles
 the lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble
 he gave knowledge of his way to moses and made his acts clear to the children of israel
 the lord is kind and full of pity not quickly made angry but ever ready to have mercy
 his feeling will no longer be bitter he will not keep his wrath for ever
 he has not given us the punishment for our sins or the reward of our wrongdoing
 for as the heaven is high over the earth so great is his mercy to his worshippers
 as far as the east is from the west so far has he put our sins from us
 as a father has pity on his children so the lord has pity on his worshippers
 for he has knowledge of our feeble frame he sees that we are only dust
 as for man his days are as grass his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field
 the wind goes over it and it is gone and its place sees it no longer
 but the mercy of the lord is eternal for his worshippers and their childrens children will see his righteousness
 if they keep his agreement and have his laws in mind to do them
 the lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens his kingdom is ruling over all
 give praise to the lord you his angels who are great in strength doing his orders and waiting for his voice
 give praise to the lord all you his armies and you his servants who do his pleasure
 give praise to the lord all his works in all places under his rule give praise to the lord o my soul
 give praise to the lord o my soul o lord my god you are very great you are robed with honour and power
 you are clothed with light as with a robe stretching out the heavens like a curtain
 the arch of your house is based on the waters you make the clouds your carriage you go on the wings of the wind
