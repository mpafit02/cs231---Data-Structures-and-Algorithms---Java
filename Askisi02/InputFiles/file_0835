 and if there is only a short time he will take account of it with his master and in relation to the number of years he will give back the price of making him free
 and he will be with him as a servant working for payment year by year his master is not to be cruel to him before your eyes
 and if he is not made free in this way he will go out in the year of jubilee he and his children with him
 for the children of israel are servants to me they are my servants whom i took out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
 do not make images of false gods or put up an image cut in stone or a pillar or any pictured stone in your land to give worship to it for i am the lord your god
 keep my sabbaths and give honour to my holy place i am the lord
 if you are guided by my rules and keep my laws and do them
 then i will give you rain at the right time and the land will give her increase and the trees of the field will give their fruit
 and the crushing of the grain will overtake the cutting of the grapes and the cutting of the grapes will overtake the planting of the seed and there will be bread in full measure and you will be living in your land safely
 and i will give you peace in the land and you will take your rest and no one will give you cause for fear and i will put an end to all evil beasts in the land and no sword of war will go through your land
 and you will put to flight those who are against you and they will be put to death by your swords
 then five of you will put to flight a hundred and a hundred of you will put to flight ten thousand and all who are against you will be put to death by your swords
 and i will have pleasure in you and make you fertile and greater in number and i will keep my agreement with you
 and old stores long kept will be your food and you will take out the old because of the new
 and i will put my holy house among you and my soul will not be turned away from you in disgust
 and i will be present among you and will be your god and you will be my people
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt so that you might not be servants to them by me the cords of your yoke were broken and i made you go upright
 but if you do not give ear to me and do not keep all these my laws
 and if you go against my rules and if you have hate in your souls for my decisions and you do not do all my orders but go against my agreement
 this will i do to you i will put fear in your hearts even wasting disease and burning pain drying up the eyes and making the soul feeble and you will get no profit from your seed for your haters will take it for food
 and my face will be turned from you and you will be broken before those who are against you and your haters will become your rulers and you will go in flight when no man comes after you
 and if even after these things you will not give ear to me then i will send you punishment seven times more for your sins
 and the pride of your strength will be broken and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass
 and your strength will be used up without profit for your land will not give her increase and the trees of the field will not give their fruit
 and if you still go against me and will not give ear to me i will put seven times more punishments on you because of your sins
 i will let loose the beasts of the field among you and they will take away your children and send destruction on your cattle so that your numbers will become small and your roads become waste
 and if by these things you will not be turned to me but still go against me
 then i will go against you and i will give you punishment i myself seven times for all your sins
 and i will send a sword on you to give effect to the punishment of my agreement and when you come together into your towns i will send disease among you and you will be given up into the hands of your haters
 when i take away your bread of life ten women will be cooking bread in one oven and your bread will be measured out by weight you will have food but never enough
