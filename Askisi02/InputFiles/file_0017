 and have a high opinion of them in love because of their work be at peace among yourselves
 and our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered giving comfort to the feeble hearted supporting those with little strength and putting up with much from all
 let no one give evil for evil but ever go after what is good for one another and for all
 have joy at all times
 keep on with your prayers
 in everything give praise for this is the purpose of god in christ jesus for you
 do not put out the light of the spirit
 do not make little of the words of the prophets
 let all things be tested keep to what is good
 keep from every form of evil
 and may the god of peace himself make you holy in every way and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our lord jesus christ
 god by whom you have been marked out in his purpose is unchanging and will make it complete
 brothers keep us in mind in your prayers
 give all the brothers a holy kiss
 i give orders in the name of the lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the order of god our saviour and christ jesus our hope
 to timothy my true child in the faith grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
 it was my desire when i went on into macedonia that you might make a stop at ephesus to give orders to certain men not to put forward a different teaching
 or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations from which come questionings and doubts in place of gods ordered way of life which is in faith
 but the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart and a knowledge of what is right and true faith
 from which some have been turned away giving themselves to foolish talking
 desiring to be teachers of the law though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly
 we are conscious that the law is good if a man makes a right use of it
 with the knowledge that the law is made not for the upright man but for those who have no respect for law and order for evil men and sinners for the unholy and those who have no religion for those who put their fathers or mothers to death for takers of life
 for those who go after loose women for those with unnatural desires for those who take men prisoners who make false statements and false oaths and those who do any other things against the right teaching
 which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great god which was given into my care
 i give praise to him who gave me power christ jesus our lord because he took me to be true making me his servant
 though i had said violent words against god and done cruel acts causing great trouble but i was given mercy because i did it without knowledge not having faith
 and the grace of our lord was very great with faith and love which is in christ jesus
