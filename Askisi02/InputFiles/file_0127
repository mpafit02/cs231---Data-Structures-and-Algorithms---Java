 so they took them up twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough
 and when the people saw the sign which he had done they said truly this is the prophet who is to come into the world
 now when jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king he went away again up the mountain by himself
 when evening came the disciples went down to the sea
 and they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of capernaum by then it was dark and still jesus had not come to them
 the sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing
 after they had gone three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat and they had great fear
 but he said to them it is i have no fear
 then they readily took him into the boat and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going
 the day after the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there that jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples but that the disciples had gone away by themselves
 some other boats however came from tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the lord had given praise
 so when the people saw that jesus was not there or his disciples they got into those boats and went over to capernaum looking for jesus
 and when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said rabbi when did you come here
 jesus answering them said truly i say to you you come after me not because you saw signs but because you were given the bread and had enough
 let your work not be for the food which comes to an end but for the food which goes on for eternal life which the son of man will give to you for on him has god the father put his mark
 then they said to him how may we do the works of god
 jesus answering said to them this is to do the work of god to have faith in him whom god has sent
 so they said what sign do you give us so that we may see and have faith in you what do you do
 our fathers had the manna in the waste land as the writings say he gave them bread from heaven
 jesus then said to them truly i say to you what moses gave you was not the bread from heaven it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven
 the bread of god is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world
 ah lord they said give us that bread for ever 
 and this was the answer of jesus i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never be in need of food and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink
 but it is as i said to you you have seen me and still you have no faith
 whatever the father gives to me will come to me and i will not send away anyone who comes to me
 for i have come down from heaven not to do my pleasure but the pleasure of him who sent me
 and this is the pleasure of him who sent me that i am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me but i am to give it new life on the last day
 this i say is my fathers pleasure that everyone who sees the son and has faith in him may have eternal life and i will take him up on the last day
 now the jews said bitter things about jesus because of his words i am the bread which came down from heaven
 and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we have seen how is it then that he now says i have come down from heaven
