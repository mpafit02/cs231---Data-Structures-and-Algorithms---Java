 then gideon the son of joash went back from the fight
 and taking prisoner a young man of the people of succoth he got from him in answer to his questions a list of the chiefs of succoth and the responsible men seventy seven men
 so he came to the men of succoth and said here are zebah and zalmunna on account of whom you made sport of me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness
 then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems
 and he had the tower of penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death
 then he said to zebah and zalmunna where are the men whom you put to death at tabor and they gave answer as you are so were they every one of them was like a kings son
 and he said they were my brothers my mothers sons by the life of the lord if you had kept them safe i would not put you to death
 then he said to jether his oldest son up  put them to death but the boy did not take out his sword fearing because he was still a boy
 then zebah and zalmunna said up  put an end to us yourself for you have a mans strength then gideon got up and put zebah and zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels necks
 then the men of israel said to gideon be our ruler you and your son and your sons son after him for you have been our saviour from the hands of midian
 but gideon said to them i will not be a ruler over you and my son will not be a ruler over you it is the lord who will be ruler over you
 then gideon said to them i have a request to make to you let every man give me the ear rings he has taken  for they had gold ear rings because they were ishmaelites 
 and they gave answer we will gladly give them so they put down a robe every man dropping into it the ear rings he had taken
 the weight of the gold ear rings which he got from them was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold in addition to the moon ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of midian and the chains on their camels necks
 and gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town ophrah and all israel went after it there and were false to the lord and it became a cause of sin to gideon and his house
 so midian was broken before the children of israel and the midianites never got back their strength and the land had peace for forty years in the days of gideon
 and jerubbaal the son of joash went back to his house and was living there
 gideon had seventy sons the offspring of his body for he had a number of wives
 and the servant wife he had in shechem had a son by him to whom he gave the name abimelech
 and gideon the son of joash came to his end when he was very old and his body was put in the resting place of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites
 and after the death of gideon the children of israel again went after the gods of canaan and were false to the lord and made baal berith their god
 and the children of israel did not keep in their minds the lord their god who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side
 and they were not kind to the house of jerubbaal that is gideon in reward for all the good he had done to israel
 now abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem to his mothers family and said to them and to all the family of his mothers father
 say now in the ears of all the townsmen of shechem is it better for you to be ruled by all the seventy sons of jerubbaal or by one man only and keep in mind that i am your bone and your flesh
 so his mothers family said all this about him in the ears of all the townsmen of shechem and their hearts were turned to abimelech for they said he is our brother
 and they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of baal berith with which abimelech got the support of a number of uncontrolled and good for nothing persons
 then he went to his fathers house at ophrah and put his brothers the seventy sons of jerubbaal to death on the same stone however jotham the youngest kept himself safe by going away to a secret place
 and all the townsmen of shechem and all beth millo came together and went and made abimelech their king by the oak of the pillar in shechem
 now jotham on hearing of it went to the top of mount gerizim and crying out with a loud voice said to them give ear to me you townsmen of shechem so that god may give ear to you
