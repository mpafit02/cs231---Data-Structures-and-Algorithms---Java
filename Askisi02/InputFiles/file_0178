 then they sent to him certain of the pharisees and the herodians so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick
 and when they had come they said to him master we are certain that you are true and have no fear of anyone you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of god is it right to give taxes to caesar or not
 are we to give or not to give but he conscious of their false hearts said to them why do you put me to the test give me a penny so that i may see it
 and they gave him one and he said to them whose is this image and name on it and they said to him caesars
 and jesus said to them give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods and they were full of wonder at him
 and there came to him sadducees who say there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying
 master in the law moses says if a mans brother comes to his end and has a wife still living and no child it is right for his brother to take his wife and get a family for his brother
 there were seven brothers and the first took a wife and at his death there were no offspring
 and the second took her and at his death there were no offspring and the third the same
 and all the seven had no seed last of all the woman herself came to her death
 in the future life when they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for the seven had her for a wife
 jesus said to them is not this the reason for your error that you have no knowledge of the holy writings or of the power of god
 when they come back from the dead they do not get married but are like the angels in heaven
 but as to the dead coming back to life have you not seen in the book of moses about the burning thorn tree how god said to him i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
 he is not the god of the dead but of the living you are greatly in error
 and one of the scribes came and hearing their argument together and seeing that he had given them a good answer put the question to him which law is the first of all
 jesus said in answer the first is give ear o israel the lord our god is one lord
 and you are to have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
 the second is this have love for your neighbour as for yourself there is no other law greater than these
 and the scribe said to him truly master you have well said that he is one and there is no other but he
 and to have love for him with all the heart and with all the mind and with all the strength and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself is much more than all forms of offerings
 and when jesus saw that he gave a wise answer he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god and every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more
 and jesus when he was teaching in the temple said how do the scribes say that the christ is the son of david
 david himself said in the holy spirit the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put those who are against you under your feet
 david himself gives him the name of lord and how then is he his son and the common people gave ear to him gladly
 and in his teaching he said be on your watch against the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the market places
 and to have the chief seats in the synagogues and the first places at feasts
 who take away the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers these will be judged more hardly
 and he took a seat by the place where the money was kept and saw how the people put money into the boxes and a number who had wealth put in much
 and there came a poor widow and she put in two little bits of money which make a farthing
