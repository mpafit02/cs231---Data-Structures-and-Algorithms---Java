 and when he saw her he was overcome with grief and said ah  my daughter  i am crushed with sorrow and it is you who are the chief cause of my trouble for i have made an oath to the lord and i may not take it back
 and she said to him my father you have made an oath to the lord do then to me whatever you have said for the lord has sent a full reward on your haters on the children of ammon
 then she said to her father only do this for me let me have two months to go away into the mountains with my friends weeping for my sad fate
 and he said go then so he sent her away for two months and she went with her friends to the mountains weeping for her sad fate
 and at the end of two months she went back to her father who did with her as he had said in his oath and she had never been touched by a man so it became a rule in israel
 for the women to go year by year sorrowing for the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in every year
 now the men of ephraim came together and took up arms and went over to zaphon and they said to jephthah why did you go over to make war against the children of ammon without sending for us to go with you now we will put your house on fire over you
 and jephthah said to them i and my people were in danger and the children of ammon were very cruel to us and when i sent for you you gave me no help against them
 so when i saw that there was no help to be had from you i put my life in my hand and went over against the children of ammon and the lord gave them into my hands why then have you come up to me this day to make war on me
 then jephthah got together all the men of gilead and made war on ephraim and the men of gilead overcame ephraim
 and the gileadites took the crossing places of jordan against the ephraimites and when any of the men of ephraim who had gone in flight said let me go over the men of gilead said to him are you an ephraimite and if he said no
 then they said to him now say shibboleth and he said sibboleth and was not able to say it in the right way then they took him and put him to death at the crossing places of jordan and at that time forty two thousand ephraimites were put to death
 now jephthah was judge of israel for six years and jephthah the gileadite came to his death and his body was put to rest in his town mizpeh of gilead
 and after him ibzan of beth lehem was judge of israel
 he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent to other places and he got thirty wives from other places for his sons and he was judge of israel for seven years
 and ibzan came to his death and his body was put to rest at beth lehem
 and after him elon the zebulonite was judge of israel and he was judge of israel for ten years
 and elon the zebulonite came to his death and his body was put to rest in aijalon in the land of zebulun
 and after him abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite was judge of israel
 he had forty sons and thirty sons sons who went on seventy young asses and he was judge of israel for eight years
 and abdon the son of hillel came to his death and his body was put to rest in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the hill country of the amalekites
 and the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord gave them into the hands of the philistines for forty years
 now there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites and his name was manoah and his wife had never given birth to a child
 and the angel of the lord came to the woman and said to her see now  though you have never given birth to children you will be with child and give birth to a son
 now then take care to have no wine or strong drink and to take no unclean thing for food
 for you are with child and will give birth to a son his hair is never to be cut for the child is to be separate to god from his birth and he will take up the work of freeing israel from the hands of the philistines
 then the woman came in and said to her husband a man came to me and his form was like the form of a god causing great fear i put no question to him about where he came from and he did not give me his name
 but he said to me you are with child and will give birth to a son and now do not take any wine or strong drink or let anything unclean be your food for the child will be separate to god from his birth to the day of his death
 then manoah made prayer to the lord and said o lord let the man of god whom you sent come to us again and make clear to us what we are to do for the child who is to come
 and god gave ear to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came to the woman again when she was seated in the field but her husband manoah was not with her
