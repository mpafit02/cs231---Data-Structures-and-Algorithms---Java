 so they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the kings horses and there she was put to death
 and jehoiada made an agreement between the lord and all the people and the king that they would be the lords people
 then all the people went to the house of baal and had it pulled down and its altars and images broken up and mattan the priest of baal they put to death before the altars
 and jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the lord into the hands of the priests and the levites who had been grouped in divisions by david to make burned offerings to the lord as it is recorded in the law of moses with joy and song as david had said
 and he put door keepers at the doors of the lords house to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in
 then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the lord through the higher doorway into the kings house and put the king on the seat of the kingdom
 so all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet for they had put athaliah to death with the sword
 joash was seven years old when he became king and he was ruling for forty years in jerusalem his mothers name was zibiah of beer sheba
 and joash did what was right in the eyes of the lord as long as jehoiada the priest was living
 and jehoiada took two wives for him and he became the father of sons and daughters
 now after this joash had a desire to put the house of the lord into good order again
 and getting together the priests and levites he said to them go out into the towns of judah year by year and get from all israel money to keep the house of your god in good condition and see that this is done without loss of time the levites however were slow in doing so
 then the king sent for jehoiada the chief priest and said to him why have you not given the levites orders that the tax fixed by moses the servant of the lord and by the meeting of israel for the tent of witness is to be got in from judah and jerusalem and handed over
 for the house of the lord had been broken up by athaliah that evil woman and her sons and all its holy things they had given to the baals
 so at the kings order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the lord
 and an order was sent out through all judah and jerusalem that payment was to be made to the lord of the tax which moses the servant of god had put on israel in the waste land
 and all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest till they had all given
 so when the chest was taken to the kings servants by the levites and they saw that there was much money in it the kings scribe and the chief priests servant took the money out and put the chest back in its place they did this day by day and got together a great amount of money
 then the king and jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the lords house and with it they got wall builders and woodworkers and metal workers to put the house of the lord in good order again
 so the workmen did their work making good what was damaged and building up the house of god till it was strong and beautiful again
 and when the work was done they took the rest of the money to the king and jehoiada and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the lord all the vessels needed for the offerings the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver and as long as jehoiada was living the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the lord
 but jehoiada became old and full of days and he came to his end he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death
 and they put him into his last resting place in the town of david among the kings because he had done good in israel for god and for his house
 now after the death of jehoiada the chiefs of judah came and went down on their faces before the king then the king gave ear to them
 and they gave up the house of the lord god of their fathers and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images and because of this sin of theirs wrath came on judah and jerusalem
 and the lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him and they gave witness against them but they would not give ear
 then the spirit of god came on zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest and getting up before the people he said to them god has said why do you go against the orders of the lord so that everything goes badly for you because you have given up the lord he has given you up
 but when they had made a secret design against him he was stoned with stones by the kings order in the outer square of the lords house
 so king joash did not keep in mind how good jehoiada his father had been to him but put his son to death and in the hour of his death he said may the lord see it and take payment 
 now in the spring the army of the aramaeans came up against him they came against judah and jerusalem putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of damascus
