 and they put it to the decision of chance and the decision was given for matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
 now there was a certain man in caesarea named cornelius the captain of the italian band of the army
 a serious minded man fearing god with all his family he gave much money to the poor and made prayer to god at all times
 he saw in a vision clearly at about the ninth hour of the day an angel of the lord coming to him and saying to him cornelius 
 and he looking on him in fear said what is it lord and he said to him your prayers and your offerings have come up to god and he has kept them in mind
 now send men to joppa and get one simon named peter
 who is living with simon a leather worker whose house is by the sea
 and when the angel who said these words to him had gone away he sent for two of his house servants and a god fearing man of the army one of those who were waiting on him at all times
 and having given them an account of everything he sent them to joppa
 now the day after when they were on their journey and were near the town peter went up to the top of the house for prayer about the sixth hour
 and he was in need of food but while they were getting it ready a deep sleep came on him
 and he saw the heavens opening and a vessel coming down like a great cloth let down on the earth
 in which were all sorts of beasts and birds
 and a voice came to him saying come peter take them for food
 but peter said no lord for i have never taken food which is common or unclean
 and the voice came to him a second time what god has made clean do not you make common
 and this was done three times and then the vessel was taken back into heaven
 now while peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision the men who were sent by cornelius having made search for simons house came to the door
 to see if simon named peter was living there
 and while peter was turning the vision over in his mind the spirit said to him see three men are looking for you
 go down then and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them
 and peter went down to the men and said i am the man you are looking for why have you come
 and they said cornelius a captain an upright and god fearing man respected by all the nation of the jews had word from god by an angel to send for you to his house and to give hearing to your words
 so he took them in for the night and the day after he went with them taking some of the brothers from joppa with him
 and the day after that they came to caesarea and cornelius was waiting for them having got together his relations and his near friends
 and when peter came in cornelius came to him and falling down at his feet gave him worship
 but peter lifting him up said get up for i am a man as you are
 and saying these words he went in and saw that a great number of people had come together
 and he said to them you yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation but god has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean
 and so i came without question when i was sent for what then is your purpose in sending for me
