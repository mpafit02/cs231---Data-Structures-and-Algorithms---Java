 so this is what the lord has said because your words are without substance and your visions are false see i am against you says the lord
 and my hand will be against the prophets who see visions without substance and who make false use of secret arts they will not be in the secret of my people and they will not be recorded in the list of the children of israel and they will not come into the land of israel and it will be clear to you that i am the lord
 because even because they have been guiding my people into error saying peace when there is no peace and in the building of a division wall they put whitewash on it
 say to those who put whitewash on it there will be an overflowing shower and you o ice drops will come raining down and it will be broken in two by the storm wind
 and when the wall has come down will they not say to you where is the whitewash which you put on it
 for this reason the lord has said i will have it broken in two by a storm wind in my passion and there will be an overflowing shower in my wrath and you o ice drops will come raining angrily down
 so i will let the wall which you were covering with whitewash be broken down i will have it levelled to the earth so that its base is uncovered it will come down and destruction will come on you with it and it will be clear to you that i am the lord
 so i will let loose my passion on the wall in full measure and on those who put whitewash on it and i will say to you where is the wall and where are those who put whitewash on it
 even the prophets of israel who say words to jerusalem who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace says the lord
 and you son of man let your face be turned against the daughters of your people who are acting the part of prophets at their pleasure be a prophet against them and say
 this is what the lord has said a curse is on the women who are stitching bands on all arms and putting veils on the heads of those of every size so that they may go after souls  will you go after the souls of my people and keep yourselves safe from death
 and you have put me to shame among my people for a little barley and some bits of bread sending death on souls for whom there is no cause of death and keeping those souls living who have no right to life by the false words you say to my people who give ear to what is false
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against your bands with which you go after souls and i will violently take them off their arms and i will let loose the souls even the souls whom you go after freely
 and i will have your veils violently parted in two and will make my people free from your hands and they will no longer be in your power for you to go after them and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because with your false words you have given pain to the heart of the upright man when i had not made him sad in order to make strong the hands of the evil doer so that he may not be turned from his evil way and get life
 for this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts and i will make my people free from your power and you will be certain that i am the lord
 then certain of the responsible men of israel came to me and took their seats before me
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man these men have taken their false gods into their hearts and put before their faces the sin which is the cause of their fall am i to give ear when they come to me for directions
 for this cause say to them these are the words of the lord every man of israel who has taken his false god into his heart and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall and comes to the prophet i the lord will give him an answer by myself in agreement with the number of his false gods
 so as to take the children of israel in the thoughts of their hearts because they have become strange to me through their false gods
 for this cause say to the children of israel these are the words of the lord come back and give up your false gods and let your faces be turned from your disgusting things
 when any one of the men of israel or of those from other lands who are living in israel who has become strange to me and takes his false gods into his heart and puts before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall comes to the prophet to get directions from me i the lord will give him an answer by myself
 and my face will be turned against that man and i will make him a sign and a common saying cutting him off from among my people and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and if the prophet tricked by deceit says anything it is i the lord by whom he has been tricked and i will put out my hand against him and he will be cut off from among my people israel
 and the punishment of their sin will be on them the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of him who goes to him for directions
 so that the children of israel may no longer go wandering away from me or make themselves unclean with all their wrongdoing but they will be my people and i will be their god says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man when a land sinning against me does wrong and my hand is stretched out against it and the support of its bread is broken and i make it short of food cutting off man and beast from it
 even if these three men noah daniel and job were in it only themselves would they keep safe by their righteousness says the lord
