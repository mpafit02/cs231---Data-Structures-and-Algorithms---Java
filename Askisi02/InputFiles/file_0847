 is the lord quickly made angry are these his doings do not his words do good to his people israel
 as for you you have become haters of those who were at peace with you you take the clothing of those who go by without fear and make them prisoners of war
 the women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever
 up  and go for this is not your rest because it has been made unclean the destruction ordered will come on you
 if a man came with a false spirit of deceit saying i will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink he would be the sort of prophet for this people
 i will certainly make all of you o jacob come together i will get together the rest of israel i will put them together like the sheep in their circle like a flock in their green field they will be full of the noise of men
 the opener of the way will go up before them forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it their king will go on before them and the lord at their head
 and i said give ear now you heads of jacob and rulers of the people of israel is it not for you to have knowledge of what is right
 you who are haters of good and lovers of evil pulling off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones
 like meat they take the flesh of my people for their food skinning them and crushing their bones yes cutting them up as if for the pot like flesh inside the cooking pot
 then they will be crying to the lord for help but he will not give them an answer yes he will keep his face veiled from them at that time because their acts have been evil
 this is what the lord has said about the prophets by whom my people have been turned from the right way who biting with their teeth say peace and if anyone puts nothing in their mouths they make ready for war against him
 for this cause it will be night for you without a vision and it will be dark for you without knowledge of the future the sun will go down over the prophets and the day will be black over them
 and the seers will be shamed and the readers of the future will be at a loss all of them covering their lips for there is no answer from god
 but i truly am full of the spirit of the lord with power of judging and with strength to make clear to jacob his wrongdoing and to israel his sin
 then give ear to this you heads of the children of jacob you rulers of the children of israel hating what is right twisting what is straight
 they are building up zion with blood and jerusalem with evil doing
 its heads take rewards for judging and the priests take payment for teaching and the prophets get silver for reading the future but still supporting themselves on the lord they say is not the lord among us no evil will overtake us
 for this reason zion will be ploughed like a field because of you and jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods
 but in the last days it will come about that the mountain of the lords house will be placed on the top of the mountains and be lifted up over the hills and peoples will be flowing to it
 and a number of nations will go and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word for from zion the law will go out and the word of the lord from jerusalem
 and he will be judge between great peoples and strong nations far away will be ruled by his decisions their swords will be hammered into plough blades and their spears into vine knives nations will no longer be lifting up their swords against one another and knowledge of war will have gone for ever
 but every man will be seated under his vine and under his fig tree and no one will be a cause of fear to them for the mouth of the lord of armies has said it
 for all the peoples will be walking every one in the name of his god and we will be walking in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever
 in that day says the lord i will get together her who goes with uncertain steps i will get together her who has been sent away and her on whom i have sent evil
 and i will make her whose steps were uncertain a small band and her who was feeble a strong nation and the lord will be their king in mount zion from now and for ever
 and you o tower of the flock ophel of the daughter of zion to you it will come even the earlier authority the kingdom of the daughter of jerusalem
 now why are you crying so loudly is there no king in you has destruction come on your wise helper so that pains have taken you like the pains of a woman in childbirth
 be in pain make sounds of grief o daughter of zion like a woman in childbirth for now you will go out of the town living in the open country and will come even to babylon there you will have salvation there the lord will make you free from the hands of your haters
 and now a number of nations have come together against you and they say let her be made unclean and let our eyes see the fate of zion
