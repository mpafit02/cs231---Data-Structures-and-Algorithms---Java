 and to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect
 but those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care and so the body has been joined together by god in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it
 so that there might be no division in the body but all the parts might have the same care for one another
 and if there is pain in one part of the body all the parts will be feeling it or if one part is honoured all the parts will be glad
 now you are the body of christ and every one of you the separate parts of it
 and god has put some in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then those with wonder working powers then those with the power of taking away disease helpers wise guides users of strange tongues
 are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers have all the power of working wonders
 are all able to take away disease have all the power of tongues are all able to give their sense
 but let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the spirit and now i am pointing out to you an even better way
 if i make use of the tongues of men and of angels and have not love i am like sounding brass or a loud tongued bell
 and if i have a prophets power and have knowledge of all secret things and if i have all faith by which mountains may be moved from their place but have not love i am nothing
 and if i give all my goods to the poor and if i give my body to be burned but have not love it is of no profit to me
 love is never tired of waiting love is kind love has no envy love has no high opinion of itself love has no pride
 loves ways are ever fair it takes no thought for itself it is not quickly made angry it takes no account of evil
 it takes no pleasure in wrongdoing but has joy in what is true
 love has the power of undergoing all things having faith in all things hoping all things
 though the prophets word may come to an end tongues come to nothing and knowledge have no more value love has no end
 for our knowledge is only in part and the prophets word gives only a part of what is true
 but when that which is complete is come then that which is in part will be no longer necessary
 when i was a child i made use of a childs language i had a childs feelings and a childs thoughts now that i am a man i have put away the things of a child
 for now we see things in a glass darkly but then face to face now my knowledge is in part then it will be complete even as gods knowledge of me
 but now we still have faith hope love these three and the greatest of these is love
 go after love still desiring to have the things which the spirit gives but most of all that you may have the prophets power
 for he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to god because no one has the sense of what he is saying but in the spirit he is talking of secret things
 but the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength
 he who makes use of tongues may do good to himself but he who gives the prophets word does good to the church
 now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophets word from you for this is a greater thing than using tongues if the sense is not given at the same time for the good of the church
 but now my brothers if i come to you using tongues what profit will it be to you if i do not give you a revelation or knowledge or the word of the prophet or teaching
 even things without life having a voice such as a music pipe or other instrument if they do not give out different sounds who may be certain what is being played
 for if the war horn gives out an uncertain note who will get ready for the fight
