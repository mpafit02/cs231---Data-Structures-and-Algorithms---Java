 and the chiefs of the philistines came up to her and said to her make use of your power over him and see what is the secret of his great strength and how we may get the better of him and put bands on him so that we may make him feeble and every one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver
 so delilah said to samson make clear to me now what is the secret of your great strength and how you may be put in bands and made feeble
 and samson said to her if seven new bow cords which have never been made dry are knotted round me i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so the chiefs of the philistines gave her seven new bow cords which had never been made dry and she had them tightly knotted round him
 now she had men waiting secretly in the inner room and she said to him the philistines are on you samson and the cords were broken by him as a twist of thread is broken when touched by a flame so the secret of his strength did not come to light
 then delilah said to samson see you have been making sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands
 and he said to her if they only put round me new thick cords which have never been used then i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so delilah took new thick cords knotting them tightly round him and said to him the philistines are on you samson and men were waiting secretly in the inner room and the cords were broken off his arms like threads
 then delilah said to samson up to now you have made sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands and he said to her if you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so while he was sleeping she got the seven twists of his hair worked into her cloth and fixed with the pin and said to him the philistines are on you samson then awaking from his sleep he got up quickly pulling up cloth and machine together
 and she said to him why do you say you are my lover when your heart is not mine three times you have made sport of me and have not made clear to me the secret of your great strength
 so day after day she gave him no peace for ever questioning him till his soul was troubled to death
 and opening all his heart to her he said to her my head has never been touched by a blade for i have been separate to god from the day of my birth if my hair is cut off then my strength will go from me and i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 and when delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart she sent word to the chiefs of the philistines saying come up this time for he has let out all his heart to me then the chiefs of the philistines came to her with the money in their hands
 and she made him go to sleep on her knees and she sent for a man and had his seven twists of hair cut off and while it was being done he became feeble and his strength went from him
 then she said the philistines are on you samson and awaking from his sleep he said i will go out as at other times shaking myself free but he was not conscious that the lord had gone from him
 so the philistines took him and put out his eyes then they took him down to gaza and chaining him with bands of brass put him to work crushing grain in the prison house
 but the growth of his hair was starting again after it had been cut off
 and the chiefs of the philistines came together to make a great offering to dagon their god and to be glad for they said our god has given into our hands samson our hater
 and when the people saw him they gave praise to their god for they said our god has given into our hands the one who was fighting against us who made our country waste and who put great numbers of us to death
 now when their hearts were full of joy they said send for samson to make sport for us and they sent for samson out of the prison house and he made sport before them and they put him between the pillars
 and samson said to the boy who took him by the hand let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house so that i may put my back against them
 now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and about three thousand men and women were on the roof looking on while samson made sport
 and samson crying out to the lord said o lord god do have me now in mind and do make me strong only this once o god so that i may take one last payment from the philistines for my two eyes
 then samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house putting his weight on them on one with his right hand and on the other with his left
 and samson said let death overtake me with the philistines and he put out all his strength and the house came down on the chiefs and on all the people who were in it so the dead whom he sent to destruction by his death were more than all those on whom he had sent destruction in his life
 then his brothers and his fathers people came down and took him up and put his body to rest in the earth between zorah and eshtaol in the resting place of manoah his father and he had been judge of israel for twenty years
 now there was a man of the hill country of ephraim named micah
 and he said to his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you about which you took an oath and said in my hearing i have given this silver to the lord from my hand for myself to make a pictured image and a metal image see i have the silver for i took it so now i will give it back to you and his mother said may the blessing of the lord be on my son
 and he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother and his mother said i have made the silver holy to the lord from me for my son to make a pictured image and a metal image
