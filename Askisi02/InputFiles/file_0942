 he makes winds his angels and flames of fire his servants
 he has made the earth strong on its bases so that it may not be moved for ever and ever
 covering it with the sea as with a robe the waters were high over the mountains
 at the voice of your word they went in flight at the sound of your thunder they went away in fear
 the mountains came up and the valleys went down into the place which you had made ready for them
 you made a limit over which they might not go so that the earth would never again be covered by them
 you sent the springs into the valleys they are flowing between the hills
 they give drink to every beast of the field the mountain asses come to them for water
 the birds of the air have their resting places by them and make their song among the branches
 he sends down rain from his store houses on the hills the earth is full of the fruit of his works
 he makes the grass come up for the cattle and plants for the use of man so that bread may come out of the earth
 and wine to make glad the heart of man and oil to make his face shining and bread giving strength to his heart
 the trees of the lord are full of growth the cedars of lebanon of his planting
 where the birds have their resting places as for the stork the tall trees are her house
 the high hills are a safe place for the mountain goats and the rocks for the small beasts
 he made the moon for a sign of the divisions of the year teaching the sun the time of its going down
 when you make it dark it is night when all the beasts of the woods come quietly out of their secret places
 the young lions go thundering after their food searching for their meat from god
 the sun comes up and they come together and go back to their secret places to take their rest
 man goes out to his work and to his business till the evening
 o lord how great is the number of your works  in wisdom you have made them all the earth is full of the things you have made
 there is the great wide sea where there are living things great and small more than may be numbered
 there go the ships there is that great beast which you have made as a plaything
 all of them are waiting for you to give them their food in its time
 they take what you give them they are full of the good things which come from your open hand
 if your face is veiled they are troubled when you take away their breath they come to an end and go back to the dust
 if you send out your spirit they are given life you make new the face of the earth
 let the glory of the lord be for ever let the lord have joy in his works
 at whose look the earth is shaking at whose touch the mountains send out smoke
 i will make songs to the lord all my life i will make melody to my god while i have my being
