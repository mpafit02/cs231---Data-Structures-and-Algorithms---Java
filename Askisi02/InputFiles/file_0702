 at that time says the lord i will be the god of all the families of israel and they will be my people
 the lord has said grace came in the waste land to a people kept safe from the sword even to israel on the way to his resting place
 from far away he saw the lord my love for you is an eternal love so with mercy i have made you come with me
 i will again make new your buildings o virgin of israel and you will take up your place again you will take up your instruments of music and go out in the dances of those who are glad
 again will your vine gardens be planted on the hill of samaria the planters will be planting and using the fruit
 for there will be a day when those who get in the grapes on the hills of ephraim will be crying up  let us go up to zion to the lord our god
 for the lord has said make a glad song for jacob and give a cry on the top of the mountains give the news give praise and say the lord has given salvation to his people even to the rest of israel
 see i will take them from the north country and get them from the inmost parts of the earth and with them the blind and the feeble footed the woman with child and her who is in birth pains together a very great army they will come back here
 they will come with weeping and going before them i will be their guide guiding them by streams of water in a straight way where there is no falling for i am a father to israel and ephraim is the first of my sons
 give ear to the word of the lord o you nations and give news of it in the sea lands far away and say he who has sent israel wandering will get him together and will keep him as a keeper does his flock
 for the lord has given a price for jacob and made him free from the hands of him who was stronger than he
 so they will come with songs on the high places flowing together to the good things of the lord to the grain and the wine and the oil to the young ones of the flock and of the herd their souls will be like a watered garden and they will have no more sorrow
 then the virgin will have joy in the dance and the young men and the old will be glad for i will have their weeping turned into joy i will give them comfort and make them glad after their sorrow
 i will give the priests their desired fat things and my people will have a full measure of my good things says the lord
 so has the lord said in ramah there is a sound of crying weeping and bitter sorrow rachel weeping for her children she will not be comforted for their loss
 the lord has said this keep your voice from sorrow and your eyes from weeping for your work will be rewarded says the lord and they will come back from the land of their hater
 and there is hope for the future says the lord and your children will come back to the land which is theirs
 certainly ephraims words of grief have come to my ears you have given me training and i have undergone it like a young cow unused to the yoke let me be turned and come back for you are the lord my god
 truly after i had been turned i had regret for my ways and after i had got knowledge i made signs of sorrow i was put to shame truly i was covered with shame because i had to undergo the shame of my early years
 is ephraim my dear son is he the child of my delight for whenever i say things against him i still keep him in my memory so my heart is troubled for him i will certainly have mercy on him says the lord
 put up guiding pillars make road signs for yourself give attention to the highway even the way in which you went be turned again o virgin of israel be turned to these your towns
 how long will you go on turning this way and that o wandering daughter for the lord has made a new thing on the earth a woman changed into a man
 so the lord of armies the god of israel has said again will these words be used in the land of judah and in its towns when i have let their fate be changed may the blessing of the lord be on you o resting place of righteousness o holy mountain
 and judah and all its towns will be living there together the farmers and those who go about with flocks
 for i have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure
 at this awaking from my sleep i saw and my sleep was sweet to me
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will have israel and judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast
 and it will come about that as i have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble so i will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting says the lord
 in those days they will no longer say the fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are put on edge
 but everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge
