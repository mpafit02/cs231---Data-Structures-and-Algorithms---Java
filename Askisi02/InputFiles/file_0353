 and when he made himself low the wrath of the lord was turned back from him and complete destruction did not come on him for there was still some good in judah
 so king rehoboam made himself strong in jerusalem and was ruling there rehoboam was forty one years old when he became king and he was ruling for seventeen years in jerusalem the town which the lord had made his out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonite woman
 and he did evil because his heart was not true to the lord
 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not recorded in the words of shemaiah the prophet and iddo the seer and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
 and rehoboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david and abijah his son became king in his place
 in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam abijah became king over judah
 he was king in jerusalem for three years his mothers name was maacah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam
 and abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war four hundred thousand of his best men and jeroboam put his forces in line against him eight hundred thousand of his best men of war
 and abijah took up his position on mount zemaraim in the hill country of ephraim and said give ear to me o jeroboam and all israel
 is it not clear to you that the lord the god of israel gave the rule over israel to david and to his sons for ever by an agreement made with salt
 but jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david took up arms against his lord
 and certain foolish and good for nothing men were joined with him and made themselves strong against rehoboam the son of solomon when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back
 and now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the lord has put into the hands of the sons of david and you are a very great number and you have with you the gold oxen which jeroboam made to be your gods
 and after driving out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep may be a priest of those who are no gods
 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not been turned away from him we have priests who do the work of the lord even the sons of aaron and the levites in their places
 by whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the lord every morning and every evening and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening for we keep the orders given to us by the lord our god but you have gone away from him
 and now god is with us at our head and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you o children of israel do not make war on the lord the god of your fathers for it will not go well for you
 but jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back so some were facing judah and others were stationed secretly at their back
 and judah turning their faces saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back and they gave a cry for help to the lord while the priests were sounding their horns
 and the men of judah gave a loud cry and at their cry god put fear into jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah
 and the children of israel went in flight before judah and god gave them up into their hands
 and abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction five hundred thousand of the best of israel were put to the sword
 so at that time the children of israel were overcome and the children of judah got the better of them because they put their faith in the lord the god of their fathers
 and abijah went after jeroboam and took some of his towns beth el with its small towns and jeshanah with its small towns and ephron with its small towns
 and jeroboam did not get back his power again in the life time of abijah and the lord sent death on him
 but abijah became great and had fourteen wives and became the father of twenty two sons and sixteen daughters
 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are recorded in the account of the prophet iddo
 so abijah went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of david and asa his son became king in his place in his time the land was quiet for ten years
 and asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god
 for he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down
