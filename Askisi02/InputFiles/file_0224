 go then and make disciples of all the nations giving them baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
 teaching them to keep all the rules which i have given you and see i am ever with you even to the end of the world
 and in those days john the baptist came preaching in the waste land of judaea
 saying let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
 for this is he of whom isaiah the prophet said the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 now john was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
 then jerusalem and all judaea went out to him and all the people from near jordan
 and they were given baptism by him in the river jordan saying openly that they had done wrong
 but when he saw a number of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism he said to them offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
 let your change of heart be seen in your works
 and say not to yourselves we have abraham for our father because i say to you that god is able from these stones to make children for abraham
 and even now the axe is put to the root of the trees every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down and put into the fire
 truly i give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed but he who comes after me is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to take up he will give you baptism with the holy spirit and with fire
 in whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out
 then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be given baptism by him
 but john would have kept him back saying it is i who have need of baptism from you and do you come to me
 but jesus made answer saying to him let it be so now because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete then he gave him baptism
 and jesus having been given baptism straight away went up from the water and the heavens opening he saw the spirit of god coming down on him as a dove
 and a voice came out of heaven saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 then jesus was sent by the spirit into the waste land to be tested by the evil one
 and after going without food for forty days and forty nights he was in need of it
 and the evil one came and said to him if you are the son of god give the word for these stones to become bread
 but he made answer and said it is in the writings bread is not mans only need but every word which comes out of the mouth of god
 then the evil one took him to the holy town and he put him on the highest point of the temple and said to him
 if you are the son of god let yourself go down for it is in the writings he will give his angels care over you and in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 jesus said to him again it is in the writings you may not put the lord your god to the test
 again the evil one took him up to a very high mountain and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
 and he said to him all these things will i give you if you will go down on your face and give me worship
 then said jesus to him away satan for it is in the writings give worship to the lord your god and be his servant only
 then the evil one went away from him and angels came and took care of him
