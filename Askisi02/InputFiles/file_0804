 so sisera got together all his war carriages nine hundred war carriages of iron and all the people who were with him from harosheth of the gentiles as far as the river kishon
 then deborah said to barak up  for today the lord has given sisera into your hands has not the lord gone out before you so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him
 and the lord sent fear on sisera and all his war carriages and all his army before barak and sisera got down from his war carriage and went in flight on foot
 but barak went after the war carriages and the army as far as harosheth of the gentiles and all siseras army was put to the sword not a man got away
 but sisera went in flight on foot to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin king of hazor and the family of heber the kenite
 and jael went out to sisera and said to him come in my lord come in to me without fear so he went into her tent and she put a cover over him
 then he said to her give me now a little water for i have need of a drink and opening a skin of milk she gave him drink and put the cover over him again
 and he said to her take your place at the door of the tent and if anyone comes and says to you is there any man here say no
 then jael hebers wife took a tent pin and a hammer and went up to him quietly driving the pin into his head and it went through his head into the earth for he was in a deep sleep from weariness and so he came to his end
 then jael went out and meeting barak going after sisera said to him come and i will let you see the man you are searching for so he came into her tent and saw and there was sisera stretched out dead with the tent pin in his head
 so that day god overcame jabin king of canaan before the children of israel
 and the power of the children of israel went on increasing against jabin king of canaan till he was cut off
 at that time deborah and barak the son of abinoam made this song saying
 because of the flowing hair of the fighters in israel because the people gave themselves freely give praise to the lord
 give attention o kings give ear o rulers i even i will make a song to the lord i will make melody to the lord the god of israel
 lord when you went out from seir moving like an army from the field of edom the earth was shaking and the heavens were troubled and the clouds were dropping water
 the mountains were shaking before the lord before the lord the god of israel
 in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were not used and travellers went by side roads
 country towns were no more in israel *** were no more till you deborah came up till you came up as a mother in israel
 they had no one to make arms there were no more armed men in the towns was there a body cover or a spear to be seen among forty thousand in israel
 come you rulers of israel you who gave yourselves freely among the people give praise to the lord
 let them give thought to it who go on white asses and those who are walking on the road
 give ear to the women laughing by the water springs there they will give again the story of the upright acts of the lord all the upright acts of his arm in israel
 awake  awake  deborah awake  awake  give a song up  barak and take prisoner those who took you prisoner o son of abinoam
 then the chiefs went down to the doors the lords people went down among the strong ones
 out of ephraim they came down into the valley after you benjamin among your tribesmen from machir came down the captains and from zebulun those in whose hand is the rulers rod
 your chiefs issachar were with deborah and naphtali was true to barak into the valley they went rushing out at his feet in reuben there were divisions and great searchings of heart
 why did you keep quiet among the sheep hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks
 gilead was living over jordan and dan was waiting in his ships asher kept in his place by the seas edge living by his inlets
 it was the people of zebulun who put their lives in danger even to death with naphtali on the high places of the field
