 give to everyone who comes with a request and if a man takes away your property make no attempt to get it back again
 do to others as you would have them do to you
 if you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you for even sinners have love for those who have love for them
 and if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is it to you for even sinners do the same
 and if you let those have the use of your money from whom you are hoping to get it back what credit is it to you even sinners do so to sinners hoping to get back as much as they gave
 but be loving to those who are against you and do them good and give them your money not giving up hope and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the most high for he is kind to evil men and to those who have hard hearts
 be full of pity even as your father is full of pity
 be not judges of others and you will not be judged do not give punishment to others and you will not get punishment yourselves make others free and you will be made free
 give and it will be given to you good measure crushed down full and running over they will give to you for in the same measure as you give it will be given to you again
 and he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another will they not go falling together into a hole
 the disciple is not greater than his master but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master
 and why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
 how will you say to your brother brother let me take the grain of dust out of your eye when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye o false one  first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brothers eye
 for no good tree gives bad fruit and no bad tree gives good fruit
 for every tree is judged by its fruit men do not get figs from thorns or grapes from blackberry plants
 the good man out of the good store of his heart gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth
 why do you say to me lord lord and do not the things which i say
 everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them i will make clear to you what he is like
 he is like a man building a house who went deep and put the base of it on a rock and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house it was not moved because the building was good
 but he who gives hearing without doing is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it and when the force of the river came against it straight away it came down and the destruction of that house was great
 after he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people he went into capernaum
 and a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him this servant was ill and near to death
 and when news of jesus came to his ears he sent to him rulers of the jews requesting that he would come and make his servant well
 and they when they came to jesus made their request warmly saying
 it is right for you to do this for him because he is a friend to our nation and himself has put up a synagogue for us
 and jesus went with them and when he was not far from the house the man sent friends to him saying lord do not give yourself trouble for i am not important enough for you to come into my house
 and i had the feeling that i was not even good enough to come to you but say the word only and my servant will be well
 for i myself am a man under authority having men under me and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
 and when these things were said to jesus he was surprised and turning to the mass of people coming after him said i have not seen such great faith no not in israel
 and when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well
