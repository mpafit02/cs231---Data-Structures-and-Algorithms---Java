 and put the ark of the lord on the cart and the gold images which you are sending as a sin offering in a chest by its side and send it away so that it may go
 if it goes by the land of israel to beth shemesh then this great evil is his work but if not then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing but was the working of chance
 and the men did so they took two cows yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their living place
 and they put the ark of the lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images
 and the cows took the straight way by the road to beth shemesh they went by the highway not turning to the right or to the left and the sound of their voices was clear on the road and the lords of the philistines went after them as far as the edge of beth shemesh
 and the people of beth shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it
 and the cart came into the field of joshua the beth shemite and came to a stop there by a great stone and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the lord
 then the levites took down the ark of the lord and the chest in which were the gold images and put them on the great stone and the men of beth shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the lord
 and the five lords of the philistines having seen it went back to ekron the same day
 now these are the gold images which the philistines sent as a sin offering to the lord one for ashdod one for gaza one for ashkelon one for gath one for ekron
 and the gold mice one for every town of the philistines the property of the five lords walled towns as well as country places and the great stone where they put the ark of the lord is still in the field of joshua the beth shemite to this day
 but the lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of beth shemesh for looking into the ark of the lord and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the lord had sent on them
 and the men of beth shemesh said who is able to keep his place before the lord this holy god and to whom may he go from us
 and they sent men to the people living in kiriath jearim saying the philistines have sent back the ark of the lord come and take it up to your country
 so the men of kiriath jearim came and took the ark of the lord to the house of abinadab in gibeah and they made his son eleazar holy and put the ark in his care
 and the ark was in kiriath jearim for a long time as much as twenty years and all israel was searching after the lord with weeping
 then samuel said to all israel if with all your hearts you would come back to the lord then put away all the strange gods and the astartes from among you and let your hearts be turned to the lord and be servants to him only and he will make you safe from the hands of the philistines
 so the children of israel gave up the worship of baal and astarte and became worshippers of the lord only
 then samuel said let all israel come to mizpah and i will make prayer to the lord for you
 so they came together to mizpah and got water draining it out before the lord and they took no food that day and they said we have done evil against the lord and samuel was judge of the children of israel in mizpah
 now when the philistines had news that the children of israel had come together at mizpah the lords of the philistines went up against israel and the children of israel hearing of it were full of fear
 and the children of israel said to samuel go on crying to the lord our god for us to make us safe from the hands of the philistines
 and samuel took a young lamb offering all of it as a burned offering to the lord and samuel made prayers to the lord for israel and the lord gave him an answer
 and while samuel was offering the burned offering the philistines came near for the attack on israel but at the thunder of the lords voice that day the philistines were overcome with fear and they gave way before israel
 and the men of israel went out from mizpah and went after the philistines attacking them till they came under beth car
 then samuel took a stone and put it up between mizpah and jeshanah naming it eben ezer and saying up to now the lord has been our help
 so the philistines were overcome and did not come into the country of israel again and all the days of samuel the hand of the lord was against the philistines
 and the towns which the philistines had taken were given back to israel from ekron to gath and all the country round them israel made free from the power of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites
 and samuel was judge of israel all the days of his life
 from year to year he went in turn to beth el and gilgal and mizpah judging israel in all those places
