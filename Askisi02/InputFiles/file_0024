 making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you like true servants of the unmeasured grace of god
 if anyone has anything to say let it be as the words of god if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others let him do it in the strength which is given by god so that in all things god may have the glory through jesus christ whose are the glory and the power for ever
 dear brothers do not be surprised as if it was something strange if your faith is tested as by fire
 but be glad that you are given a part in the pains of christ so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy
 if men say evil things of you because of the name of christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of god is resting on you
 let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life or as a thief or as an evil doer or as one who is over interested in other mens business
 but if he undergoes punishment as a christian that is no shame to him let him give glory to god in this name
 for the time has come for the judging starting with the church of god but if it makes a start with us what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of god
 and if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation what chance has the man without religion or the sinner
 for this reason let those who by the purpose of god undergo punishment keep on in well doing and put their souls into the safe hands of their maker
 i who am myself one of the rulers of the church and a witness of the death of christ having my part in the coming glory send this serious request to the chief men among you
 keep watch over the flock of god which is in your care using your authority not as forced to do so but gladly and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind
 not as lords over gods heritage but making yourselves examples to the flock
 and at the coming of the chief keeper of the sheep you will be given the eternal crown of glory
 and in the same way let the younger men be ruled by the older ones let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants for god is a hater of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low
 for this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of god so that when the time comes you may be lifted up
 putting all your troubles on him for he takes care of you
 be serious and keep watch the evil one who is against you goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food
 do not give way to him but be strong in your faith in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles
 and after you have undergone pain for a little time the god of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through christ jesus will himself give you strength and support and make you complete in every good thing
 his is the power for ever so be it
 i have sent you this short letter by silvanus a true brother in my opinion comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of god keep to it
 she who is in babylon who has a part with you in the purpose of god sends you her love and so does my son mark
 give one another the kiss of love peace be to you all in christ
 simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our god and saviour jesus christ
 may grace and peace ever be increasing in you in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
 because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue
 and through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued so that by them we might have our part in gods being and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh
 so for this very cause take every care joining virtue to faith and knowledge to virtue
 and self control to knowledge and a quiet mind to self control and fear of god to a quiet mind
