 do you give strength to the horse is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power
 is it through you that he is shaking like a locust in the pride of his loud sounding breath
 he is stamping with joy in the valley he makes sport of fear
 in his strength he goes out against the arms of war turning not away from the sword
 the bow is sounding against him he sees the shining point of spear and arrow
 shaking with passion he is biting the earth he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn
 when it comes to his ears he says aha  he is smelling the fight from far off and hearing the thunder of the captains and the war cries
 is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight stretching out his wings to the south
 or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up and makes his resting place on high
 on the rock is his house and on the mountain top his strong place
 from there he is watching for food his eye sees it far off
 his young have blood for their drink and where the dead bodies are there is he to be seen
 and eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 if one says a word will it be a weariness to you but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind
 truly you have been a helper to others and you have made feeble hands strong
 he who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words and you have given strength to bent knees
 but now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you you are touched by it and your mind is troubled
 is not your fear of god your support and your upright way of life your hope
 have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man or when were the god fearing ever cut off
 what i have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed and evil planted get the same for themselves
 by the breath of god destruction takes them and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off
 though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice may be loud the teeth of the young lions are broken
 the old lion comes to his end for need of food and the young of the she lion go wandering in all directions
 a word was given to me secretly and the low sound of it came to my ears
 in troubled thoughts from visions of the night when deep sleep comes on men
 fear came on me and shaking and my bones were full of trouble
 and a breath was moving over my face the hair of my flesh became stiff
 something was present before me but i was not able to see it clearly there was a form before my eyes a quiet voice came to my ears saying
 may a man be upright before god or a man be clean before his maker
 truly he puts no faith in his servants and he sees error in his angels
