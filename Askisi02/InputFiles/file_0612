 and judah said let her keep the things so that we may not be shamed i sent the young goat but you did not see the woman
 now about three months after this word came to judah that tamar his daughter in law had been acting like a loose woman and was with child and judah said take her out and let her be burned
 and while she was being taken out she sent word to her father in law saying the man whose property these things are is the father of my child say then whose are this ring and this cord and this stick
 then judah said openly that they were his and said she is more upright than i am for i did not give her to shelah my son and he had no more connection with her
 and when the time came for her to give birth it was clear that there were two children in her body
 and while she was in the act of giving birth one of them put out his hand and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand saying this one came out first
 but then he took his hand back again and his brother came first to birth and the woman said what an opening you have made for yourself  so he was named perez
 and then his brother came out with the red thread round his hand and he was named zerah
 now joseph was taken down to egypt and potiphar the egyptian a captain of high position in pharaohs house got him for a price from the ishmaelites who had taken him there
 and the lord was with joseph and he did well and he was living in the house of his master the egyptian
 and his master saw that the lord was with him making everything he did go well
 and having a high opinion of joseph as his servant he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had
 and from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property the blessing of the lord was with the egyptian because of joseph the blessing of the lord was on all he had in the house and in the field
 and he gave joseph control of all his property keeping no account of anything but only the food which was put before him now joseph was very beautiful in form and face
 and after a time his masters wife looking on joseph with desire said to him be my lover
 but he would not and said to her you see that my master keeps no account of what i do in his house and has put all his property in my control
 so that no one has more authority in this house than i have he has kept nothing back from me but you because you are his wife how then may i do this great wrong sinning against god
 and day after day she went on requesting joseph to come to her and be her lover but he would not give ear to her
 now one day he went into the house to do his work and not one of the men of the house was inside
 and pulling at his coat she said come to my bed but slipping out of his coat he went running away
 and when she saw that he had got away letting her keep his coat
 she sent for the men of her house and said to them see he has let a hebrew come here and make sport of us he came to my bed and i gave a loud cry
 and hearing it he went running out without his coat
 and she kept his coat by her till his master came back
 then she gave him the same story saying the hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me
 and when i gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat
 and hearing his wifes account of what his servant had done he became very angry
 and josephs master took him and put him in prison in the place where the kings prisoners were kept in chains and he was there in the prison house
 but the lord was with joseph and was good to him and made the keeper of the prison his friend
 and the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under josephs control and he was responsible for whatever was done there
