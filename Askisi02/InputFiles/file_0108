 now jesus had love in his heart for martha and her sister and lazarus
 so when the news came to him that lazarus was ill he did not go from the place where he was for two days
 then after that time he said to his disciples let us go into judaea again
 the disciples said to him master the jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned and are you going back there again
 then jesus said in answer are there not twelve hours in the day a man may go about in the day without falling because he sees the light of this world
 but if a man goes about in the night he may have a fall because the light is not in him
 these things said he and after that he said to them lazarus our friend is at rest but i go so that i may make him come out of his sleep
 then his disciples said to him lord if he is resting he will get well
 jesus however was talking of his death but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep
 then jesus said to them clearly lazarus is dead
 and because of you i am glad i was not there so that you may have faith but let us go to him
 then thomas who was named didymus said to the other disciples let us go so that we may be with him in death
 now when jesus came he made the discovery that lazarus had been put into the earth four days before
 now bethany was near to jerusalem about two miles away
 and a number of jews had come to martha and mary to give them comfort about their brother
 when martha had the news that jesus was on the way she went out to him but mary did not go from the house
 then martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
 but i am certain that even now whatever request you make to god god will give it to you
 jesus said to her your brother will come to life again
 martha said to him i am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day
 jesus said to her i am myself that day and that life he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead
 and no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death is this your faith
 she said to him yes lord my faith is that you are the christ the son of god who was to come into the world
 and having said this she went away and said secretly to her sister mary the master is here and has sent for you
 and mary hearing this got up quickly and went to him
 now jesus had not at this time come into the town but was still in the place where martha had seen him
 then the jews who were with her in the house comforting her when they saw mary get up quickly and go out went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there
 when mary came to where jesus was and saw him she went down at his feet saying lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
 and when jesus saw her weeping and saw the jews weeping who came with her his spirit was moved and he was troubled
 and said where have you put him they said come and see lord
