 and he came near and the woman said are you joab and he said in answer i am then she said give ear to your servants words and he said i am giving ear
 then she said in the old days there was a saying let them put the question in abel and in dan saying has what was ordered by men of good faith in israel ever come to an end
 your purpose is the destruction of a mother town in israel why would you put an end to the heritage of the lord
 and joab answering her said far far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction
 not so but a man of the hill country of ephraim sheba son of bichri by name has taken up arms against the king against david give up this man only and i will go away from the town and the woman said to joab his head will be dropped over the wall to you
 then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town and they had shebas head cut off and sent out to joab and he had the horn sounded and sent them all away from the town every man to his tent and joab went back to jerusalem to the king
 now joab was over all the army and benaiah the son of jehoiada was at the head of the cherethites and the pelethites
 and adoram was overseer of the forced work and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder
 and sheva was the scribe and zadok and abiathar were priests
 and in addition ira the jairite was a priest to david
 in the days of david they were short of food for three years year after year and david went before the lord for directions and the lord said on saul and on his family there is blood because he put the gibeonites to death
 then the king sent for the gibeonites  now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but were the last of the amorites to whom the children of israel had given an oath but saul in his passion for the children of israel and judah had made an attempt on their lives 
 so david said to the gibeonites what may i do for you how am i to make up to you for your wrongs so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the lord
 and the gibeonites said to him it is not a question of silver and gold between us and saul or his family and it is not in our power to put to death any man in israel and he said say then what am i to do for you
 and they said to the king as for the man by whom we were wasted and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of israel
 let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the lord in gibeon on the hill of the lord and the king said i will give them
 but the king did not give up mephibosheth the son of sauls son jonathan because of the lords oath made between david and jonathan the son of saul
 but the king took armoni and mephibosheth the two sons of saul to whom rizpah the daughter of aiah had given birth and the five sons of sauls daughter merab whose father was adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite
 and he gave them up to the gibeonites and they put them to death hanging them on the mountain before the lord all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain cutting at the start of the cutting of the barley
 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took haircloth placing it on the rock as a bed for herself from the start of the grain cutting till rain came down on them from heaven and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day or the beasts of the field by night
 and news was given to david of what rizpah the daughter of aiah one of sauls wives had done
 and david went and took the bones of saul and his son jonathan from the men of jabesh gilead who had taken them away secretly from the public place of beth shan where the philistines had put them hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put saul to death in gilboa
 and he took the bones of saul and his son jonathan from that place and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging
 and they put them with the bones of saul and his son jonathan in the resting place of kish his father in zela in the country of benjamin they did all the king had given them orders to do and after that god gave ear to their prayers for the land
 and the philistines went to war again with israel and david went down with his people and while they were at gob they had a fight with the philistines
 and there came against david one of the offspring of the rephaim whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight and having a new sword he made an attempt to put david to death
 but abishai the son of zeruiah came to his help and turning on the philistine gave him his death blow then davids men took an oath and said never again are you to go out with us to the fight so that you may not put out the light of israel
 now after this there was war with the philistines again at gob and sibbecai the hushathite put to death saph one of the offspring of the rephaim
 and again there was war with the philistines at gob and elhanan the son of jair the beth lehemite put to death goliath the gittite the stem of whose spear was like a cloth workers rod
 and again there was war at gath where there was a very tall man who had twenty four fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the rephaim
