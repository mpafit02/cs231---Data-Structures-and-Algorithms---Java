 and when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him but only peter and john and james and the father of the girl and her mother
 and all the people were weeping and crying for her but he said do not be sad for she is not dead but sleeping
 and they were laughing at him being certain that she was dead
 but he taking her hand said to her my child get up
 and her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away and he gave orders that food was to be given to her
 and her father and mother were full of wonder but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone
 and getting the twelve together he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases to make them well
 and he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of god and to make well those who were ill
 and he said to them take nothing for your journey no stick or bag or bread or money and do not take two coats
 and if you go into a house let that house be your resting place till you go away
 and if any people will not take you in when you go away from that town put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them
 and they went away journeying through all the towns preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places
 now herod the king had news of all these things and he was in doubt because it was said by some people that john had come back from the dead
 and by some that elijah had come and by others that one of the old prophets had come back to life
 and herod said i put john to death but who is this of whom such stories are given to me and he had a desire to see him
 and the twelve when they came back gave him an account of what they had done and he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named beth saida
 but the people getting news of it went after him and he was pleased to see them and gave them teaching about the kingdom of god and made those well who were in need of it
 and the day went on and the twelve came to him and said send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting places and food for themselves for we are in a waste place
 but he said give them food yourselves and they said we have only five cakes of bread and two fishes if we do not go and get food for all these people
 for there were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them be seated in groups about fifty to a group
 and they did so and made them all be seated
 and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when they had been broken he gave them to the disciples to give to the people
 and they all took the food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits which were over twelve baskets full
 and it came about that when he was in prayer by himself and the disciples were with him he put a question to them saying who do the people say i am
 and they answering said john the baptist but others say elijah and others that one of the old prophets has come back
 and he said but who do you say that i am and peter answering said the christ of god
 but he gave them special orders not to say this to any man
 saying the son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law and be put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
 and he said to them all if any man has a desire to come after me let him give up all and take up his cross every day and come after me
 for whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will keep it
