 then the responsible men of the town will send for the man and have talk with him and if he still says i will not take her
 then his brothers wife is to come to him before the responsible men of the town and take his shoe off his foot and put shame on him and say so let it be done to the man who will not take care of his brothers name
 and his family will be named in israel the house of him whose shoe has been taken off
 if two men are fighting and the wife of one of them coming to the help of her husband takes the other by the private parts
 her hand is to be cut off have no pity on her
 do not have in your bag different weights a great and a small
 or in your house different measures a great and a small
 but have a true weight and a true measure so that your life may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 for all who do such things and all whose ways are not upright are disgusting to the lord your god
 keep in mind what amalek did to you on your way from egypt
 how meeting you on the way he made an attack on you when you were tired and without strength cutting off all the feeble ones at the end of your line and the fear of god was not in him
 so when the lord your god has given you rest from all who are against you on every side in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage see to it that the memory of amalek is cut off from the earth keep this in mind
 now when you have come into the land which the lord is giving you for your heritage and you have made it yours and are living in it
 you are to take a part of the first fruits of the earth which you get from the land which the lord your god is giving you and put it in a basket and go to the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place of his name
 and you are to come to him who is priest at that time and say to him i give witness today before the lord your god that i have come into the land which the lord made an oath to our fathers to give us
 then the priest will take the basket from your hand and put it down in front of the altar of the lord your god
 and these are the words which you will say before the lord your god my father was a wandering aramaean and he went down with a small number of people into egypt there he became a great and strong nation
 and the egyptians were cruel to us crushing us under a hard yoke
 and our cry went up to the lord the god of our fathers and the lords ear was open to the voice of our cry and his eyes took note of our grief and the crushing weight of our work
 and the lord took us out of egypt with a strong hand and a stretched out arm with works of power and signs and wonders
 and he has been our guide to this place and has given us this land a land flowing with milk and honey
 so now i have come here with the first of the fruits of the earth which you o lord have given me then you will put it down before the lord your god and give him worship
 and you will have joy in every good thing which the lord your god has given to you and to your family and the levite and the man from a strange land who is with you will take part in your joy
 when you have taken out a tenth from the tenth of all your produce in the third year which is the year when this has to be done give it to the levite and the man from a strange land and the child without a father and the widow so that they may have food in your towns and be full
 and say before the lord your god i have taken all the holy things out of my house and have given them to the levite and the man from a strange land and him who has no father and the widow as you have given me orders i have kept in mind all your orders in nothing have i gone against them
 no part of these things has been used for food in a time of weeping or put away when i was unclean or given for the dead i have given ear to the voice of the lord my god and have done all you have given me orders to do
 so looking down from your holy place in heaven send your blessing on your people israel and on the land which you have given us as you said in your oath to our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey
 today the lord your god gives you orders to keep all these laws and decisions so then keep and do them with all your heart and all your soul
 today you have given witness that the lord is your god and that you will go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions and give ear to his voice
 and the lord has made it clear this day that you are a special people to him as he gave you his word and that you are to keep all his orders
