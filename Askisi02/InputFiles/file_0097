 as it is said today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart as when you made him angry
 who made him angry when his voice came to them was it not all those who came out of egypt with moses
 and with whom was he angry for forty years was it not with those who did evil who came to their deaths in the waste land
 and to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest was it not to those who went against his orders
 so we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief
 let us then though we still have gods word that we may come into his rest go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so
 and truly the good news came to us even as it did to them but the hearing of the word did them no good because they were not united in faith with the true hearers
 for those of us who have belief come into his rest even as he has said as i said in my oath when i was angry they may not come into my rest though the works were done from the time of the making of the world
 for in one place he has said of the seventh day and god had rest from all his works on the seventh day
 and in the same place he says again they will not come into my rest
 so that as it is clear that some have to go in and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against gods orders
 after a long time again naming a certain day he says in david today  as he had said before  today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart
 for if joshua had given them rest he would not have said anything about another day
 so that there is still a sabbath keeping for the people of god
 for the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works as god did from his
 because of this let us have a strong desire to come into that rest and let no one go after the example of those who went against gods orders
 for the word of god is living and full of power and is sharper than any two edged sword cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit the bones and the muscles and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart
 and there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him there is nothing covered but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do
 having then a great high priest who has made his way through the heavens even jesus the son of god let us be strong in our faith
 for we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested but without sin
 then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear so that mercy may be given to us and we may get grace for our help in time of need
 every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with god so that he may make offerings for sins
 he is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way because he himself is feeble
 and being feeble he has to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people
 and no man who is not given authority by god as aaron was takes this honour for himself
 in the same way christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest but was given it by him who said you are my son this day i have given you being
 as he says in another place you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 who in the days of his flesh having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death had his prayer answered because of his fear of god
 and though he was a son through the pain which he underwent the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under gods orders
 and when he had been made complete he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders
