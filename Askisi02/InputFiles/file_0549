 i will let loose my wrath on sin the strong place of egypt cutting off the mass of the people of no
 and i will put a fire in egypt syene will be twisting in pain and no will be broken into as by the onrush of waters
 the young men of on and pi beseth will be put to the sword and these towns will be taken away prisoners
 and at tehaphnehes the day will become dark when the yoke of egypt is broken there and the pride of her power comes to an end as for her she will be covered with a cloud and her daughters will be taken away prisoners
 and i will send my punishments on egypt and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man the arm of pharaoh king of egypt has been broken by me and no band has been put round it to make it well no band has been twisted round it to make it strong for gripping the sword
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against pharaoh king of egypt and by me his strong arm will be broken and i will make the sword go out of his hand
 and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
 and i will make the arms of the king of babylon strong and will put my sword in his hand but pharaohs arms will be broken and he will give cries of pain before him like the cries of a man wounded to death
 and i will make the arms of the king of babylon strong and the arms of pharaoh will be hanging down and they will be certain that i am the lord when i put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and it is stretched out against the land of egypt
 and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the eleventh year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say to pharaoh king of egypt and to his people whom are you like in your great power
 see a pine tree with beautiful branches and thick growth giving shade and very tall and its top was among the clouds
 it got strength from the waters and the deep made it tall its streams went round about its planted land and it sent out its waterways to all the trees of the field
 in this way it became taller than all the trees of the field and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters
 in its branches all the birds of heaven came to rest and under its arms all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young and great nations were living in its shade
 so it was beautiful being so tall and its branches so long for its root was by great waters
 no cedars were equal to it in the garden of god the fir trees were not like its branches and plane trees were as nothing in comparison with its arms no tree in the garden of god was so beautiful
 i made it beautiful with its mass of branches so that all the trees in the garden of god were full of envy of it
 for this cause the lord has said because he is tall and has put his top among the clouds and his heart is full of pride because he is so high
 i have given him up into the hands of a strong one of the nations he will certainly give him the reward of his sin driving him out
 and men from strange lands who are to be feared among the nations after cutting him off have let him be on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have come down his arms are broken by all the waterways of the land all the peoples of the earth have gone from his shade and have let him be
 all the birds of heaven have come to rest on his broken stem where it is stretched on the earth and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches
 in order that no trees by the waters may be lifted up in their growth putting their tops among the clouds and that no trees which are watered may take their place on high for they are all given up to death to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men with those who go down to the underworld
 this is what the lord has said the day when he goes down to the underworld i will make the deep full of grief for him i will keep back her streams and the great waters will be stopped i will make lebanon dark for him and all the trees of the field will be feeble because of him
 i will send shaking on the nations at the sound of his fall when i send him down to the underworld with those who go down into the deep and on earth they will be comforting themselves all the trees of eden the best of lebanon even all the watered ones
 and they will go down with him to the underworld to those who have been put to the sword even those who were his helpers living under his shade among the nations
 whom then are you like for you will be sent down with the trees of eden into the lowest parts of the earth there you will be stretched out among those without circumcision with those who were put to the sword this is pharaoh and all his people says the lord
