 destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge because you have given up knowledge i will give you up so that you will be no priest to me because you have not kept in mind the law of your god i will not keep your children in my memory
 even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me i will let their glory be changed into shame
 the sin of my people is like food to them and their desire is for their wrongdoing
 and the priest will be like the people i will give them punishment for their evil ways and the reward of their acts
 they will have food but they will not be full they will be false to me but they will not be increased because they no longer give thought to the lord
 loose ways and new wine take away wisdom
 my people get knowledge from their tree and their rod gives them news for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering and they have been false to their god
 they make offerings on the tops of mountains burning perfumes in high places under trees of every sort because their shade is good and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands
 i will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour for they make themselves separate with loose women and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods the people who have no wisdom will be sent away
 do not you o israel come into error do not you o judah come to gilgal or go up to beth aven or take an oath by the living lord
 for israel is uncontrolled like a cow which may not be controlled now will the lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place
 ephraim is joined to false gods let him be
 their drink has become bitter they are completely false her rulers take pleasure in shame
 they are folded in the skirts of the wind they will be shamed because of their offerings
 give ear to this o priests give attention o israel and you family of the king for you are to be judged you have been a deceit at mizpah and a net stretched out on tabor
 they have gone deep in the evil ways of shittim but i am the judge of all
 i have knowledge of ephraim and israel is not secret from me for now o ephraim you have been false to me israel has become unclean
 their works will not let them come back to their god for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the lord
 and the pride of israel gives an answer to his face and ephraim will have a fall through his sins and the fall of judah will be the same as theirs
 they will go with their flocks and their herds in search of the lord but they will not see him he has taken himself out of their view
 they have been false to the lord they have given birth to strange children now the new moon will make them waste with their fields
 let the horn be sounded in gibeah and in ramah give a loud cry in beth aven they are after you o benjamin
 ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment i have given knowledge among the tribes of israel of what is certain
 the rulers of judah are like those who take away a landmark i will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water
 ephraim is troubled he is crushed by his judges because he took pleasure in walking after deceit
 and so to ephraim i am like a wasting insect and a destruction to the children of judah
 when ephraim saw his disease and judah his wound then ephraim went to assyria and sent to the great king but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound
 for i will be to ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the children of judah i even i will give him wounds and go away i will take him away and there will be no helper
 i will go back to my place till they are made waste in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me
 come let us go back to the lord for he has given us wounds and he will make us well he has given blows and he will give help
