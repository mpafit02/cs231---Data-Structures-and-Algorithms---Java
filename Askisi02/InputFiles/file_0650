 for this cause the earth is given up to the curse and those in it are judged as sinners for this cause those living on the earth are burned up and the rest are small in number
 the new wine is thin the vine is feeble and all the glad hearted make sounds of grief
 the pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end and the voices of those who are glad
 there is no more drinking of wine with a song strong drink will be bitter to those who take it
 the town is waste and broken down every house is shut up so that no man may come in
 there is a crying in the streets because of the wine there is an end of all delight the joy of the land is gone
 in the town all is waste and in the public place is destruction
 for it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples like the shaking of an olive tree as the last of the grapes after the getting in is done
 but those will be making sounds of joy they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the lord
 give praise to the lord in the east to the name of the lord the god of israel in the sea lands
 from the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs glory to the upright but i said i am wasting away wasting away the curse is on me  the false ones go on in their false way yes they go on acting falsely
 fear and death and the net are come on you o people of the earth
 and it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net for the windows on high are open and the bases of the earth are shaking
 the earth is completely broken it is parted in two it is violently moved
 the earth will be moving uncertainly like a man overcome by drink it will be shaking like a tent and the weight of its sin will be on it crushing it down so that it will not get up again
 and in that day the lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high and on the kings of the earth on the earth
 and they will be got together like prisoners in the prison house and after a long time they will have their punishment
 then the moon will be veiled and the sun put to shame for the lord of armies will be ruling in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his judges he will let his glory be seen
 o lord you are my god i will give praise to you i will give honour to your name for you have done great acts of power your purposes in the past have been made true and certain in effect
 for you have made a town a waste place a strong town a mass of broken walls the tower of the men of pride has come to an end it will never be put up again
 for this cause will the strong people give glory to you the town of the cruel ones will be in fear of you
 for you have been a strong place for the poor and the crushed in their trouble a safe place from the storm a shade from the heat when the wrath of the cruel ones is like a winter storm
 as heat by the shade of a cloud the noise of the men of pride has been made quiet by you as heat by the shade of a cloud the song of the cruel ones has been stopped
 and in this mountain will the lord of armies make for all peoples a feast of good things a feast of wines long stored of good things sweet to the taste of wines long kept and tested
 and in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples and the veil which is stretched over all nations
 he has put an end to death for ever and the lord god will take away all weeping and he will put an end to the shame of his people in all the earth for the lord has said it
 and in that day it will be said see this is our god we have been waiting for him and he will be our saviour this is the lord in whom is our hope we will be glad and have delight in his salvation
 for in this mountain will the hand of the lord come to rest and moab will be crushed down in his place even as the dry stems of the grain are crushed under foot in the waste place
 and if he puts out his hands like a man stretching out his hands in swimming the lord will make low his pride however expert his designs
 and the strong tower of your walls has been broken by him made low and crushed even to the dust
