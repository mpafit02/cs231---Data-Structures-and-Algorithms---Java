 son of man let your face be turned to jerusalem let your words be dropped in the direction of her holy place and be a prophet against the land of israel
 and say to the land of israel these are the words of the lord see i am against you and i will take my sword out of its cover cutting off from you the upright and the evil
 because i am going to have the upright and the evil cut off from you for this cause my sword will go out from its cover against all flesh from the south to the north
 and all flesh will see that i the lord have taken my sword out of its cover and it will never go back
 make sounds of grief son of man with body bent and a bitter heart make sounds of grief before their eyes
 and when they say to you why are you making sounds of grief then say because of the news for it is coming and every heart will become soft and all hands will be feeble and every spirit will be burning low and all knees will be turned to water see it is coming and it will be done says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say as a prophet these are the words of the lord say a sword a sword which has been made sharp and polished
 it has been made sharp to give death it is polished so that it may be like a thunder flame 
 and i have given it to the polisher so that it may be taken in the hand he has made the sword sharp he has had it polished to put it into the hand of him who gives death
 give loud cries and make sounds of grief o son of man for it has come on my people it has come on all the rulers of israel fear of the sword has come on my people for this cause give signs of grief
 
 so then son of man be a prophet and put your hands together with a loud sound and give two blows with the sword and even three it is the sword of those who are wounded even the sword of the wounded the great sword which goes round about them
 in order that hearts may become soft and the number of those who are falling may be increased i have sent death by the sword against all their doors you are made like a flame you are polished for death
 be pointed to the right to the left wherever your edge is ordered
 and i will put my hands together with a loud sound and i will let my wrath have rest i the lord have said it
 and the word of the lord came to me again saying
 and you son of man have two ways marked out so that the sword of the king of babylon may come let the two of them come out of one land and let there be a pillar at the top of the road
 put a pillar at the top of the road for the sword to come to rabbah in the land of the children of ammon and to judah and to jerusalem in the middle of her
 for the king of babylon took his place at the parting of the ways at the top of the two roads to make use of secret arts shaking the arrows this way and that he put questions to the images of his gods he took note of the inner parts of dead beasts
 at his right hand was the fate of jerusalem to give orders for destruction to send up the war cry to put engines of war against the doors lifting up earthworks building walls
 and this answer given by secret arts will seem false to those who have given their oaths and have let them be broken but he will keep the memory of evil doing so that they may be taken
 for this cause the lord has said because you have made your evil doing come to mind by the uncovering of your wrongdoing causing your sins to be seen in all your evil doings because you have come to mind you will be taken in them
 and you o evil one wounded to death o ruler of israel whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
 this is what the lord has said take away the holy head dress take off the crown this will not be again let that which is low be lifted up and that which is high be made low
 i will let it be overturned overturned overturned this will not be again till he comes whose right it is and i will give it to him
 and you son of man say as a prophet this is what the lord has said about the children of ammon and about their shame say a sword even a sword let loose polished for death to make it shining so that it may be like a flame
 your vision is to no purpose your use of secret arts gives a false answer to put it on the necks of evil doers who are wounded to death whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
 go back into your cover in the place where you were made in the land from which you were taken i will be your judge
 and i will let loose my burning passion on you breathing out on you the fire of my wrath and i will give you up into the hands of men like beasts trained to destruction
