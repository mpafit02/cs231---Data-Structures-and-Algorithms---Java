 and balaam said to balak make me seven altars here and get seven oxen and seven male sheep ready for me
 and balak did as balaam said offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 now when balaam saw that it was the lords pleasure to give his blessing to israel he did not as at other times make use of secret arts but turning his face to the waste land
 and lifting up his eyes he saw israel there with their tents in the order of their tribes and the spirit of god came on him
 and moved by the spirit he said these are the words of balaam son of beor the words of the man whose eyes are open
 he says whose ears are open to the words of god who has seen the vision of the ruler of all falling down but having his eyes open
 how fair are your tents o jacob your houses o israel 
 they are stretched out like valleys like gardens by the riverside like flowering trees planted by the lord like cedar trees by the waters
 peoples will be in fear before his strength his arm will be on great nations his king will be higher than agag and his kingdom made great in honour
 it is god who has taken him out of egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox the nations warring against him will be his food their bones will be broken they will be wounded with his arrows
 he took his sleep stretched out like a lion and like a she lion by whom will his rest be broken may a blessing be on everyone who gives you blessing and a curse on everyone by whom you are cursed
 then balak was full of wrath against balaam and angrily waving his hands he said to balaam i sent for you so that those who are against me might be cursed but now see three times you have given them a blessing
 go back quickly to the place you came from it was my purpose to give you a place of honour but now the lord has kept you back from honour
 then balaam said to balak did i not say to the men you sent to me
 even if balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to go outside the orders of the lord doing good or evil at the impulse of my mind whatever the lord says i will say
 so now i will go back to my people but first let me make clear to you what this people will do to your people in days to come
 then he went on with his story and said these are the words of balaam the son of beor the words of him whose eyes are open
 he says whose ear is open to the words of god who has knowledge of the most high who has seen the vision of the ruler of all falling down and having his eyes open
 i see him but not now looking on him but not near a star will come out of jacob and a rod of authority out of israel sending destruction to the farthest limits of moab and on the head of all the sons of sheth
 edom will be his heritage and he will put an end to the last of the people of seir
 and israel will go on in strength and jacob will have rule over his haters
 then turning his eyes to amalek he went on with his story and said amalek was the first of the nations but his part will be destruction for ever
 and looking on the kenites he went on with his story and said strong is your living place and your secret place is safe in the rock
 but still the kenites will be wasted till asshur takes you away prisoner
 then he went on with his story and said but who may keep his life when god does this
 but ships will come from the direction of kittim troubling asshur and troubling eber and like the others their fate will be destruction
 then balaam got up and went back to his place and balak went away
 now when israel was living in shittim the people became false to the lord doing evil with the daughters of moab
 for they sent for the people to be present at the offerings made to their gods and the people took part in their feasts and gave honour to their gods
 so israel had relations with the women of moab in honour of the baal of peor and the lord was moved to wrath against israel
