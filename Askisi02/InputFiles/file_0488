 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out over the land of egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land even everything untouched by the ice storm
 and moses rod was stretched out over the land of egypt and the lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind
 and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt resting on every part of the land in very great numbers such an army of locusts had never been seen before and never will be again
 for all the face of the earth was covered with them so that the land was black and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice storm they took for food not one green thing no plant or tree was to be seen in all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh quickly sent for moses and aaron and said i have done evil against the lord your god and against you
 let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only and make prayer to the lord your god that he will take away from me this death only
 so he went out from pharaoh and made prayer to the lord
 and the lord sent a very strong west wind which took up the locusts driving them into the red sea not one locust was to be seen in any part of egypt
 but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of israel go
 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out to heaven and all the land of egypt will be dark so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark
 and when moses hand was stretched out dark night came over all the land of egypt for three days
 they were not able to see one another and no one got up from his place for three days but where the children of israel were living it was light
 then pharaoh sent for moses and said go and give worship to the lord only let your flocks and your herds be kept here your little ones may go with you
 but moses said you will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the lord our god
 so our cattle will have to go with us not one may be kept back for they are needed for the worship of the lord our god we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place
 but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he would not let them go
 and pharaoh said to him go away from me take care that you come not again before me for the day when you see my face again will be your last
 and moses said you say truly i will not see your face again
 and the lord said to moses i will send one more punishment on pharaoh and on egypt after that he will let you go and when he does let you go he will not keep one of you back but will send you out by force
 so go now and give orders to the people that every man and every woman is to get from his or her neighbour ornaments of silver and of gold
 and the lord gave the people grace in the eyes of the egyptians for the man moses was highly honoured in the land of egypt by pharaohs servants and the people
 and moses said this is what the lord says about the middle of the night i will go out through egypt
 and death will come to every mothers first male child in all the land of egypt from the child of pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the servant girl crushing the grain and the first births of all the cattle
 and there will be a great cry through all the land of egypt such as never has been or will be again
 but against the children of israel man or beast not so much as the tongue of a dog will be moved so that you may see how the lord makes a division between israel and the egyptians
 and all these your servants will come to me going down on their faces before me and saying go out and all your people with you and after that i will go out and he went away from pharaoh burning with wrath
 and the lord said to moses pharaoh will not give ear to you so that my wonders may be increased in the land of egypt
 all these wonders moses and aaron did before pharaoh but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land
 and the lord said to moses and aaron in the land of egypt
 let this month be to you the first of months the first month of the year
