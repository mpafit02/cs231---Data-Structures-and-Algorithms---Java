 and solomon sent back word to hiram saying
 you have knowledge that david my father was not able to make a house for the name of the lord his god because of the wars which were round him on every side till the lord put all those who were against him under his feet
 but now the lord my god has given me rest on every side no one is making trouble and no evil is taking place
 and so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the lord my god as he said to david my father your son whom i will make king in your place will be the builder of a house for my name
 so now will you have cedar trees from lebanon cut down for me and my servants will be with your servants and i will give you payment for your servants at whatever rate you say for it is common knowledge that we have no such wood cutters among us as the men of zidon
 and these words of solomon made hiram glad and he said now may the lord be praised who has given to david a wise son to be king over this great people
 then hiram sent to solomon saying the words you sent have been given to me i will do all your desire in the question of cedar wood and cypress wood
 my men will take them down from lebanon to the sea where i will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say and i will have them cut up there so that you may take them away as for payment it will be enough if you give me food for my people
 so hiram gave solomon all the cedar wood and cypress wood he had need of
 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of grain as food for his people and twenty measures of clear oil this he did every year
 now the lord had given solomon wisdom as he had said to him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they made an agreement together
 then king solomon got together men for the forced work through all israel thirty thousand men in number
 and sent them to lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month for a month they were working in lebanon and for two months in their country and adoniram was in control of them
 then he had seventy thousand for the work of transport and eighty thousand stone cutters in the mountains
 in addition to the chiefs of the responsible men put by solomon to oversee the work three thousand and three hundred in authority over the workmen
 by the kings orders great stones stones of high price were cut out so that the base of the house might be made of squared stone
 solomons builders and hirams builders did the work of cutting them and put edges on them and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house
 in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel came out of the land of egypt in the fourth year that solomon was king of israel in the month ziv which is the second month the building of the lords house was started
 the house which solomon made for the lord was sixty cubits long twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
 the covered way before the temple of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and ten cubits wide in front of the house
 and for the house he made windows with network across
 and against the walls all round and against the walls of the temple and of the inmost room he put up wings with side rooms all round
 the lowest line of them being five cubits wide the middle six cubits wide and the third seven cubits for there was a space all round the outside walls of the house so that the boards supporting the rooms did not have to be fixed in the walls of the house
  and the stones used in the building of the house were squared at the place where they were cut out there was no sound of hammer or axe or any iron instrument while they were building the house 
 the door to the lowest side rooms was in the right side of the house and they went up by twisting steps into the middle rooms and from the middle into the third
 so he put up the house and made it complete roofing it with boards of cedar wood
 and he put up the line of side rooms against the walls of the house fifteen cubits high resting against the house on boards of cedar wood
  and the word of the lord came to solomon saying
 about this house which you are building if you will keep my laws and give effect to my decisions and be guided by my rules i will give effect to my word which i gave to david your father
 and i will be ever among the children of israel and will not go away from my people
