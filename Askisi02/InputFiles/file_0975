 he put his faith in the lord let the lord be his saviour now let the lord be his saviour because he had delight in him
 but it was you who took care of me from the day of my birth you gave me faith even from my mothers breasts
 i was in your hands even before my birth you are my god from the time when i was in my mothers body
 be not far from me for trouble is near there is no one to give help
 a great herd of oxen is round me i am shut in by the strong oxen of bashan
 i saw their mouths wide open like lions crying after food
 i am flowing away like water and all my bones are out of place my heart is like wax it has become soft in my body
 my throat is dry like a broken vessel my tongue is fixed to the roof of my mouth and the dust of death is on my lips
 dogs have come round me i am shut in by the band of evil doers they made wounds in my hands and feet
 i am able to see all my bones their looks are fixed on me
 they make a division of my robes among them by the decision of chance they take my clothing
 do not be far from me o lord o my strength come quickly to my help
 make my soul safe from the sword my life from the power of the dog
 be my saviour from the lions mouth let me go free from the horns of the cruel oxen
 i will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers i will give you praise among the people
 you who have fear of the lord give him praise all you seed of jacob give him glory go in fear of him all you seed of israel
 for he has not been unmoved by the pain of him who is troubled or kept his face covered from him but he has given an answer to his cry
 my praise will be of you in the great meeting i will make my offerings before his worshippers
 the poor will have a feast of good things those who make search for the lord will give him praise your heart will have life for ever
 all the ends of the earth will keep it in mind and be turned to the lord all the families of the nations will give him worship
 for the kingdom is the lords he is the ruler among the nations
 all the fat ones of the earth will give him worship all those who go down to the dust will make themselves low before him even he who has not enough for the life of his soul
 a seed will be his servant the doings of the lord will be made clear to the generation which comes after
 they will come and make his righteousness clear to a people of the future because he has done this
 &lta psalm of david&gt the lord takes care of me as his sheep i will not be without any good thing
 he makes a resting place for me in the green fields he is my guide by the quiet waters
 he gives new life to my soul he is my guide in the ways of righteousness because of his name
 yes though i go through the valley of deep shade i will have no fear of evil for you are with me your rod and your support are my comfort
 you make ready a table for me in front of my haters you put oil on my head my cup is overflowing
 truly blessing and mercy will be with me all the days of my life and i will have a place in the house of the lord all my days
