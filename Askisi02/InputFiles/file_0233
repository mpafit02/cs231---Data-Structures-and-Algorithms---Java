 put in writing then the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which will be after these
 the secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lights are the seven churches
 and i saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven clothed with a cloud and an arch of coloured light was round his head and his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire
 and he had in his hand a little open book and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the earth
 and he gave a loud cry like the angry voice of a lion and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding
 and when the seven thunders had given out their voices i was about to put their words down and a voice from heaven came to my ears saying keep secret the things which the seven thunders said and do not put them in writing
 and the angel which i saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth put up his right hand to heaven
 and took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever who made the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it that there would be no more waiting
 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when the sound of his horn is about to come then will the secret of god be complete of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets
 and the voice came to me again from heaven saying go take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth
 and i went to the angel and said to him give me the little book and he said to me put it in your mouth and it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey
 and i took the little book out of the angels hand and did as he said and it was sweet as honey in my mouth and when i had taken it my stomach was made bitter
 and they said to me you are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings
 and there was given to me a measuring rod and one said go up and take the measure of the house of god and the altar and the worshippers in it
 but do not take the measure of the space outside the house because it has been given to the nations and the holy town will be under their feet for forty two months
 and i will give orders to my two witnesses and they will be prophets for a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed with haircloth
 these are the two olive trees and the two lights which are before the lord of the earth
 and if any man would do them damage fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them and if any man has a desire to do them damage in this way will he be put to death
 these have the power to keep the heaven shut so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets and they have power over the waters to make them into blood and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is
 and when they have come to the end of their witness the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death
 and their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town which in the spirit is named sodom and egypt where their lord was put to death on the cross
 and the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth
 and those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth
 and after three days and a half the breath of life from god went into them and they got up on their feet and great fear came on those who saw them
 and a great voice from heaven came to their ears saying to them come up here and they went up into heaven in the cloud and were seen by those desiring their death
 and in that hour there was a great earth shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction and in the earth shock seven thousand persons came to their end and the rest were in fear and gave glory to the god of heaven
 the second trouble is past see the third trouble comes quickly
 and at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he will have rule for ever and ever
 and the four and twenty rulers who are seated before god on their high seats went down on their faces and gave worship to god saying
 we give you praise o lord god ruler of all who is and who was because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom
