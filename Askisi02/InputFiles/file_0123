 he has to become greater while i become less
 he who comes from heaven is greater than all others he who comes from earth is of the earth and of the earth are his words he who comes from heaven is over all
 he gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears and no man takes his witness as true
 he who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that god is true
 for he whom god has sent says gods words and god does not give him the spirit by measure
 the father has love for the son and has put all things into his hands
 he who has faith in the son has eternal life but he who has not faith in the son will not see life gods wrath is resting on him
 now when it was clear to the lord that word had come to the ears of the pharisees that jesus was making more disciples than john and was giving them baptism
  though in fact it was his disciples who gave baptism not jesus himself 
 he went out of judaea into galilee again
 and it was necessary for him to go through samaria
 so he came to a town of samaria which was named sychar near to the bit of land which jacob gave to his son joseph
 now jacobs fountain was there jesus being tired after his journey was resting by the fountain it was about the sixth hour
 a woman of samaria came to get water and jesus said to her give me some water
 for his disciples had gone to the town to get food
 the woman of samaria said to him why do you a jew make a request for water to me a woman of samaria she said this because jews have nothing to do with the people of samaria
 in answer jesus said if you had knowledge of what god gives freely and who it is who says to you give me water you would make your prayer to him and he would give you living water
 the woman said to him sir you have no vessel and the fountain is deep from where will you get the living water
 are you greater than our father jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself with his children and his cattle
 jesus said to her everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again
 but whoever takes the water i give him will never be in need of drink again for the water i give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life
 the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it
 jesus said to her go get your husband and come back here with him
 in answer the woman said i have no husband jesus said to her you have said rightly i have no husband
 you have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband that was truly said
 the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
 our fathers gave worship on this mountain but you jews say that the right place for worship is in jerusalem
 jesus said to her woman take my word for this the time is coming when you will not give worship to the father on this mountain or in jerusalem
 you give worship but without knowledge of what you are worshipping we give worship to what we have knowledge of for salvation comes from the jews
 but the time is coming and is even now here when the true worshippers will give worship to the father in the true way of the spirit for these are the worshippers desired by the father
