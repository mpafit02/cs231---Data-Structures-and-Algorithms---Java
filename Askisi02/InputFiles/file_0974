 for fear that he may be angry causing destruction to come on you because he is quickly moved to wrath happy are all those who put their faith in him
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt may the lord give ear to you in the day of trouble may you be placed on high by the name of the god of jacob
 may he send you help from the holy place and give you strength from zion
 may he keep all your offerings in mind and be pleased with the fat of your burned offerings  selah 
 may he give you your hearts desire and put all your purposes into effect
 we will be glad in your salvation and in the name of our god we will put up our flags may the lord give you all your requests
 now am i certain that the lord gives salvation to his king he will give him an answer from his holy heaven with the strength of salvation in his right hand
 some put their faith in carriages and some in horses but we will be strong in the name of the lord our god
 they are bent down and made low but we have been lifted up
 come to our help lord let the king give ear to our cry
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt the king will be glad in your strength o lord how great will be his delight in your salvation 
 you have given him his hearts desire and have not kept back the request of his lips  selah 
 for you go before him with the blessings of good things you put a crown of fair gold on his head
 he made request to you for life and you gave it to him long life for ever and ever
 his glory is great in your salvation honour and authority have you put on him
 for you have made him a blessing for ever you have given him joy in the light of your face
 for the king has faith in the lord and through the mercy of the most high he will not be moved
 your hand will make a search for all your haters your right hand will be hard on all those who are against you
 you will make them like a flaming oven before you the lord in his wrath will put an end to them and they will be burned up in the fire
 their fruit will be cut off from the earth and their seed from among the children of men
 for their thoughts were bitter against you they had an evil design in their minds which they were not able to put into effect
 their backs will be turned when you make ready the cords of your bow against their faces
 be lifted up o lord in your strength so will we make songs in praise of your power
 &ltto the chief music maker on aijeleth hash shahar a psalm of david&gt my god my god why are you turned away from me why are you so far from helping me and from the words of my crying
 o my god i make my cry in the day and you give no answer and in the night and have no rest
 but you are holy o you who are seated among the praises of israel
 our fathers had faith in you they had faith and you were their saviour
 they sent up their cry to you and were made free they put their faith in you and were not put to shame
 but i am a worm and not a man cursed by men and looked down on by the people
 i am laughed at by all those who see me pushing out their lips and shaking their heads they say
