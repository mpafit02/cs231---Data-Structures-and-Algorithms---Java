 and she made an oath and said o lord of armies if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant not turning away from me but keeping me in mind and will give me a man child then i will give him to the lord all the days of his life and his hair will never be cut
 now while she was a long time in prayer before the lord eli was watching her mouth
 for hannahs prayer came from her heart and though her lips were moving she made no sound so it seemed to eli that she was overcome with wine
 and eli said to her how long are you going to be the worse for drink put away the effects of your wine from you
 and hannah answering him said no my lord i am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow i have not taken wine or strong drink but i have been opening my heart before the lord
 do not take your servant to be a good for nothing woman for my words have come from my stored up sorrow and pain
 then eli said to her go in peace and may the god of israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him
 and she said may your servant have grace in your eyes so the woman went away and took part in the feast and her face was no longer sad
 and early in the morning they got up and after worshipping before the lord they went back to ramah to their house and elkanah had connection with his wife and the lord kept her in mind
 now the time came when hannah being with child gave birth to a son and she gave him the name samuel because she said i made a prayer to the lord for him
 and the man elkanah with all his family went up to make the years offering to the lord and to give effect to his oath
 but hannah did not go for she said to her husband i will not go till the child has been taken from the breast and then i will take him with me and put him before the lord where he may be for ever
 and her husband elkanah said to her do whatever seems right to you but not till you have taken him from the breast only may the lord do as he has said so the woman waiting there gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast
 then when she had done so she took him with her with a three year old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine and took him to the house of the lord at shiloh now the child was still very young
 and when they had made an offering of the ox they took the child to eli
 and she said o my lord as your soul is living my lord i am that woman who was making a prayer to the lord here by your side
 my prayer was for this child and the lord has given him to me in answer to my request
 so i have given him to the lord for all his life he is the lords then he gave the lord worship there
 then samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on his head and gave him a kiss and said is not the lord with the holy oil making you ruler over israel his people and you will have authority over the people of the lord and you will make them safe from the hands of their attackers round about them and this will be the sign for you
 when you have gone away from me today you will see two men by the resting place of rachels body in the land of benjamin at zelzah and they will say to you the asses which you went in search of have come back and now your father caring no longer for the asses is troubled about you saying what am i to do about my son
 then you are to go on from there and when you come to the oak tree of tabor you will see three men going up to god to beth el one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine
 they will say peace be with you and will give you two cakes of bread which you are to take from them
 after that you will come to gibeah the hill of god where an armed force of the philistines is stationed and when you come to the town you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them and they will be acting like prophets
 and the spirit of the lord will come on you with power and you will be acting like a prophet with them and will be changed into another man
 and when these signs come to you see that you take the chance which is offered you for god is with you
 then you are to go down before me to gilgal where i will come to you for the offering of burned offerings and peace offerings go on waiting there for seven days till i come to you and make clear to you what you have to do
 and it came about that when he went away from samuel god gave him a changed heart and all those signs took place that day
 and when they came to gibeah a band of prophets came face to face with him and the spirit of god came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet
 now when sauls old friends saw him among the band of prophets the people said to one another what has come to saul the son of kish is even saul among the prophets
 and one of the people of that place said in answer and who is their father so it became a common saying is even saul among the prophets
