 and jesus says to them how much bread have you and they said seven cakes and some small fishes
 then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth
 and he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
 and they all took food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits seven baskets full
 and there were four thousand men who took food together with women and children
 and when he had sent the people away he got into the boat and came into the country of magadan
 and the pharisees and sadducees came and testing him made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven
 but in answer he said to them at nightfall you say the weather will be good for the sky is red
 and in the morning the weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry you are able to see the face of heaven but not the signs of the times
 an evil and false generation is searching after a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of jonah and he went away from them
 and when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread
 and jesus said to them take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
 and they were reasoning among themselves saying we took no bread
 and jesus seeing it said o you of little faith why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread
 do you still not see or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand and the number of baskets you took up
 or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand and the number of baskets you took up
 how is it that you do not see that i was not talking to you about bread but about keeping away from the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
 then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind but the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
 now when jesus had come into the parts of caesarea philippi he said questioning his disciples who do men say that the son of man is
 and they said some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
 he says to them but who do you say that i am
 and simon peter made answer and said you are the christ the son of the living god
 and jesus made answer and said to him a blessing on you simon bar jonah because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood but from my father in heaven
 and i say to you that you are peter and on this rock will my church be based and the doors of hell will not overcome it
 i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
 then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the christ
 from that time jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to jerusalem and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes and be put to death and the third day come again from the dead
 and peter protesting said to him be it far from you lord it is impossible that this will come about
 but he turning to peter said get out of my way satan you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of god but on the things of men
 then jesus said to his disciples if any man would come after me let him give up all and take up his cross and come after me
