 &ltto the chief music maker of david a psalm&gt when i was waiting quietly for the lord his heart was turned to me and he gave ear to my cry
 he took me up out of a deep waste place out of the soft and sticky earth he put my feet on a rock and made my steps certain
 and he put a new song in my mouth even praise to our god numbers have seen it with fear and put their faith in the lord
 happy is the man who has faith in the lord and does not give honour to the men of pride or to those who are turned away to deceit
 o lord my god great are the wonders which you have done in your thought for us it is not possible to put them out in order before you when i would give an account of them their number is greater than i may say
 you had no desire for offerings of beasts or fruits of the earth ears you made for me for burned offerings and sin offerings you made no request
 then i said see i come it is recorded of me in the roll of the book
 my delight is to do your pleasure o my god truly your law is in my heart
 i have given news of righteousness in the great meeting o lord you have knowledge that i have not kept back my words
 your righteousness has not been folded away in my heart i have made clear your true word and your salvation i have not kept secret your mercy or your faith from the great meeting
 take not away your gentle mercies from me o lord let your mercy and your faith keep me safe for ever
 for unnumbered evils are round about me my sins have overtaken me so that i am bent down with their weight they are more than the hairs of my head my strength is gone because of them
 be pleased o lord to take me out of danger o lord come quickly and give me help
 let those who go after my soul for its destruction have shame and trouble together let them be turned back and made foolish who take pleasure in my trouble
 let those who say to me aha aha  be surprised because of their shame
 let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you let the lovers of your salvation ever say may the lord be great
 though i am poor and in need the lord has me in mind you are my help and my saviour let there be no waiting o my god
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt happy is the man who gives thought to the poor the lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble
 the lord will keep him safe and give him life the lord will let him be a blessing on the earth and will not give him into the hand of his haters
 the lord will be his support on his bed of pain by you will all his grief be turned to strength
 i said lord have mercy on me make my soul well because my faith is in you
 my haters say evil against me when will he be dead and his name come to an end
 if one comes to see me deceit is in his heart he keeps a store of evil which he makes public in every place
 all my haters are talking secretly together against me they are designing my downfall
 they say he has an evil disease which will not let him go and now that he is down he will not get up again
 even my dearest friend in whom i had faith who took bread with me is turned against me
 but you o lord have mercy on me lifting me up so that i may give them their punishment
 by this i see that you have pleasure in me because my hater does not overcome me
 and as for me you are my support in my righteousness giving me a place before your face for ever
 may the lord god of israel be praised through eternal days and for ever so be it so be it
