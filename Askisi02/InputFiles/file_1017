 for all our days have gone by in your wrath our years come to an end like a breath
 the measure of our life is seventy years and if through strength it may be eighty years its pride is only trouble and sorrow for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone
 who has knowledge of the power of your wrath or who takes note of the weight of your passion
 so give us knowledge of the number of our days that we may get a heart of wisdom
 come back o lord how long let your purpose for your servants be changed
 in the morning give us your mercy in full measure so that we may have joy and delight all our days
 make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow and for the years in which we have seen evil
 make your work clear to your servants and your glory to their children
 let the pleasure of the lord our god be on us o lord give strength to the work of our hands
 happy is he whose resting place is in the secret of the lord and under the shade of the wings of the most high
 who says of the lord he is my safe place and my tower of strength he is my god in whom is my hope
 he will take you out of the bird net and keep you safe from wasting disease
 you will be covered by his feathers under his wings you will be safe his good faith will be your salvation
 you will have no fear of the evil things of the night or of the arrow in flight by day
 or of the disease which takes men in the dark or of the destruction which makes waste when the sun is high
 you will see a thousand falling by your side and ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you
 only with your eyes will you see the reward of the evil doers
 because you have said i am in the hands of the lord the most high is my safe resting place
 no evil will come on you and no disease will come near your tent
 for he will give you into the care of his angels to keep you wherever you go
 in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 you will put your foot on the lion and the snake the young lion and the great snake will be crushed under your feet
 because he has given me his love i will take him out of danger i will put him in a place of honour because he has kept my name in his heart
 when his cry comes up to me i will give him an answer i will be with him in trouble i will make him free from danger and give him honour
 with long life will he be rewarded and i will let him see my salvation
 &lta psalm a song for the sabbath&gt it is a good thing to give praise to the lord and to make melody to your name o most high
 to make clear your mercy in the morning and your unchanging faith every night
 on a ten corded instrument and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound
 for you o lord have made me glad through your work i will have joy in the works of your hands
 o lord how great are your works  and your thoughts are very deep
