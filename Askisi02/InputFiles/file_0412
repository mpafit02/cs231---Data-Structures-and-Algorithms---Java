 and the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people for it was said to the people the king is in bitter grief for his son
 and the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war
 but the king covering his face gave a great cry o my son absalom o absalom my son my son 
 and joab came into the house to the king and said today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death
 for your haters it seems are dear to you and your friends are hated for you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you and now i see that if absalom was living and we had all been dead today it would have been right in your eyes
 so get up now and go out and say some kind words to your servants for by the lord i give you my oath that if you do not go out not one of them will keep with you tonight and that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years
 then the king got up and took his seat near the town door and word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place and all the people came before the king now all the men of israel had gone back in flight to their tents
 and through all the tribes of israel the people were having arguments saying the king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the philistines and now he has gone in flight from the land because of absalom
 and absalom whom we made a ruler over us is dead in the fight so now why do you say nothing about getting the king back and word of what all israel was saying came to the king
 and king david sent word to zadok and abiathar the priests say to the responsible men of judah why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house
 you are my brothers my bone and my flesh why are you the last to get the king back again
 and say to amasa are you not my bone and my flesh may gods punishment be on me if i do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of joab 
 and the hearts of the men of judah were moved like one man so that they sent to the king saying come back with all your servants
 so the king came back and came as far as jordan and judah came to gilgal meeting the king there to take him back with them over jordan
 and shimei the son of gera the benjamite from bahurim got up quickly and went down with the men of judah for the purpose of meeting king david
 and with him a thousand men of benjamin and ziba the servant of saul with his fifteen sons and twenty servants came rushing to jordan before the king
 and kept going across the river to take the people of the kings house over and to do whatever was desired by the king and shimei the son of gera went down on his face in the dust before the king when he was about to go over jordan
 and said to him let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes o my lord and do not keep in mind the wrong i did on the day when my lord the king went out of jerusalem or take it to heart
 for your servant is conscious of his sin and so as you see i have come today the first of all the sons of joseph for the purpose of meeting my lord the king
 but abishai the son of zeruiah said is not death the right fate for shimei because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil
 and david said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah that you put yourselves against me today is it right for any man in israel to be put to death today for i am certain today that i am king in israel
 so the king said to shimei you will not be put to death and the king gave him his oath
 and mephibosheth the son of sauls son came down for the purpose of meeting the king his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace
 now when he had come from jerusalem to see the king the king said to him why did you not come with me mephibosheth
 and he said in answer because of the deceit of my servant my lord king for i your servant said to him you are to make ready an ass and on it i will go with the king for your servant has not the use of his feet
 he has given you a false account of me but my lord the king is like the angel of god do then whatever seems good to you
 for all my fathers family were only dead men before my lord the king and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the kings table what right then have i to say anything more to the king
 and the king said say nothing more about these things i say let there be a division of the land between ziba and you
 and mephibosheth said let him take it all now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace 
 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and he went on as far as jordan with the king to take him across jordan
