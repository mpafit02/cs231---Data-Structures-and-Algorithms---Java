 and when we were going to the place of prayer we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future whose masters made great profit from her power
 she came after paul and us crying out and saying these men are the servants of the most high god who are giving you news of the way of salvation
 and this she did on a number of days but paul was greatly troubled and turning said to the spirit i give you orders in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and it came out that very hour
 but when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone they took paul and silas pulling them into the market place before the rulers
 and when they had taken them before the authorities they said these men who are jews are greatly troubling our town
 teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep being romans
 and the people made an attack on them all together and the authorities took their clothing off them and gave orders for them to be whipped
 and when they had given them a great number of blows they put them in prison giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely
 and he having such orders put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet
 but about the middle of the night paul and silas were making prayers and songs to god in the hearing of the prisoners
 and suddenly there was an earth shock so that the base of the prison was moved and all the doors came open and everyones chains came off
 and the keeper coming out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open took his sword and was about to put himself to death fearing that the prisoners had got away
 but paul said in a loud voice do yourself no damage for we are all here
 and he sent for lights and came rushing in and shaking with fear went down on his face before paul and silas
 and took them out and said sirs what have i to do to get salvation
 and they said have faith in the lord jesus and you and your family will have salvation
 and they gave the word of the lord to him and to all who were in his house
 and that same hour of the night he took them and when he had given attention to their wounds he and all his family had baptism straight away
 and he took them into his house and gave them food and he was full of joy having faith in god with all his family
 but when it was day the authorities sent the police saying let these men go
 and the keeper said to paul the authorities have given orders to let you go come out now and go in peace
 but paul said to them they have given us who are romans a public whipping without judging us and have put us in prison will they now send us out secretly no truly let them come themselves and take us out
 and the police gave an account of these words to the authorities and they were full of fear on hearing that they were romans
 then they came and made prayers to them requesting them when they had taken them out to go away from the town
 and they came out of the prison and went to the house of lydia and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away
 now when they had gone through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
 and paul as he generally did went in to them and on three sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy writings
 saying to them clearly and openly that christ had to be put to death and come back to life again and that this jesus whom he said i am preaching to you is the christ
 and some of them had faith and were joined to paul and silas and a number of the god fearing greeks and some of the chief women
 but the jews being moved with envy took with them certain low persons from among the common people and getting together a great number of people made an outcry in the town attacking the house of jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people
