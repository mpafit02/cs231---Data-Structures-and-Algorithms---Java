 up  give cries in the night at the starting of the night watches let your heart be flowing out like water before the face of the lord lifting up your hands to him for the life of your young children who are falling down feeble for need of food at the top of every street
 look  o lord see to whom you have done this  are the women to take as their food the fruit of their bodies the children who are folded in their arms are the priest and the prophet to be put to death in the holy place of the lord
 the young men and the old are stretched on the earth in the streets my virgins and my young men have been put to the sword you have sent death on them in the day of your wrath causing death without pity
 as in the day of a holy meeting you have made fears come round me on every side and no one got away or was kept safe in the day of the lords wrath those who were folded in my arms whom i took care of have been sent to their destruction by my hater
 i am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath
 by him i have been made to go in the dark where there is no light
 truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day
 my flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken
 he has put up a wall against me shutting me in with bitter sorrow
 he has kept me in dark places like those who have been long dead
 he has put a wall round me so that i am not able to go out he has made great the weight of my chain
 even when i send up a cry for help he keeps my prayer shut out
 he has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways he has made my roads twisted
 he is like a bear waiting for me like a lion in secret places
 by him my ways have been turned on one side and i have been pulled in bits he has made me waste
 with his bow bent he has made me the mark for his arrows
 he has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body
 i have become the sport of all the peoples i am their song all the day
 he has made my life nothing but pain he has given me the bitter root in full measure
 by him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones and i am bent low in the dust
 my soul is sent far away from peace i have no more memory of good
 and i said my strength is cut off and my hope from the lord
 keep in mind my trouble and my wandering the bitter root and the poison
 my soul still keeps the memory of them and is bent down in me
 this i keep in mind and because of this i have hope
 it is through the lords love that we have not come to destruction because his mercies have no limit
 they are new every morning great is your good faith
 i said to myself the lord is my heritage and because of this i will have hope in him
 the lord is good to those who are waiting for him to the soul which is looking for him
 it is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the lord
