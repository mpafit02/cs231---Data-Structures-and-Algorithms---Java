 and when the seventh month came the children of israel were in their towns and all the people came together like one man into the wide place in front of the water doorway and they made a request to ezra the scribe that he would put before them the book of the law of moses which the lord had given to israel
 and ezra the priest put the law before the meeting of the people before the men and women and all those who were able to take it in on the first day of the seventh month
 he was reading it in the wide place in front of the water doorway from early morning till the middle of the day in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to take it in and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the law
 and ezra the scribe took his place on a tower of wood which they had made for the purpose and by his side were placed mattithiah and shema and anaiah and uriah and hilkiah and maaseiah on the right and on the left pedaiah and mishael and malchijah and hashum and hashbaddanah zechariah and meshullam
 and ezra took the book opening it before the eyes of all the people  for he was higher than the people  and when it was open all the people got to their feet
 and ezra gave praise to the lord the great god and all the people in answer said so be it so be it lifting up their hands and with bent heads they gave worship to the lord going down on their faces to the earth
 and jeshua and bani and sherebiah and jamin akkub shabbethai hodiah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites made the law clear to the people and the people kept in their places
 and they gave out the words of the book the law of god clearly and gave the sense of it so that their minds were able to take it in
 and nehemiah who was the tirshatha and ezra the priest and scribe and the levites who were the teachers of the people said to all the people this day is holy to the lord your god let there be no sorrow or weeping for all the people were weeping on hearing the words of the law
 then he said to them go away now and take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink and send some to him for whom nothing is made ready for this day is holy to our lord and let there be no grief in your hearts for the joy of the lord is your strong place
 so the levites made all the people quiet saying be quiet for the day is holy and do not give way to grief
 and all the people went away to take food and drink and to send food to others and to be glad because the words which were said to them had been made clear
 and on the second day the heads of families of all the people and the priests and the levites came together to ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the law
 and they saw that it was recorded in the law that the lord had given orders by moses that the children of israel were to have tents for their living places in the feast of the seventh month
 and that they were to give out an order and make it public in all their towns and in jerusalem saying go out to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives and of myrtle and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make tents as it says in the book
 and the people went out and got them and made themselves tents every one on the roof of his house and in the open spaces and in the open squares of the house of god and in the wide place of the water doorway and the wide place of the doorway of ephraim
 all the people who had been prisoners and had come back made tents and were living in them for from the time of jeshua the son of nun till that day the children of israel had not done so and there was very great joy
 and day by day from the first day till the last he was reading from the book of the law of god and they kept the feast for seven days and on the eighth day there was a holy meeting as it is ordered in the law
 now on the twenty fourth day of this month the children of israel came together taking no food and putting haircloth and dust on their bodies
 and the seed of israel made themselves separate from all the men of other nations publicly requesting forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers
 and for a fourth part of the day upright in their places they were reading from the book of the law of their god and for a fourth part of the day they were requesting forgiveness and worshipping the lord their god
 then jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani took their places on the steps of the levites crying in a loud voice to the lord their god
 then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabneiah sherebiah hodiah shebaniah and pethahiah said get up and give praise to the lord your god for ever and ever praise be to your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise
 you are the lord even you only you have made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their armies the earth and all things in it the seas and everything in them and you keep them from destruction and the armies of heaven are your worshippers
 you are the lord the god who took abram and made him yours guiding him from ur of the chaldees and gave him the name of abraham
 you saw that his heart was true to you and made an agreement with him to give the land of the canaanite the hittite the amorite and the perizzite and the jebusite and the girgashite even to give it to his seed and you have done what you said for righteousness is yours
 and you saw the trouble of our fathers in egypt and their cry came to your ears by the red sea
 and you did signs and wonders on pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for you saw how cruel they were to them so you got yourself a name as it is today
 by you the sea was parted before them so that they went through the sea on dry land and those who went after them went down into the deep like a stone into great waters
 and you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light on the way they were to go
