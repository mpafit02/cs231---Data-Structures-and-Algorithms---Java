 and judah came to the watchtower of the waste land and looking in the direction of the army they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth no living man was to be seen
 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them they saw beasts in great numbers and wealth and clothing and things of value more than they were able to take away all this they took for themselves and they were three days getting it away there was so much
 on the fourth day they all came together in the valley of blessing and there they gave blessing to the lord for which cause that place has been named the valley of blessing to this day
 then all the men of judah and jerusalem went back with jehoshaphat at their head coming back to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them glad over their haters
 so they came to jerusalem with corded instruments and wind instruments into the house of the lord
 and the fear of god came on all the kingdoms of the lands when they had news of how the lord made war on those who came against israel
 so the kingdom of jehoshaphat was quiet for the lord gave him rest on every side
 and jehoshaphat was king over judah he was thirty five years old when he became king and he was ruling for twenty five years in jerusalem his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
 he went in the ways of his father asa not turning away but doing right in the eyes of the lord
 the high places however were not taken away and the hearts of the people were still not true to the god of their fathers
 now as for the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last they are recorded in the words of jehu the son of hanani which were put in the book of the kings of israel
 after this jehoshaphat king of judah became friends with ahaziah king of israel who did much evil
 together they made ships to go to tarshish building them in ezion geber
 then the word of eliezer the prophet the son of dodavahu of mareshah came against jehoshaphat saying because you have let yourself be joined with ahaziah the lord has sent destruction on your works and the ships were broken and were not able to go to tarshish
 and jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david and jehoram his son became king in his place
 and he had brothers sons of jehoshaphat azariah jehiel zechariah azariah michael and shephatiah all these were sons of jehoshaphat king of israel
 and their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value as well as walled towns in judah but the kingdom he gave to jehoram because he was the oldest
 now when jehoram had taken his place over his fathers kingdom and had made his position safe he put all his brothers to death with the sword as well as some of the princes of israel
 jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years
 he went in the ways of the kings of israel and did as the family of ahab did for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 but it was not the lords purpose to send destruction on the family of david because of the agreement he had made with david when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever
 in his time edom made themselves free from the rule of judah and took a king for themselves
 then jehoram went over with his captains and all his war carriages  made an attack by night on the edomites whose forces were all round him  on the captains of the war carriages
 so edom made themselves free from the rule of judah to this day and at the same time libnah made itself free from his rule because he was turned away from the lord the god of his fathers
 and more than this he made high places in the mountains of judah teaching the people of jerusalem to go after false gods and guiding judah away from the true way
 and a letter came to him from elijah the prophet saying the lord the god of your father david says because you have not kept to the ways of your father jehoshaphat or the ways of asa king of judah
 but have gone in the way of the kings of israel and have made judah and the people of jerusalem go after false gods as the family of ahab did and because you have put to death your fathers sons your brothers who were better than yourself
 now truly the lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours
 and you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease
 then the philistines and the arabians who are by ethiopia were moved by the lord to make war on jehoram
