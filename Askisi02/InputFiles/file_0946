 but when their cry came to his ears he had pity on their trouble
 and kept in mind his agreement with them and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness
 he put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners
 be our saviour o lord our god and let us come back together from among the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
 praise be to the lord god of israel for ever and for ever and let all the people say so be it give praise to the lord
 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 let those whose cause the lord has taken up say so his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters
 making them come together out of all the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south
 they were wandering in the waste places they saw no way to a resting place
 their souls became feeble for need of food and drink
 then they sent up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
 guiding them in the right way so that they might come into the town of their resting place
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 he gives its desire to the unresting soul so that it is full of good things
 those who were in the dark in the black night in chains of sorrow and iron
 because they went against the words of god and gave no thought to the laws of the most high
 so that he made their hearts weighted down with grief they were falling and had no helper
 then they sent up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
 he took them out of the dark and the black night and all their chains were broken
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 the doors of brass are broken by his arm and the bands of iron are cut in two
 foolish men because of their sins and because of their wrongdoing are troubled
 they are disgusted by all food and they come near to the doors of death
 then they send up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
 he sent his word and made them well and kept them safe from the underworld
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 let them make offerings of praise giving news of his works with cries of joy
 those who go down to the sea in ships who do business in the great waters
 they see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
 for at his word comes up the storm wind lifting high the waves
