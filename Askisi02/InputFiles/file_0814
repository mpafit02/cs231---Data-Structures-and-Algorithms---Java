 you came near in the day when i made my prayer to you you said have no fear
 o lord you have taken up the cause of my soul you have made my life safe
 o lord you have seen my wrong be judge in my cause
 you have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me and all their designs against me
 their bitter words have come to your ears o lord and all their designs against me
 the lips of those who came up against me and their thoughts against me all the day
 take note of them when they are seated and when they get up i am their song
 you will give them their reward o lord answering to the work of their hands
 you will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them
 you will go after them in wrath and put an end to them from under the heavens of the lord
 how dark has the gold become  how changed the best gold  the stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street
 the valued sons of zion whose price was the best gold are looked on as vessels of earth the work of the hands of the potter 
 even the beasts of the waste land have full breasts they give milk to their young ones the daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the waste land
 the tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink the young children are crying out for bread and no man gives it to them
 those who were used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust
 for the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of sodom which was overturned suddenly without any hand falling on her
 her holy ones were cleaner than snow they were whiter than milk their bodies were redder than corals their form was as the sapphire
 their face is blacker than night in the streets no one has knowledge of them their skin is hanging on their bones they are dry they have become like wood
 those who have been put to the sword are better off than those whose death is caused by need of food for these come to death slowly burned up like the fruit of the field
 the hands of kind hearted women have been boiling their children they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people
 the lord has given full effect to his passion he has let loose his burning wrath he has made a fire in zion causing the destruction of its bases
 to the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the haters would go into the doors of jerusalem
 it is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil doing of her priests by whom the blood of the upright has been drained out in her
 they are wandering like blind men in the streets they are made unclean with blood so that their robes may not be touched by men
 away  unclean  they were crying out to them away  away  let there be no touching when they went away in flight and wandering men said among the nations there is no further resting place for them
 the face of the lord has sent them in all directions he will no longer take care of them they had no respect for the priests they gave no honour to the old men
 our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help we have been watching for a nation unable to give salvation
 they go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets our end is near our days are numbered for our end has come
 those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven driving us before them on the mountains waiting secretly for us in the waste land
 our breath of life he on whom the holy oil was put was taken in their holes of whom we said under his shade we will be living among the nations
