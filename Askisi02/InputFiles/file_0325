 then going away from the prophets he came to the house
 and sauls fathers brother said to him and his servant where have you been and he said searching for the asses and when we saw no sign of them we came to samuel
 then he said and what did samuel say to you
 and saul answering him said he gave us word that the asses had come back but he said nothing to him of samuels words about the kingdom
 then samuel sent for the people to come together before the lord at mizpah
 and he said to the children of israel the lord the god of israel has said i took israel out of egypt and made you free from the hands of the egyptians and from all the kingdoms which kept you down
 but today you are turned away from your god who himself has been your saviour from all your troubles and sorrows and you have said to him put a king over us so now take your places before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands
 so samuel made all the tribes of israel come near and the tribe of benjamin was taken
 then he made the tribe of benjamin come near by families and the family of the matrites was taken and from them saul the son of kish was taken but when they went in search of him he was nowhere to be seen
 so they put another question to the lord is the man present here and the answer of the lord was he is keeping himself from view among the goods
 so they went quickly and made him come out and when he took his place among the people he was taller by a head than any of the people
 and samuel said to all the people do you see the man of the lords selection how there is no other like him among all the people and all the people with loud cries said long life to the king 
 then samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom writing them in a book which he put in a safe place before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
 and saul went to gibeah to his house and with him went the men of war whose hearts had been touched by god
 but certain good for nothing persons said how is this man to be our saviour and having no respect for him they gave him no offering
 then about a month after this nahash the ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking jabesh gilead and all the men of jabesh said to nahash make an agreement with us and we will be your servants
 and nahash the ammonite said to them i will make an agreement with you on this condition that all your right eyes are put out so that i may make it a cause of shame to all israel
 then the responsible men of jabesh said to him give us seven days so that we may send men to every part of israel and then if no one comes to our help we will come out to you
 so they sent representatives to sauls town gibeah and these gave the news to the people and all the people gave themselves to weeping
 now saul came from the field driving the oxen before him and he said why are the people weeping and they gave him word of what the men of jabesh had said
 and at their words the spirit of god came on saul with power and he became very angry
 and he took two oxen and cutting them up sent them through all the land of israel by the hand of runners saying if any man does not come out after saul and samuel this will be done to his oxen and the fear of the lord came on the people and they came out like one man
 and he had them numbered in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand
 then he said to the representatives who had come say to the men of jabesh gilead tomorrow by the time the sun is high you will be made safe and the representatives came and gave the news to the men of jabesh and they were glad
 so the men of jabesh said tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you
 now on the day after saul put the people into three bands and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the ammonites and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direction so that no two of them were together
 and the people said to samuel who was it who said is saul to be our king give the men up so that we may put them to death
 and saul said not a man is to be put to death today for today the lord has made israel safe
 then samuel said to the people come let us go to gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of saul
 so all the people went to gilgal and there in gilgal they made saul king before the lord and peace offerings were offered before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel were glad with great joy
