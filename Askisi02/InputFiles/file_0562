 you are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns and on the four angles of the shelf and on the edge all round and you are to make it clean and free from sin
 and you are to take the ox of the sin offering and have it burned in the special place ordered for it in the house outside the holy place
 and on the second day you are to have a he goat without any mark on it offered for a sin offering and they are to make the altar clean as they did with the young ox
 and after you have made it clean let a young ox without a mark be offered and a male sheep from the flock without a mark
 and you are to take them before the lord and the priests will put salt on them offering them up for a burned offering to the lord
 every day for seven days you are to give a goat for a sin offering and let them give in addition a young ox and a male sheep from the flock without any mark on them
 for seven days they are to make offerings to take away sin from the altar and to make it clean so they are to make it holy
 and when these days have come to an end then on the eighth day and after the priests will make your burned offerings on the altar and your peace offerings and i will take pleasure in you says the lord
 and he took me back to the outer doorway of the holy place looking to the east and it was shut
 and the lord said to me this doorway is to be shut it is not to be open and no man is to go in by it because the lord the god of israel has gone in by it and it is to be shut
 but the ruler will be seated there to take his food before the lord he will go in by the covered way to the door and will come out by the same way
 and he took me to the north doorway in front of the house and looking i saw that the house of the lord was full of the glory of the lord and i went down on my face
 and the lord said to me son of man take to heart and let your eyes see and your ears be open to everything i say to you about all the rules of the house of the lord and all its laws and take note of the ways into the house and all the ways out of the holy place
 and say to the uncontrolled children of israel this is what the lord has said o you children of israel let it be enough for you among the disgusting things which you have done
 to have let men from strange lands without circumcision of heart or flesh come into my holy place making my house unclean and to have made the offering of my food even the fat and the blood and in addition to all your disgusting ways you have let my agreement be broken
 and you have not taken care of my holy things but you have put them as keepers to take care of my work in my holy place
 for this cause the lord has said no man from a strange land without circumcision of heart and flesh of all those who are living among the children of israel is to come into my holy place
 but as for the levites who went far from me when israel went out of the right way turning away from me to go after their images their punishment will come on them
 but they may be caretakers in my holy place and overseers at the doors of the house doing the work of the house they will put to death the burned offering and the beasts offered for the people and they will take their place before them as their servants
 because they did this work for them before their images and became a cause of sin to the children of israel for this cause my hand has been lifted up against them says the lord and their punishment will be on them
 and they will not come near me to do the work of priests to me or come near any of my holy things or the things which are most holy but their shame will be on them and the punishment for the disgusting things which they have done
 but i will make them responsible for the care of the house and all its work and everything which is done in it
 but as for the priests the sons of zadok who took care of my holy place when the children of israel were turned away from me they are to come near me to do my work they will take their places before me offering to me the fat and the blood says the lord
 they are to come into my holy place and they are to come near to my table to do my work and have the care of my house
 and when they come in by the doorways of the inner square they are to be clothed in linen robes there is to be no wool on them while they are doing my work in the doorway of the inner square and inside the house
 they are to have linen head dresses on their heads and linen trousers on their legs and they are to have nothing round them to make their skin wet with heat
 and when they go out into the outer square to the people they are to take off the robes in which they do the work of priests and put them away in the holy rooms and put on other clothing so that the people may not be made holy by their robes
 they are not to have all the hair cut off their heads and they are not to let their hair get long but they are to have the ends of their hair cut
 the priests are not to take wine when they go into the inner square
 and they are not to take as wives any widow or woman whose husband has put her away but they may take virgins of the seed of israel or a widow who is the widow of a priest
