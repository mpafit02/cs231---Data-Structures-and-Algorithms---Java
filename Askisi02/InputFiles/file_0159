 and pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let jesus go free
 but crying out they said to the cross with him 
 and he said to them a third time why what evil has he done i see no reason for putting him to death i will give him punishment and let him go
 but they went on crying out loudly let him be put to death on the cross and they had their way
 and pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect
 and in answer to their request he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death and jesus he gave up to their pleasure
 and while they were taking him away they put their hands on simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and made him take the cross after jesus
 and a great band of people went after him and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him
 but jesus turning to them said daughters of jerusalem let not your weeping be for me but for yourselves and for your children
 for the days are coming in which they will say happy are those who have had no children whose bodies have never given birth whose breasts have never given milk
 and they will say to the mountains come down on us and to the hills be a cover over us
 for if they do these things when the tree is green what will they do when it is dry
 and two others evil doers were taken with him to be put to death
 and when they came to the place which is named golgotha they put him on the cross and the evil doers one on the right side and the other on the left
 and jesus said father let them have forgiveness for they have no knowledge of what they are doing and they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
 and the people were looking on and the rulers made sport of him saying he was a saviour of others let him do something for himself if he is the christ the man of gods selection
 and the men of the army made sport of him coming to him and giving him bitter wine
 and saying if you are the king of the jews get yourself free
 and these words were put in writing over him this is the king of the jews
 and one of the evil doers on the cross with bitter feeling said to him are you not the christ get yourself and us out of this
 but the other protesting said have you no fear of god for you have a part in the same punishment
 and with reason for we have the right reward of our acts but this man has done nothing wrong
 and he said jesus keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom
 and he said to him truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise
 and it was now about the sixth hour and all the land was dark till the ninth hour
 the light of the sun went out and the curtain in the temple was parted in two
 and jesus gave a loud cry and said father into your hands i give my spirit and when he had said this he gave up his spirit
 and when the captain saw what was done he gave praise to god saying without doubt this was an upright man
 and all the people who had come together to see it when they saw the things which were done went back again making signs of grief
 and all his friends and the women who came with him from galilee were waiting at a distance watching these things
