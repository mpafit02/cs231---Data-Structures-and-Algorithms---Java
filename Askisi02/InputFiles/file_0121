 and after eight days his disciples were again in the house and thomas was with them though the doors were shut jesus came and taking his place in the middle of them he said may peace be with you 
 then he said to thomas put out your finger and see my hands and put your hand here into my side and be no longer in doubt but have belief
 and thomas said in answer my lord and my god 
 jesus said to him because you have seen me you have belief a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me 
 a number of other signs jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book
 but these are recorded so that you may have faith that jesus is the christ the son of god and so that having this faith you may have life in his name
 after these things jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of tiberias and it came about in this way
 simon peter thomas named didymus nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples were all together
 simon peter said to them i am going fishing they said to him and we will come with you they went out and got into the boat but that night they took no fish
 now very early in the morning jesus was there by the edge of the sea  though the disciples were not conscious that it was jesus 
 so jesus said to them children have you taken any fish they made answer no
 and he said to them let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some so they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish
 so the disciple who was dear to jesus said to peter it is the lord  hearing that it was the lord peter put his coat round him  because he was not clothed  and went into the sea
 and the other disciples came in the little boat  they were not far from land only about two hundred cubits off  pulling the net full of fish
 when they got to land they saw a fire of coals there with fish cooking on it and bread
 jesus said to them get some of the fish which you have now taken
 so peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land full of great fish a hundred and fifty three and though there was such a number the net was not broken
 jesus said to them come and take some food and all the disciples were in fear of putting the question who are you being conscious that it was the lord
 then jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and the fish in the same way
 now this was the third time that jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead
 then when they had taken food jesus said to simon peter simon son of john is your love for me greater than the love of these others he said to him yes lord you are certain of my love for you he said to him then give my lambs food
 again a second time he said to him simon son of john have you any love for me yes lord he said you are certain of my love for you then take care of my sheep said jesus
 he said to him a third time simon son of john am i dear to you now peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time am i dear to you and he said to him lord you have knowledge of all things you see that you are dear to me jesus said to him then give my sheep food
 truly i say to you when you were young you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go but when you are old you will put out your hands and another will make you ready and you will be taken where you have no desire to go
 now this he said pointing out the sort of death by which he would give god glory and after saying this he said to him come after me
 then peter turning round saw the disciple who was dear to jesus coming after them  the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal and said lord who is it who will be false to you
 seeing him peter said to jesus what about this man
 jesus said to him if it is my desire for him to be here till i come back what is that to you come yourself after me
 so this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death jesus however did not say that he would not undergo death but if it is my desire for him to be here till i come back what is that to you
 this is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing and we have knowledge that his witness is true
