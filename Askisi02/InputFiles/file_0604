 it is in my power to do you damage but the god of your father came to me this night saying take care that you say nothing good or bad to jacob
 and now it seems you are going because your hearts desire is for your fathers house but why have you taken my gods
 and jacob in answer said to laban my fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force
 as for your gods if anyone of us has them let him be put to death make search before us all for what is yours and take it for jacob had no knowledge that rachel had taken them
 so laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the tents of the two servant women but they were not there and he came out of leahs tent and went into rachels
 now rachel had taken the images and had put them in the camels basket and was seated on them and laban searching through all the tent did not come across them
 and she said to her father let not my lord be angry because i do not get up before you for i am in the common condition of women and with all his searching he did not come across the images
 then jacob was angry with laban and said what crime or sin have i done that you have come after me with such passion
 now that you have made search through all my goods what have you seen which is yours make it clear now before my people and your people so that they may be judges between us
 these twenty years i have been with you your sheep and your goats have had young without loss not one of your he goats have i taken for food
 anything which was wounded by beasts i did not take to you but myself made up for the loss of it you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves by day or by night
 this was my condition wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night and sleep went from my eyes
 these twenty years i have been in your house i was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters and for six years i kept your flock and ten times was my payment changed
 if the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had not been with me you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands but god has seen my troubles and the work of my hands and this night he kept you back
 then laban answering said these women are my daughters and these children my children the flocks and all you see are mine what now may i do for my daughters and for their children
 come let us make an agreement you and i and let it be for a witness between us
 then jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar
 and jacob said to his people get stones together and they did so and they had a meal there by the stones
 and the name laban gave it was jegar sahadutha but jacob gave it the name of galeed
 and laban said these stones are a witness between you and me today for this reason its name was galeed
 and mizpah for he said may the lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one anothers doings
 if you are cruel to my daughters or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters then though no man is there to see god will be the witness between us
 and laban said see these stones and this pillar which i have put between you and me
 they will be witness that i will not go over these stones to you and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me for any evil purpose
 may the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father be our judge then jacob took an oath by the fear of his father isaac
 and jacob made an offering on the mountain and gave orders to his people to take food so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain
 and early in the morning laban after kissing and blessing his daughters went on his way back to his country
 and on his way jacob came face to face with the angels of god
 and when he saw them he said this is the army of god so he gave that place the name of mahanaim
 now jacob sent servants before him to esau his brother in the land of seir the country of edom
