 to whom am i to give word witnessing so that they may take note see their ears are stopped and they are not able to give attention see the word of the lord has been a cause of shame to them they have no delight in it
 for this reason i am full of the wrath of the lord i am tired of keeping it in may it be let loose on the children in the street and on the band of the young men together for even the husband with his wife will be taken the old man with him who is full of days
 and their houses will be handed over to others their fields and their wives together for my hand will be stretched out against the people of the land says the lord
 for from the least of them even to the greatest everyone is given up to getting money from the prophet even to the priest everyone is working deceit
 and they have made little of the wounds of my people saying peace peace when there is no peace
 let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things they had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling when my punishment comes on them they will be made low says the lord
 this is what the lord has said take your place looking out on the ways make search for the old roads saying where is the good way and go in it that you may have rest for your souls but they said we will not go in it
 and i put watchmen over you saying give attention to the sound of the horn but they said we will not give attention
 so then give ear you nations and 
 give ear o earth see i will make evil come on this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not given attention to my words and they would have nothing to do with my law
 to what purpose does sweet perfume come to me from sheba and spices from a far country your burned offerings give me no pleasure your offerings of beasts are not pleasing to me
 for this reason the lord has said see i will put stones in the way of this people and the fathers and the sons together will go falling over them the neighbour and his friend will come to destruction
 the lord has said see a people is coming from the north country a great nation will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth
 bows and spears are in their hands they are cruel and have no mercy their voice is like the thunder of the sea and they go on horses everyone in his place like men going to the fight against you o daughter of zion
 the news of it has come to our ears our hands have become feeble trouble has come on us and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth
 go not out into the field or by the way for there is the sword of the attacker and fear on every side
 o daughter of my people put on haircloth rolling yourself in the dust give yourself to sorrow as for an only son with most bitter cries of grief for he who makes waste will come on us suddenly
 i have made you a tester among my people so that you may have knowledge of their way and put it to the test
 all of them are turned away going about with false stories they are brass and iron they are all workers of deceit
 the blower is blowing strongly the lead is burned away in the fire they go on heating the metal to no purpose for the evil doers are not taken away
 they will be named waste silver because the lord has given them up
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 take your place in the doorway of the lords house and give out this word there and say give ear to the word of the lord all you of judah who come inside these doors to give worship to the lord
 the lord of armies the god of israel says let your ways and your doings be changed for the better and i will let you go on living in this place
 put no faith in false words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these
 for if your ways and your doings are truly changed for the better if you truly give right decisions between a man and his neighbour
 if you are not cruel to the man from a strange country and to the child without a father and to the widow and do not put the upright to death in this place or go after other gods causing damage to yourselves
 then i will let you go on living in this place in the land which i gave to your fathers in the past and for ever
 see you put your faith in false words which are of no profit
 will you take the goods of others put men to death and be untrue to your wives and take false oaths and have perfumes burned to the baal and go after other gods which are strange to you
