 and awaking from his wine noah saw what his youngest son had done to him and he said
 cursed be canaan let him be a servant of servants to his brothers
 and he said praise to the lord the god of shem let canaan be his servant
 may god make japheth great and let his living place be in the tents of shem and let canaan be his servant
 and noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters
 all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty and he came to his end
 the word which habakkuk the prophet saw
 how long o lord will your ears be shut to my voice i make an outcry to you about violent behaviour but you do not send salvation
 why do you make me see evil doing and why are my eyes fixed on wrong for wasting and violent acts are before me and there is fighting and bitter argument
 for this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected for the upright man is circled round by evil doers because of which right is twisted
 see among the nations and take note and be full of wonder for in your days i am doing a work in which you will have no belief even if news of it is given to you
 for see i am sending the chaldaeans that bitter and quick moving nation who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living places which are not theirs
 they are greatly to be feared their right comes from themselves
 and their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves they come from far away like an eagle in flight rushing on its food
 they are coming all of them with force the direction of their faces is forward the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea
 he makes little of kings rulers are a sport to him all the strong places are to be laughed at for he makes earthworks and takes them
 then his purpose will be changed over stepping the limit he will make his strength his god
 are you not eternal o lord my god my holy one for you there is no death o lord he has been ordered by you for our punishment and by you o rock he has been marked out to put us right
 before your holy eyes sin may not be seen and you are unable to put up with wrong why then are your eyes on the false why do you say nothing when the evil doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself
 he has made men like the fishes of the sea like the worms which have no ruler over them
 he takes them all up with his hook he takes them in his net getting them together in his fishing net for which cause he is glad and full of joy
 for this reason he makes an offering to his net burning perfume to his fishing net because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat
 for this cause his net is ever open and there is no end to his destruction of the nations
 i will take my position and be on watch placing myself on my tower looking out to see what he will say to me and what answer he will give to my protest
 and the lord gave me an answer and said put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones so that the reader may go quickly
 for the vision is still for the fixed time and it is moving quickly to the end and it will not be false even if it is slow in coming go on waiting for it because it will certainly come it will not be kept back
 as for the man of pride my soul has no pleasure in him but the upright man will have life through his good faith
 a curse on the cruel and false one  the man full of pride who never has enough who makes his desires wide as the underworld  he is like death he is never full but he makes all nations come to him getting all peoples together to himself
 will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him and say a curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors 
 will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you and your troublers get up from their sleep and you will be to them like goods taken in war
