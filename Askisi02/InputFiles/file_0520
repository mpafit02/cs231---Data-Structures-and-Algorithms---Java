 and the gold altar and the holy oil and the sweet perfume for burning and the curtain for the doorway of the tent
 and the brass altar with its network of brass and its rods and all its vessels and the washing vessel and its base
 the hangings for the open space with the pillars and their bases and the curtain for the doorway and the cords and nails and all the instruments necessary for the work of the house of the tent of meeting
 the robes for use in the holy place and the holy robes for aaron and his sons when acting as priests
 the children of israel did everything as the lord had given orders to moses
 then moses when he saw all their work and saw that they had done everything as the lord had said gave them his blessing
 and moses answering said it is certain that they will not have faith in me or give ear to my voice for they will say you have not seen the lord
 and the lord said to him what is that in your hand and he said a rod
 and he said put it down on the earth and he put it down on the earth and it became a snake and moses went running from it
 and the lord said to moses put out your hand and take it by the tail  and he put out his hand and took a grip of it and it became a rod in his hand 
 so that they may be certain that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob has been seen by you
 then the lord said to him again put your hand inside your clothing and he put his hand inside his robe and when he took it out it was like the hand of a leper as white as snow
 and he said put your hand inside your robe again  and he put his hand into his robe again and when he took it out he saw that it had become like his other flesh 
 and if they do not have faith in you or give ear to the voice of the first sign they will have faith in the second sign
 and if they have no faith even in these two signs and will not give ear to your voice then you are to take the water of the nile and put it on the dry land and the water you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land
 and moses said to the lord o lord i am not a man of words i have never been so and am not now even after what you have said to your servant for talking is hard for me and i am slow of tongue
 and the lord said to him who has made mans mouth who takes away a mans voice or hearing or makes him seeing or blind is it not i the lord
 so go now and i will be with your mouth teaching you what to say
 and he said o lord send if you will by the hand of anyone whom it seems good to you to send
 and the lord was angry with moses and said is there not aaron your brother the levite to my knowledge he is good at talking and now he is coming out to you and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart
 let him give ear to your voice and you will put my words in his mouth and i will be with your mouth and with his teaching you what you have to do
 and he will do the talking for you to the people he will be to you as a mouth and you will be to him as god
 and take in your hand this rod with which you will do the signs
 and moses went back to jethro his father in law and said to him let me go back now to my relations in egypt and see if they are still living and jethro said to moses go in peace
 and the lord said to moses in midian go back to egypt for all the men are dead who were attempting to take your life
 and moses took his wife and his sons and put them on an ass and went back to the land of egypt and he took the rod of god in his hand
 and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you do before pharaoh all the wonders which i have given you power to do but i will make his heart hard and he will not let the people go
 and you are to say to pharaoh the lord says israel is the first of my sons
 and i said to you let my son go so that he may give me worship and you did not let him go so now i will put the first of your sons to death
 now on the journey at the nights resting place the lord came in his way and would have put him to death
