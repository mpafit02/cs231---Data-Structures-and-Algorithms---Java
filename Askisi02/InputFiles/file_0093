 by faith noah being moved by the fear of god made ready an ark for the salvation of his family because god had given him news of things which were not seen at the time and through it the world was judged by him and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith
 by faith abraham did as god said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage and went out without knowledge of where he was going
 by faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement as in a strange land living in tents with isaac and jacob who had a part with him in the same heritage
 for he was looking for the strong town whose builder and maker is god
 and by faith sarah herself had power to give birth when she was very old because she had faith in him who gave his word
 so that from one man who was near to death came children in number as the stars in heaven or as the sand by the seaside which may not be numbered
 all these came to their end in faith not having had the heritage but having seen it with delight far away they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth
 for those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves
 and truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out they would have had chances of turning back
 but now their desire is for a better country that is to say for one in heaven and so it is no shame to god to be named their god for he has made ready a town for them
 by faith abraham made an offering of isaac when he was tested and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body
 of whom it had been said from isaac will your seed take their name
 judging that god was able to give life even to the dead and because of this he did get him back as if from death
 by faith isaac blessing jacob and esau gave news of things to come
 by faith jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of joseph when he was near to death and gave god worship supported by his stick
 by faith joseph when his end was near said that the children of israel would go out of egypt and gave orders about his bones
 by faith moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth because they saw that he was a fair child and they had no fear of the kings orders
 by faith moses when he became a man had no desire to be named the son of pharaohs daughter
 feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of god than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin
 judging a part in the shame of christ to be better than all the wealth of egypt for he was looking forward to his reward
 by faith he went out of egypt not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king for he kept on his way as seeing him who is unseen
 by faith he kept the passover and put the sign of the blood on the houses so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death
 by faith they went through the red sea as if it had been dry land though the egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same
 by faith the walls of jericho came down after they had been circled for seven days
 by faith rahab the loose woman was not put to death with those who had gone against gods orders because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land
 what more am i to say for there would not be time to give the stories of gideon barak samson and jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets
 who through faith overcame kingdoms did righteousness got their reward kept the mouths of lions shut
 put out the power of fire got safely away from the edge of the sword were made strong when they had been feeble became full of power in war and put to flight the armies of the nations
 women had their dead given back to them living others let themselves be cruelly attacked having no desire to go free so that they might have a better life to come
 and others were tested by being laughed at or by blows and even with chains and prisons
