 so let no one take pride in men for all things are yours
 paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours
 and you are christs and christ is gods
 let us be judged as servants of christ and as those who are responsible for the secret things of god
 and it is right for such servants to be safe persons
 but it is a small thing to me that i am judged by you or by mans judging i am not even a judge of myself
 for i am not conscious of any wrong in myself but this does not make me clear for it is the lord who is my judge
 for this reason let there be no judging before the time till the lord comes who will make clear the secret things of the dark and the designs of the heart and then will every man have his praise from god
 my brothers it is because of you that i have taken apollos and myself as examples of these things so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy writings so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother
 for who made you better than your brother or what have you that has not been given to you but if it has been given to you what cause have you for pride as if it had not been given to you
 for even now you are full even now you have wealth you have been made kings without us truly i would be glad if you were kings so that we might be kings with you
 for it seems to me that god has put us the apostles last of all as men whose fate is death for we are put on view to the world and to angels and to men
 we are made to seem foolish for christ but you are wise in christ we are feeble but you are strong you have glory but we have shame
 even to this hour we are without food drink and clothing we are given blows and have no certain resting place
 and with our hands we do the hardest work when they give us curses we give blessings when we undergo punishment we take it quietly
 when evil things are said about us we give gentle answers we are made as the unclean things of the world as that for which no one has any use even till now
 i am not saying these things to put you to shame but so that as my dear children you may see what is right
 for even if you had ten thousand teachers in christ you have not more than one father for in christ jesus i have given birth to you through the good news
 so my desire is that you take me as your example
 for this cause i have sent timothy to you who is my dear and true child in the lord he will make clear to you my ways in christ even as i am teaching everywhere in every church
 now some are full of pride as if i was not coming to you
 but i will come to you in a short time if it is pleasing to the lord and i will take note not of the word of those who are full of pride but of the power
 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power
 what is your desire is my coming to be with punishment or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit
 it is said in fact that there is among you a sin of the flesh such as is not seen even among the gentiles that one of you has his fathers wife
 and in place of feeling sorrow you are pleased with yourselves so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you
 for i myself being present in spirit though not in body have come to a decision about him who has done this thing
 in the name of our lord jesus when you have come together with my spirit with the power of our lord jesus
 that this man is to be handed over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the lord jesus
 this pride of yours is not good do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass
