 then esther the queen answering said if i have your approval o king and if it is the kings pleasure let my life be given to me in answer to my prayer and my people at my request
 for we are given up i and my people to destruction and death and to be cut off if we had been taken as men servants and women servants for a price i would have said nothing for our trouble is little in comparison with the kings loss
 then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart
 and esther said our hater and attacker is this evil haman then haman was full of fear before the king and the queen
 and the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden and haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to esther the queen for he saw that the kings purpose was evil against him
 then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking and haman was stretched out on the seat where esther was then the king said is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house and while the words were on the kings lips they put a cloth over hamans face
 then harbonah one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king said see the pillar fifty cubits high which haman made for mordecai who said a good word for the king is still in its place in hamans house then the king said put him to death by hanging him on it
 so haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for mordecai then the kings wrath became less
 that day the king gave all the family of haman the hater of the jews to esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had made clear what he was to her
 and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it to mordecai and esther put mordecai over the family of haman
 then esther again came before the king falling down at his feet and made request to him with weeping that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of haman the agagite and the designs which he had made against the jews
 then the king put out the rod of gold to esther and she got up before the king
 and she said if it is the kings pleasure and if i have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and i am pleasing to him then let letters be sent giving orders against those which haman the son of hammedatha the agagite sent out for the destruction of the jews in all divisions of the kingdom
 for how is it possible for me to see the evil which is to overtake my nation how may i see the destruction of my people
 then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen and to mordecai the jew see now i have given esther the family of haman and he has come to his death by hanging because he made an attack on the jews
 so now send a letter about the jews writing whatever seems good to you in the kings name and stamping it with the kings ring for a writing signed in the kings name and stamped with the kings ring may not be changed
 then at that time on the twenty third day of the third month which is the month sivan the kings scribes were sent for and everything ordered by mordecai was put in writing and sent to the jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from india to ethiopia a hundred and twenty seven divisions to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in their language and to the jews in their writing and their language
 the letters were sent in the name of king ahasuerus and stamped with his ring and they were taken by men on horseback going on the quick running horses used for the kings business the offspring of his best horses
 in these letters the king gave authority to the jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives and to send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women and to take their goods from them by force
 on one day in every division of the kingdom of ahasuerus that is on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar
 a copy of the writing to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom was given out to all the peoples so that the jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their haters
 so the men went out on the quick running horses used on the kings business wasting no time and forced on by the kings order and the order was given out in shushan the kings town
 and mordecai went out from before the king dressed in king like robes of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen and all the town of shushan gave loud cries of joy
 and the jews had light and joy and honour
 and in every part of the kingdom and in every town wherever the kings letter and his order came the jews were glad with great joy and had a feast and a good day and a great number of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews had come on them
 now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar when the time came for the kings order to be put into effect on the very day when the haters of the jews had been hoping to have rule over them though the opposite had come about and the jews had rule over their haters
 on that day the jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of ahasuerus for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them and everyone had to give way before them for the fear of them had come on all the peoples
 and all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the kings business gave support to the jews because the fear of mordecai had come on them
 for mordecai was great in the kings house and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom for the man mordecai became greater and greater
 so the jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do
