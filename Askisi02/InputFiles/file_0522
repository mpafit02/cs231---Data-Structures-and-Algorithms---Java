 the support for the lights he put in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side
 lighting the lights before the lord as the lord had given him orders
 and he put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil
 burning sweet perfumes on it as the lord had given him orders
 and he put up the curtain at the doorway of the house
 and at the door of the house of the tent of meeting he put the altar of burned offerings offering on it the burned offering and the meal offering as the lord had given him orders
 and between the altar and the tent of meeting he put the vessel with water in it for washing
 in it the hands and feet of moses and aaron and his sons were washed
 whenever they went into the tent of meeting and when they came near the altar as the lord had given orders to moses
 and he put up the hangings forming the open space round the house and the altar and put the curtain over the doorway so moses made the work complete
 then the cloud came down covering the tent of meeting and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 so that moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because the cloud was resting on it and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and whenever the cloud was taken up from the house the children of israel went forward on their journey
 but while the cloud was there they made no move till it was taken up
 for the cloud of the lord was resting on the house by day and at night there was fire in the cloud before the eyes of all the people of israel and so it was through all their journeys
 and after that moses and aaron came to pharaoh and said the lord the god of israel says let my people go so that they may keep a feast to me in the waste land
 and pharaoh said who is the lord to whose voice i am to give ear and let israel go i have no knowledge of the lord and i will not let israel go
 and they said the god of the hebrews has come to us let us then go three days journey into the waste land to make an offering to the lord our god so that he may not send death on us by disease or the sword
 and the king of egypt said to them why do you moses and aaron take the people away from their work get back to your work
 and pharaoh said truly the people of the land are increasing in number and you are keeping them back from their work
 the same day pharaoh gave orders to the overseers and those who were responsible for the work saying
 give these men no more dry stems for their brick making as you have been doing let them go and get the material for themselves
 but see that they make the same number of bricks as before and no less for they have no love for work and so they are crying out and saying let us go and make an offering to our god
 give the men harder work and see that they do it let them not give attention to false words
 and the overseers of the people and their responsible men went out and said to the people pharaoh says i will give you no more dry stems
 go yourselves and get dry stems wherever you are able for your work is not to be any less
 so the people were sent in all directions through the land of egypt to get dry grass for stems
 and the overseers went on driving them and saying do your full days work as before when there were dry stems for you
 and the responsible men of the children of israel whom pharaohs overseers had put over them were given blows and they said to them why have you not done your regular work in making bricks as before
 then the responsible men of the children of israel came to pharaoh protesting and saying why are you acting in this way to your servants
