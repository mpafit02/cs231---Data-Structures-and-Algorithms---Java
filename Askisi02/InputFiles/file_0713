 then it will come about that the sword which is the cause of your fear will overtake you there in the land of egypt and need of food which you are fearing will go after you there in egypt and there death will come to you
 such will be the fate of all the men whose minds are fixed on going into egypt and stopping there they will come to their end by the sword by being short of food and by disease not one of them will keep his life or get away from the evil which i will send on them
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said as my wrath and passion have been let loose on the people of jerusalem so will my passion be let loose on you when you go into egypt and you will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame and you will never see this place again
 the lord has said about you o last of judah go not into egypt be certain that i have given witness to you this day
 for you have been acting with deceit in your hearts for you sent me to the lord your god saying make prayer for us to the lord our god and give us word of everything he may say and we will do it
 and this day i have made it clear to you and you have not given ear to the voice of the lord your god in anything for which he has sent me to you
 and now be certain that you will come to your end by the sword and by being short of food and by disease in the place to which you are pleased to go for a living place
 and it came about that when jeremiah had come to the end of giving all the people the words of the lord their god which the lord their god had sent him to say to them even all these words
 then azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the men of pride said to jeremiah you have said what is false the lord our god has not sent you to say you are not to go into the land of egypt and make your living place there
 but baruch the son of neriah is moving you against us to give us up into the hands of the chaldaeans so that they may put us to death and take us away prisoners into babylon
 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people did not give ear to the order of the lord that they were to go on living in the land of judah
 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the rest of judah who had come back into the land of judah from all the nations where they had been forced to go
 the men and the women and the children and the kings daughters and every person whom nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah
 and they came into the land of egypt for they did not give ear to the voice of the lord and they came to tahpanhes
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah in tahpanhes saying
 take in your hand some great stones and put them in a safe place in the paste in the brickwork which is at the way into pharaohs house in tahpanhes before the eyes of the men of judah
 and say to them this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and he will put the seat of his kingdom on these stones which have been put in a safe place here by you and his tent will be stretched over them
 and he will come and overcome the land of egypt those who are for death will be put to death those who are to be prisoners will be made prisoners and those who are for the sword will be given to the sword
 and he will put a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and they will be burned by him and he will make egypt clean as a keeper of sheep makes clean his clothing and he will go out from there in peace
 and the stone pillars of beth shemesh in the land of egypt will be broken by him and the houses of the gods of egypt burned with fire
 the word which came to jeremiah about all the jews who were living in the land of egypt in migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said you have seen all the evil which i have sent on jerusalem and on all the towns of judah and now this day they are waste and unpeopled
 because of the evil which they have done moving me to wrath by burning perfumes in worship to other gods who were not their gods or yours or the gods of their fathers
 and i sent all my servants the prophets to you getting up early and sending them saying do not do this disgusting thing which is hated by me
 but they gave no attention and their ears were not open so that they might be turned from their evil doing and from burning perfume to other gods
 because of this my passion and my wrath were let loose burning in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are waste and unpeopled as at this day
 so now the lord the god of armies the god of israel has said why are you doing this great evil against yourselves causing every man and woman little child and baby at the breast among you in judah to be cut off till not one is still living
 moving me to wrath with the work of your hands burning perfumes to other gods in the land of egypt where you have gone to make a place for yourselves so that you may become a curse and a name of shame among all the nations of the earth
 have you no memory of the evil doing of your fathers and the evil doing of the kings of judah and the evil doing of their wives and the evil which you yourselves have done and the evil which your wives have done in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
 even to this day their hearts are not broken and they have no fear and have not gone in the way of my law or of my rules which i gave to you and to your fathers
