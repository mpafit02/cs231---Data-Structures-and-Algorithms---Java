 o nation full of sin a people weighted down with crime a generation of evil doers false hearted children they have gone away from the lord they have no respect for the holy one of israel their hearts are turned back from him
 why will you have more and more punishment why keep on in your evil ways every head is tired and every heart is feeble
 the body from head to foot is all diseased it is a mass of open wounds marks of blows and broken flesh the flow of blood has not been stopped and no oil has been put on the wounds
 your country has become waste your towns are burned with fire as for your land it is overturned before your eyes made waste and overcome by men from strange lands
 and the daughter of zion has become like a tent in a vine garden like a watchmans house in a field of fruit like a town shut in by armies
 if the lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe we would have been like sodom and the fate of gomorrah would have been ours
 give ear to the word of the lord you rulers of sodom let your hearts be turned to the law of our god you people of gomorrah
 what use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me says the lord your burned offerings of sheep and the best parts of fat cattle are a weariness to me i take no pleasure in the blood of oxen or of lambs or of he goats
 at whose request do you come before me making my house unclean with your feet
 give me no more false offerings the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me so are your new moons and sabbaths and your holy meetings
 your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul they are a weight in my spirit i am crushed under them
 and when your hands are stretched out to me my eyes will be turned away from you even though you go on making prayers i will not give ear your hands are full of blood
 be washed make yourselves clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes let there be an end of sinning
 take pleasure in well doing let your ways be upright keep down the cruel give a right decision for the child who has no father see to the cause of the widow
 come now and let us have an argument together says the lord how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow how may their dark purple seem like wool
 if you will give ear to my word and do it the good things of the land will be yours
 but if your hearts are turned against me i will send destruction on you by the sword so the lord has said
 the upright town has become untrue there was a time when her judges gave right decisions when righteousness had a resting place in her but now she is full of those who take mens lives
 your silver is no longer true metal your wine is mixed with water
 your chiefs have gone against the lord they have become friends of thieves every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them
 for this reason the lord the lord of armies the strong one of israel has said i will put an end to my haters and send punishment on those who are against me
 and my hand will again be on you washing away what is unclean as with soap and taking away all your false metal
 and i will give you judges again as at the first and wise guides as in the past then you will be named the town of righteousness the true town
 upright acts will be the price of zions forgiveness and by righteousness will men be living there
 but a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil doers together and those who have gone away from the lord will be cut off
 for you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire and because of the gardens of your pleasure
 for you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry and like a garden without water
 and the strong will be as food for the fire and his work as a flame and they will be burned together with no one to put out the fire
 cursed are those who make evil decisions and the writers who make the records of their cruel acts
 who do wrong to the poor in their cause and take away the right of the crushed among my people so that they may have the property of widows and get under their power those who have no father
