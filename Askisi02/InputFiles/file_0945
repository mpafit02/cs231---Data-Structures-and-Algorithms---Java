 they gave way to their evil desires in the waste land and put god to the test in the dry places
 and he gave them their request but sent a wasting disease into their souls
 they were full of envy against moses among the tents and against aaron the holy one of the lord
 the earth opening put an end to dathan covering up abiram and his band
 and a fire was lighted among their tents the sinners were burned up by the flames
 they made a young ox in horeb and gave worship to an image of gold
 and their glory was changed into the image of an ox whose food is grass
 they had no memory of god their saviour who had done great things in egypt
 works of wonder in the land of ham and things of fear by the red sea
 and he was purposing to put an end to them if moses his special servant had not gone up before him between him and his people turning back his wrath to keep them from destruction
 they were disgusted with the good land they had no belief in his word
 talking against him secretly in their tents they did not give ear to the voice of the lord
 so he made an oath against them to put an end to them in the waste land
 that their children might be mixed among the nations and sent away into other lands
 and they were joined to baal peor and took part in the offerings to the dead
 so they made him angry by their behaviour and he sent disease on them
 then phinehas got up and made prayer for them and the disease went no farther
 and all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever
 they made god angry again at the waters of meribah so that moses was troubled because of them
 for they made his spirit bitter and he said unwise things
 they did not put an end to the peoples as the lord had said
 but they were joined to the nations learning their works
 and they gave worship to images which were a danger to them
 they even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits
 and gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong offering them to the images of canaan and the land was made unclean with blood
 so they became unclean through their works going after their evil desires
 then the wrath of the lord was burning against his people and he was angry with his heritage
 and he gave them into the hands of the nations and they were ruled by their haters
 by them they were crushed and made low under their hands
 again and again he made them free but their hearts were turned against his purpose and they were overcome by their sins
