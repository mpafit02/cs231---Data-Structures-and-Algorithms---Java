 and joab gave david the number of all the people all the men of israel able to take up arms were one million one hundred thousand men and those of judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men able to take up arms
 but levi and benjamin were not numbered among them for joab was disgusted with the kings order
 and god was not pleased with this thing so he sent punishment on israel
 then david said to god great has been my sin in doing this but now be pleased to take away the sin of your servant for i have done very foolishly
 then the word of the lord came to gad davids seer saying
 go and say to david the lord says three things are offered to you say which of them you will have so that i may do it to you
 so gad came to david and said to him the lord says take whichever you will
 three years when there will not be enough food or three months of war when you will go in flight before your haters being in great danger of the sword or three days of the sword of the lord disease in the land and the angel of the lord taking destruction through all the land of israel now give thought to the answer i am to take back to him who sent me
 and david said to gad this is a hard decision for me to make let me come into the hands of the lord for great are his mercies let me not come into the hands of men
 so the lord sent disease on israel causing the death of seventy thousand men
 and god sent an angel to jerusalem for its destruction and when he was about to do so the lord saw and had regret for the evil and said to the angel of destruction it is enough do no more now the angel of the lord was by the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 and david lifting up his eyes saw the angel of the lord there between earth and heaven with an uncovered sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the responsible men clothed in haircloth went down on their faces
 and david said to god was it not i who gave the order for the people to be numbered it is i who have done the sin and the great wrong but these are only sheep what have they done let your hand o lord god be lifted up against me and against my family but not against your people to send disease on them
 then the angel of the lord gave orders to gad to say to david that he was to go and put up an altar to the lord on the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 and david went up as gad had said in the name of the lord
 and ornan turning back saw the angel and his four sons who were with him went to a secret place now ornan was crushing his grain
 and when david came ornan looking saw him and came out from the grain floor and went down on his face to the earth before him
 then david said to ornan give me the place where this grain floor is so that i may put up an altar here to the lord let me have it for its full price so that this disease may be stopped among the people
 and ornan said to david take it and let my lord the king do what seems right to him see i give you the oxen for burned offerings and the grain cleaning instruments for fire wood and the grain for the meal offering i give it all
 and king david said to ornan no i will certainly give you the full price for it because i will not take for the lord what is yours or give a burned offering without payment
 so david gave ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place
 and david put up an altar there to the lord offering burned offerings and peace offerings with prayers to the lord and he gave him an answer from heaven sending fire on the altar of burned offering
 then the lord gave orders to the angel and he put back his sword into its cover
 at that time when david saw that the lord had given him an answer on the grain floor of ornan the jebusite he made an offering there
 for the house of the lord which moses had made in the waste land and the altar of burned offerings were at that time in the high place at gibeon
 but david was not able to go before it to get directions from the lord so great was his fear of the sword of the angel of the lord
 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar for israels burned offerings
 and david gave orders to get together all the men from strange lands who were in the land of israel and he put stone cutters to work cutting stones for building the house of god
 and he got together a great store of iron for the nails for the doors and for the joins and brass more in weight than might be measured
 and cedar trees without number for the zidonians and the men of tyre came with a great amount of cedar trees for david
