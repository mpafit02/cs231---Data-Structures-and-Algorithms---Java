 and put noble kings to death for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 sihon king of the amorites for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and og king of bashan for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and gave their land to his people for a heritage for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 even a heritage for his servant israel for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 who kept us in mind when we were in trouble for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and has taken us out of the hands of our haters for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 who gives food to all flesh for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 o give praise to the god of heaven for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 by the rivers of babylon we were seated weeping at the memory of zion
 hanging our instruments of music on the trees by the waterside
 for there those who had taken us prisoners made request for a song and those who had taken away all we had gave us orders to be glad saying give us one of the songs of zion
 how may we give the lords song in a strange land
 if i keep not your memory o jerusalem let not my right hand keep the memory of its art
 if i let you go out of my thoughts and if i do not put jerusalem before my greatest joy let my tongue be fixed to the roof of my mouth
 o lord keep in mind against the children of edom the day of jerusalem how they said let it be uncovered uncovered even to its base
 o daughter of babylon whose fate is destruction happy is the man who does to you what you have done to us
 happy is the man who takes your little ones crushing them against the rocks
 &ltof david&gt i will give you praise with all my heart i will make melody to you before the gods
 i will give worship before your holy temple praising your name for your mercy and for your unchanging faith for you have made your word greater than all your name
 when my cry came to your ears you gave me an answer and made me great with strength in my soul
 all the kings of the earth will give you praise o lord when the words of your mouth come to their ears
 they will make songs about the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord
 though the lord is high he sees those who are low and he has knowledge from far off of those who are lifted up
 even when trouble is round me you will give me life your hand will be stretched out against the wrath of my haters and your right hand will be my salvation
 the lord will make all things complete for me o lord your mercy is eternal do not give up the works of your hands
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt o lord you have knowledge of me searching out all my secrets
 you have knowledge when i am seated and when i get up you see my thoughts from far away
 you keep watch over my steps and my sleep and have knowledge of all my ways
 for there is not a word on my tongue which is not clear to you o lord
