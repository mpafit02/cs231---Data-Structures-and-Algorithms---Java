 so elijah went to let ahab see him now there was no food to be had in samaria
 and ahab sent for obadiah the controller of the kings house  now obadiah had the fear of the lord before him greatly
 for when jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the lord obadiah took a hundred of them and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water 
 and ahab said to obadiah come let us go through all the country to all the fountains of water and all the rivers and see if there is any grass to be had for the horses and the transport beasts so that we may be able to keep some of the beasts from destruction
 so they went through all the country covering it between them ahab went in one direction by himself and obadiah went in another by himself
 and while obadiah was on his way he came face to face with elijah and seeing who it was he went down on his face and said is it you my lord elijah
 and elijah in answer said it is i now go and say to your lord elijah is here
 and he said what sin have i done that you would give up your servant into the hand of ahab and be the cause of my death
 by the life of the lord your god there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you and when they said he is not here he made them take an oath that they had not seen you
 and now you say go say to your lord elijah is here
 and straight away when i have gone from you the spirit of the lord will take you away i have no idea where so that when i come and give word to ahab and he sees you not he will put me to death though i your servant have been a worshipper of the lord from my earliest years
 has my lord not had word of what i did when jezebel was putting the lords prophets to death how i kept a hundred of them in a secret hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water
 and now you say go and say to your lord elijah is here and he will put me to death
 and elijah said by the life of the lord of armies whose servant i am i will certainly let him see me today
 so obadiah went to ahab and gave him the news and ahab went to see elijah
 and when he saw elijah ahab said to him is it you you troubler of israel
 then he said in answer i have not been troubling israel but you and your family because turning away from the orders of the lord you have gone after the baals
 now send and get israel together before me at mount carmel with the four hundred and fifty prophets of baal who get their food at jezebels table
 so ahab sent for all the children of israel and got the prophets together at mount carmel
 and elijah came near to all the people and said how long will you go on balancing between two opinions if the lord is god then give worship to him but if baal give worship to him and the people said not a word in answer
 then elijah said to the people i even i am the only living prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men
 now let them give us two oxen and let them take one for themselves and have it cut up and put it on the wood but put no fire under it i will get the other ox ready and put it on the wood and put no fire under it
 and do you make prayers to your god and i will make a prayer to the lord and it will be clear that the one who gives an answer by fire is god and all the people in answer said it is well said
 then elijah said to the prophets of baal take one ox for yourselves and get it ready first for there are more of you and make your prayers to your god but put no fire under
 so they took the ox which was given them and made it ready crying out to baal from morning till the middle of the day and saying o baal give ear to us but there was no voice and no answer and they were jumping up and down before the altar they had made
 and in the middle of the day elijah made sport of them saying give louder cries for he is a god he may be deep in thought or he may have gone away for some purpose or he may be on a journey or by chance he is sleeping and has to be made awake
 so they gave loud cries cutting themselves with knives and swords as was their way till the blood came streaming out all over them
 and from the middle of the day they went on with their prayers till the time of the offering but there was no voice or any answer or any who gave attention to them
 then elijah said to all the people come near to me and all the people came near and he put up again the altar of the lord which had been broken down
 and elijah took twelve stones the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob to whom the lord had said israel will be your name
