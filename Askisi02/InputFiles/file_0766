 and the children of judah and the children of jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the greeks to send them far away from their land
 see i will have them moved from the place where you have sent them and will let what you have done come back on your head
 i will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of judah for a price and they will give them for a price to the men of sheba a nation far off for the lord has said it
 give this out among the nations make ready for war get the strong men awake let all the men of war come near let them come up
 get your plough blades hammered into swords and your vine knives into spears let the feeble say i am strong
 come quickly all you nations round about and get yourselves together there make your strong ones come down o lord
 let the nations be awake and come to the valley of jehoshaphat for there i will be seated as judge of all the nations round about
 put in the blade for the grain is ready come get you down for the wine crusher is full the vessels are overflowing for great is their evil doing
 masses on masses in the valley of decision  for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision
 the sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
 and the lord will be thundering from zion and his voice will be sounding from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth will be shaking but the lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of israel
 and you will be certain that i am the lord your god living in zion my holy mountain and jerusalem will be holy and no strange person will ever again go through her
 and it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine and the hills will be flowing with milk and all the streams of judah will be flowing with water and a fountain will come out from the house of the lord watering the valley of acacia trees
 egypt will be a waste and edom a land of destruction because of the evil done to the children of judah because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause
 but judah will be peopled for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation
 and i will send punishment for their blood for which punishment has not been sent for the lord is living in zion
 and the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amittai saying
 up  go to nineveh that great town and let your voice come to it for their evil doing has come up before me
 and jonah got up to go in flight to tarshish away from the lord and he went down to joppa and saw there a ship going to tarshish so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to tarshish away from the lord
 and the lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken
 then the sailors were full of fear every man crying to his god and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less but jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep
 and the ships captain came to him and said to him what are you doing sleeping up  say a prayer to your god if by chance god will give a thought to us so that we may not come to destruction
 and they said to one another come let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us so they did so and jonah was seen to be the man
 then they said to him now make clear to us what is your work and where you come from what is your country and who are your people
 and he said to them i am a hebrew a worshipper of the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the dry land
 and the men were in great fear and they said to him what is this you have done for the men had knowledge of his flight from the lord because he had not kept it from them
 and they said to him what are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us for the sea was getting rougher and rougher
 and he said to them take me up and put me into the sea and the sea will become calm for you for i am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you
 and the men were working hard to get back to the land but they were not able to do so for the sea got rougher and rougher against them
 so crying to the lord they said give ear to our prayer o lord give ear and do not let destruction overtake us because of this mans life do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause for you o lord have done what seemed good to you
