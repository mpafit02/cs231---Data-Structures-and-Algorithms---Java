 and the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house but it was not moved because it was based on the rock
 and everyone to whom my words come and who does them not will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand
 and the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house and it came down and great was its fall
 and it came about when jesus had come to the end of these words that the people were surprised at his teaching
 for he was teaching as one having authority and not as their scribes
 and when he had come down from the mountain great numbers of people came after him
 and a leper came and gave him worship saying lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
 and he put his hand on him saying it is my pleasure be clean and straight away he was made clean
 and jesus said to him see that you say nothing about this to anyone but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by moses for a witness to them
 and when jesus was come into capernaum a certain captain came to him with a request
 saying lord my servant is ill in bed at the house with no power in his body and in great pain
 and he said to him i will come and make him well
 and the captain in answer said lord i am not good enough for you to come under my roof but only say the word and my servant will be made well
 because i myself am a man under authority having under me fighting men and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
 and when these words came to the ears of jesus he was surprised and said to those who came after him truly i say to you i have not seen such great faith no not in israel
 and i say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west and will take their seats with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 but the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark and there will be weeping and cries of pain
 and jesus said to the captain go in peace as your faith is so let it be done to you and the servant was made well in that hour
 and when jesus had come into peters house he saw his wifes mother in bed very ill
 and he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her and she got up and took care of his needs
 and in the evening they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits and he sent the spirits out of them with a word and made well all who were ill
 so that the word of isaiah the prophet might come true he himself took our pains and our diseases
 now when jesus saw a great mass of people about him he gave an order to go to the other side
 and there came a scribe and said to him master i will come after you wherever you go
 and jesus said to him the foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have a resting place but the son of man has nowhere to put his head
 and another of the disciples said to him lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
 but jesus said to him come after me and let the dead take care of their dead
 and when he had got into a boat his disciples went after him
 and there came up a great storm in the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves but he was sleeping
 and they came to him and awaking him said help lord destruction is near
