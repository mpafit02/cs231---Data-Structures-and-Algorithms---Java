 and a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep some to eternal life and some to eternal shame
 and those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever
 but as for you o daniel let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased
 then i daniel looking saw two others one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side
 and i said to the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river how long will it be to the end of these wonders
 then in my hearing the man clothed in linen who was over the river lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time times and a half and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end all these things will be ended
 and the words came to my ears but the sense of them was not clear to me then i said o my lord what is the sense of these things
 and he said go on your way daniel for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end
 till a number are tested and make themselves clean and the evil doers will do evil for not one of the evil doers will have knowledge but all will be made clear to those who are wise
 and from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away and an unclean thing causing fear is put up there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days
 a blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty five days
 but you go on your way and take your rest for you will be in your place at the end of the days
 in the second year of the rule of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar had dreams and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him
 then the king gave orders that the wonder workers and the users of secret arts and those who made use of evil powers and the chaldaeans were to be sent for to make clear to the king his dreams so they came and took their places before the king
 and the king said to them i have had a dream and my spirit is troubled by the desire to have the dream made clear to me
 then the chaldaeans said to the king in the aramaean language o king have life for ever give your servants an account of your dream and we will make clear to you the sense of it
 the king made answer and said to the chaldaeans this is my decision if you do not make clear to me the dream and the sense of it you will be cut in bits and your houses made waste
 but if you make clear the dream and the sense of it you will have from me offerings and rewards and great honour so make clear to me the dream and the sense of it
 a second time they said in answer let the king give his servants an account of his dream and we will make clear the sense
 the king made answer and said i am certain that you are attempting to get more time because you see that my decision is fixed
 that if you do not make my dream clear to me there is only one fate for you for you have made ready false and evil words to say before me till the times are changed so give me an account of the dream and i will be certain that you are able to make the sense of it clear
 then the chaldaeans said to the king in answer there is not a man on earth able to make clear the kings business for no king however great his power has ever made such a request to any wonder worker or user of secret arts or chaldaean
 the kings request is a very hard one and there is no other who is able to make it clear to the king but the gods whose living place is not with flesh
 because of this the king was angry and full of wrath and gave orders for the destruction of all the wise men of babylon
 so the order went out that the wise men were to be put to death and they were looking for daniel and his friends to put them to death
 then daniel gave an answer with wisdom and good sense to arioch the captain of the kings armed men who had gone out to put to death the wise men of babylon
 he made answer and said to arioch o captain of the king why is the kings order so cruel then arioch gave daniel an account of the business
 and daniel went in and made a request to the king to give him time and he would make clear the sense of his dream to the king
 and daniel went to his house and gave his friends hananiah mishael and azariah the news
 so that they might make a request for the mercy of the god of heaven in the question of this secret so that daniel and his friends might not come to destruction with the rest of the wise men of babylon
