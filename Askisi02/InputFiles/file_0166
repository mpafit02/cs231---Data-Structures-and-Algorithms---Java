 and no man having had old wine has any desire for new for he says the old is better
 now it came about that on the sabbath he was going through the fields of grain and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food crushing them in their hands
 but some of the pharisees said why do you do what it is not right to do on the sabbath
 and jesus said have you not seen in the writings what david did when he was in need of food he and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
 and he said the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
 and it came about on another sabbath that he went into the synagogue and was teaching there and a man was there whose right hand was dead
 and the scribes and pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the sabbath so that they might be able to say something against him
 but he had knowledge of their thoughts and he said to the man whose hand was dead get up and come into the middle and he got up and came forward
 and jesus said i put the question to you is it right to do good on the sabbath or to do evil to give life or to take it away
 and looking round on all of them he said to him put out your hand and he did so and his hand was made well
 but they were full of wrath and were talking together about what they might do to jesus
 and it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer and he was all night in prayer to god
 and the day came and turning to his disciples he made a selection from among them of twelve to whom he gave the name of apostles
 simon to whom he gave the name of peter and andrew his brother and james and john and philip and bartholomew
 and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and simon who was named the zealot
 and judas the son of james and judas iscariot he who was false to him
 and he came down with them to a level place and a great band of his disciples and a very great number of people from all judaea and jerusalem and from the parts of tyre and sidon by the sea came to give hearing to him and to be made well from their diseases
 and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well
 and all the people were desiring to be touched by him for power came from him and made them all well
 and turning his eyes to his disciples he said happy are you who are poor for the kingdom of god is yours
 happy are you who are in need of food now for you will be made full happy are you who are weeping now for you will be glad
 happy are you when men have hate for you and put you away from among them and say angry words to you turning away in disgust at your name because of the son of man
 be glad in that day and be lifted up for joy for your reward in heaven will be great for their fathers did these same things to the prophets
 but unhappy are you who have wealth for you have been comforted now
 unhappy are you who are full of food now for you will be in need unhappy are you who are laughing now for you will be crying in sorrow
 unhappy are you when all men give you their approval for so their fathers did to the false prophets
 but i say to you who give ear to me have love for those who are against you do good to those who have hate for you
 give blessing to those who give you curses say prayers for those who are cruel to you
 if a man gives you a blow on one side of your face then let the other side be turned to him from him who takes away your coat do not keep back your robe
