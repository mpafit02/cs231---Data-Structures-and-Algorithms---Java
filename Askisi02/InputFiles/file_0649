 and i will have you forced out of your place of authority and pulled down from your position
 and in that day i will send for my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah
 and i will put your robe on him and put your band about him and i will give your authority into his hand and he will be a father to the men of jerusalem and to the family of judah
 and i will give the key of the family of david into his care and what he keeps open will be shut by no one and what he keeps shut no one will make open
 and i will put him like a nail in a safe place and he will be for a seat of glory to his fathers family
 and all the glory of his fathers family will be hanging on him all their offspring every small vessel even the cups and the basins
 in that day says the lord of armies will the nail fixed in a safe place give way and it will be cut down and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off for the lord has said it
 the word about tyre let a cry of sorrow go up o ships of tarshish because your strong place is made waste on the way back from the land of kittim the news is given to them
 send out a cry of grief you men of the sea land traders of zidon who go over the sea whose representatives are on great waters
 who get in the seed of shihor whose wealth is the trade of the nations
 be shamed o zidon for the sea the strong place of the sea has said i have not been with child or given birth i have not taken care of young men or kept watch over the growth of virgins
 when the news comes to egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of tyre
 go over to tarshish give cries of sorrow o men of the sea land
 is this the town which was full of joy whose start goes back to times long past whose wanderings took her into far off countries
 by whom was this purposed against tyre the crowning town whose traders are chiefs whose business men are honoured in the land
 it was the purpose of the lord of armies to put pride to shame to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth
 let your land be worked with the plough o daughter of tarshish there is no longer any harbour
 his hand is stretched out over the sea the kingdoms are shaking the lord has given orders about canaan to make waste its strong places
 and he said there is no more joy for you o crushed virgin daughter of zidon up  go over to kittim even there you will have no rest
 
 let a cry of sorrow go up o ships of tarshish because your strong place is made waste
 and it will be in that day that tyre will go out of mind for seventy years that is the days of one king after the end of seventy years it will be for tyre as in the song of the loose woman
 take an instrument of music go about the town o loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man make sweet melody with songs so that you may come back to mens minds
 and it will be after the end of seventy years that the lord will have mercy on tyre and she will go back to her trade acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
 and her goods and her trade will be holy to the lord they will not be kept back or stored up for her produce will be for those living in the lords land to give them food for their needs and fair clothing
 see the lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled he is turning it upside down and sending the people in all directions
 and it will be the same for the people as for the priest for the servant as for his master and for the woman servant as for her owner the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it
 the earth will be completely waste and without men for this is the word of the lord
 the earth is sorrowing and wasting away the world is full of grief and wasting away the high ones of the earth come to nothing
 the earth has been made unclean by those living in it because the laws have not been kept by them the orders have been changed and the eternal agreement has been broken
