 but now you go on glorying in your pride and all such glorying is evil
 the man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it to him it is sin
 come now you men of wealth give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you
 your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing
 your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you burning into your flesh you have put by your store in the last days
 see the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field is crying out against you and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the lord of armies
 you have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction
 you have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death he puts up no fight against you
 go on waiting calmly my brothers till the coming of the lord like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come
 be as calm in your waiting let your hearts be strong because the coming of the lord is near
 say no hard things against one another brothers so that you will not be judged see the judge is waiting at the doors
 take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble the prophets who gave to men the words of the lord
 we say that those men who have gone through pain are happy you have the story of job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the lord was full of pity and mercy in the end
 but most of all my brothers do not take oaths not by the heaven or by the earth or by any other thing but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not be judged
 is anyone among you in trouble let him say prayers is anyone glad let him make a song of praise
 is anyone among you ill let him send for the rulers of the church and let them say prayers over him putting oil on him in the name of the lord
 and by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well and he will be lifted up by the lord and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness
 so then make a statement of your sins to one another and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well the prayer of a good man is full of power in its working
 elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months
 and he made another prayer and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit
 my brothers if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error
 be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number
 from the first he was the word and the word was in relation with god and was god
 this word was from the first in relation with god
 all things came into existence through him and without him nothing was
 what came into existence in him was life and the life was the light of men
 and the light goes on shining in the dark it is not overcome by the dark
 there was a man sent from god whose name was john
 he came for witness to give witness about the light so that all men might have faith through him
 he himself was not the light he was sent to give witness about the light
