 but this man who was not of their family took the tenth from abraham and gave a blessing to him to whom god had given his undertaking
 but there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater
 now at the present time men over whom death has power take the tenth but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living
 and we may say that in abraham even levi who has a right to take the tenth part gave it
 because he was still in his fathers body when melchizedek came to him
 now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of levi  for the law was given to the people in connection with them  what need was there for another priest who was of the order of melchizedek and not of the order of aaron
 because if the priests are changed it is necessary to make a change in the law
 for he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar
 because it is clear that our lord comes out of judah and moses said nothing about priests from that tribe
 and this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like melchizedek
 that is to say not made by a law based on the flesh but by the power of a life without end
 for it has been witnessed of him you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 so the law which went before is put on one side because it was feeble and without profit
  because the law made nothing complete  and in its place there is a better hope through which we come near to god
 and as this is not without the taking of an oath
  for those were made priests without an oath but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him the lord gave his oath which he will not take back that you are a priest for ever 
 by so much is it a better agreement which we have through jesus
 and it is true that there have been a great number of those priests because death does not let them go on for ever
 but this priest because his life goes on for ever is unchanging
 so that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to god through him because he is ever living to make prayer to god for them
 it was right for us to have such a high priest one who is holy and without evil doing no wrong having no part with sinners and made higher than the heavens
 who has no need to make offerings for sins every day like those high priests first for himself and then for the people because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself
 the law makes high priests of men who are feeble but the word of the oath which was made after the law gives that position to a son in whom all good is for ever complete
 now of the things we are saying this is the chief point we have such a high priest who has taken his place at the right hand of gods high seat of glory in heaven
 as a servant of the holy things and of the true tent which was put up by god not by man
 now every high priest is given authority to take to god the things which are given and to make offerings so that it is necessary for this man like them to have something for an offering
 if he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law
 being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven as moses when he was about to make the tent had special orders from god for see he said that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain
 but now his position as priest is higher because through him god has made a better agreement with man based on the giving of better things
 for if that first agreement had been as good as possible there would have been no place for a second
