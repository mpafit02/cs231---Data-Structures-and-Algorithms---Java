 you say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
 see now you are basing your hope on that broken rod of egypt which will go through a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is pharaoh king of egypt to all who put their faith in him
 and if you say to me our hope is in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and altars hezekiah has taken away saying to judah and jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in jerusalem
 and now take a chance with my master the king of assyria and i will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
 how then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in egypt for war carriages and horsemen
 and have i now come up to send destruction on this place without the lords authority it was the lord himself who said to me go up against this land and make it waste
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah said to the rab shakeh will you kindly make use of the aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
 but the rab shakeh said to them is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
 then the rab shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the jews language give ear to the words of the great king the king of assyria
 this is what the king says do not be tricked by hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
 and do not let hezekiah make you put your faith in the lord saying the lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 do not give ear to hezekiah for this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig tree and the water of his spring
 till i come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vine gardens a land of oil giving olives and of honey so that life and not death may be your fate give no attention to hezekiah when he says to you the lord will keep us safe
 has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of assyria
 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah have they kept samaria out of my hands
 who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hands to give cause for the thought that the lord will keep jerusalem from falling into my hands
 but the people kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was give him no answer
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came to hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the rab shakeh had said
 and on hearing it king hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the lord
 and he sent eliakim who was over the house and shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 and they said to him hezekiah says this day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
 it may be that the lord your god will give ear to the words of the rab shakeh whom the king of assyria his master sent to say evil things against the living god and will make his words come to nothing so then make your prayer for the rest of the people
 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
 and isaiah said to them this is what you are to say to your master the lord says be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of assyria have said against me in your hearing
 see i will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there i will have him put to death by the sword
 so the rab shakeh went back and when he got there the king of assyria was making war against libnah for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from lachish
 and when news came to him that tirhakah king of ethiopia had made an attack on him he sent representatives to hezekiah again saying
 this is what you are to say to hezekiah king of judah let not your god in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 no doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe
 did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden who were in telassar
