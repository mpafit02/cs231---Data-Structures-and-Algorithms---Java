 and i was looking for a man among them who would make up the wall and take his station in the broken place before me for the land so that i might not send destruction on it but there was no one
 and i let loose my passion on them and have put an end to them in the fire of my wrath i have made the punishment of their ways come on their heads says the lord
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man there were two women daughters of one mother
 they were acting like loose women in egypt when they were young their behaviour was loose there their breasts were crushed even the points of their young breasts were crushed
 their names were oholah the older and oholibah her sister and they became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters as for their names samaria is oholah and jerusalem oholibah
 and oholah was untrue to me when she was mine she was full of desire for her lovers even for the assyrians her neighbours
 who were clothed in blue captains and rulers all of them young men to be desired horsemen seated on horses
 and she gave her unclean love to them all of them the noblest men of assyria and she made herself unclean with the images of all who were desired by her
 and she has not given up her loose ways from the time when she was in egypt for when she was young they were her lovers and by them her young breasts were crushed and they let loose on her their unclean desire
 for this cause i gave her up into the hands of her lovers into the hands of the assyrians on whom her desire was fixed
 by these her shame was uncovered they took her sons and daughters and put her to death with the sword and she became a cause of wonder to women for they gave her the punishment which was right
 and her sister oholibah saw this but her desire was even more unmeasured and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister
 she was full of desire for the assyrians captains and rulers her neighbours clothed in blue horsemen going on horses all of them young men to be desired
 and i saw that she had become unclean the two of them went the same way
 and her loose behaviour became worse for she saw men pictured on a wall pictures of the chaldaeans painted in bright red
 with bands round their bodies and with head dresses hanging round their heads all of them looking like rulers like the babylonians the land of whose birth is chaldaea
 and when she saw them she was full of desire for them and sent servants to them in chaldaea
 and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and made her unclean with their loose desire and she became unclean with them and her soul was turned from them
 so her loose behaviour was clearly seen and her shame uncovered then my soul was turned from her as it had been turned from her sister
 but still she went on the more with her loose behaviour keeping in mind the early days when she had been a loose woman in the land of egypt
 and she was full of desire for her lovers whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses
 and she made the memory of the loose ways of her early years come back to mind when her young breasts were crushed by the egyptians
 for this cause o oholibah this is what the lord has said see i will make your lovers come up against you even those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust and i will make them come up against you on every side
 the babylonians and all the chaldaeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them young men to be desired captains and rulers all of them and chiefs her neighbours all of them on horseback
 and they will come against you from the north on horseback with war carriages and a great band of peoples they will put themselves in order against you with breastplate and body cover and metal head dress round about you and i will make them your judges and they will give their decision against you as seems right to them
 and my bitter feeling will be working against you and they will take you in hand with passion they will take away your nose and your ears and the rest of you will be put to the sword they will take your sons and daughters and the rest of you will be burned up in the fire
 and they will take all your clothing off you and take away your ornaments
 so i will put an end to your evil ways and your loose behaviour which came from the land of egypt and your eyes will never be lifted up to them again and you will have no more memory of egypt
 for this is what the lord has said see i will give you up into the hands of those who are hated by you into the hands of those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust
