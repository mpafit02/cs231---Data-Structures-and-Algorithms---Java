 for the lord has sent out from before you nations great and strong and they have all given way before you till this day
 one man of you is able to put to flight a thousand for it is the lord your god who is fighting for you as he has said to you
 so keep watch on yourselves and see that you have love for the lord your god
 for if you go back joining yourselves to the rest of these nations who are still among you getting married to them and living with them and they with you
 then you may be certain that the lord your god will not go on driving these nations out from before you but they will become a danger and a cause of sin to you a whip for your sides and thorns in your eyes till you are cut off from this good land which the lord your god has given you
 now i am about to go the way of all the earth and you have seen and are certain all of you in your hearts and souls that in all the good things which the lord said about you he has kept faith with you everything has come true for you
 and you will see that as all the good things which the lord your god undertook to do for you have come to you so the lord will send down on you all the evil things till he has made your destruction complete and you are cut off from the good land which the lord your god has given you
 if the agreement of the lord your god which was given to you by his orders is broken and you become the servants of other gods and give them worship then the wrath of the lord will be burning against you and you will quickly be cut off from the good land which he has given you
 then joshua got all the tribes of israel together at shechem and he sent for the responsible men of israel and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and they took their place before god
 and joshua said to all the people these are the words of the lord the god of israel in the past your fathers terah the father of abraham and the father of nahor were living on the other side of the river and they were worshipping other gods
 and i took your father abraham from the other side of the river guiding him through all the land of canaan i made his offspring great in number and gave him isaac
 and to isaac i gave jacob and esau to esau i gave mount seir as his heritage but jacob and his children went down to egypt
 and i sent moses and aaron troubling egypt by all the signs i did among them and after that i took you out
 i took your fathers out of egypt and you came to the red sea and the egyptians came after your fathers to the red sea with their war carriages and their horsemen
 and at their cry the lord made it dark between you and the egyptians and made the sea go over them covering them with its waters your eyes have seen what i did in egypt then for a long time you were living in the waste land
 and i took you into the lands of the amorites on the other side of jordan and they made war on you and i gave them into your hands and you took their land and i sent destruction on them before you
 then balak the son of zippor king of moab went up to war against israel and he sent for balaam the son of beor to put a curse on you
 but i did not give ear to balaam and so he went on blessing you and i kept you safe from him
 then you went over jordan and came to jericho and the men of jericho made war on you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites and the hivites and the jebusites and i gave them up into your hands
 and i sent the hornet before you driving out the two kings of the amorites before you not with your sword and your bow
 and i gave you a land on which you had done no work and towns not of your building and you are now living in them and your food comes from vine gardens and olive gardens not of your planting
 so now go in fear of the lord and be his servants with true hearts put away the gods worshipped by your fathers across the river and in egypt and be servants of the lord
 and if it seems evil to you to be the servants of the lord make the decision this day whose servants you will be of the gods whose servants your fathers were across the river or of the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but i and my house will be the servants of the lord
 then the people in answer said never will we give up the lord to be the servants of other gods
 for it is the lord our god who has taken us and our fathers out of the land of egypt out of the prison house and who did all those great signs before our eyes and kept us safe on all our journeys and among all the peoples through whom we went
 and the lord sent out from before us all the peoples the amorites living in the land so we will be the servants of the lord for he is our god
 and joshua said to the people you are not able to be the servants of the lord for he is a holy god a god who will not let his honour be given to another he will have no mercy on your wrongdoing or your sins
 if you are turned away from the lord and become the servants of strange gods then turning against you he will do you evil cutting you off after he has done you good
 and the people said to joshua no  but we will be the servants of the lord
 and joshua said to the people you are witnesses against yourselves that you have made the decision to be the servants of the lord and they said we are witnesses
