 in that day will this song be made in the land of judah we have a strong town he will make salvation our walls and towers
 let the doors be open so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in
 the man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace because his hope is in you
 let your hope be in the lord for ever for the lord jah is an unchanging rock
 for he has made low those who are lifted up all the people of the town of pride he makes it low crushing it down to the earth he makes it low in the dust
 it will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need
 the way of the good man is straight the road of the upright is made smooth by you
 we have been waiting for you o lord the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name
 in the night the desire of my soul has been for you early will my spirit be searching for you for when your punishments come on the earth the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness
 even if you are kind to the evil doer he will not go after righteousness even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing and will not see the glory of the lord
 lord your hand is lifted up but they do not see let them see  yes your haters will be burned up in the fire
 lord you will give us peace for all our works are the outcome of your purpose
 o lord our god other lords than you have had rule over us but in you only is our salvation and no other name will we take on our lips
 the dead will not come back to life their spirits will not come back to earth for this cause you have sent destruction on them so that the memory of them is dead
 you have made the nation great o lord you have made it great glory is yours you have made wide the limits of the land
 lord in trouble our eyes have been turned to you we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us
 as a woman with child whose time is near is troubled crying out in her pain so have we been before you o lord
 we have been with child we have been in pain we have given birth to wind no salvation has come to the earth through us and no children have come into the world
 your dead will come back their dead bodies will come to life again those in the dust awaking from their sleep will send out a song for your dew is a dew of light and the earth will give birth to the shades
 come my people into your secret places and let your doors be shut keep yourself safe for a short time till his wrath is over
 for the lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evil doing the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen and will keep her dead covered no longer
 in that day the lord with his great and strong and cruel sword will send punishment on leviathan the quick moving snake and on leviathan the twisted snake and he will put to death the dragon which is in the sea
 in that day it will be said a vine garden of delight make a song about it
 i the lord am watching it i will give it water at all times i will keep it night and day for fear that any damage comes to it
 my passion is over if the thorns were fighting against me i would make an attack on them and they would be burned up together
 or let him put himself under my power and make peace with me
 in days to come jacob will take root israel will put out buds and flowers and the face of the world will be full of fruit
 is his punishment like the punishment of those who overcame him or are his dead as great in number as those he put to the sword
 your anger against her has been made clear by driving her away he has taken her away with his storm wind in the day of his east wind
 so by this will the sin of jacob be covered and this is all the fruit of taking away his punishment when all the stones of the altar are crushed together so that the wood pillars and the sun images will not be put up again
