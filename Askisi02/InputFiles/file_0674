 and as for those from a strange country who are joined to the lord to give worship to him and honour to his name to be his servants even everyone who keeps the sabbath holy and keeps his agreement with me
 i will make them come to my holy mountain and will give them joy in my house of prayer i will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples
 the lord god who gets together the wandering ones of israel says i will get together others in addition to those of israel who have come back
 all you beasts of the field come together for your meat even all you beasts of the wood
 his watchmen are blind they are all without knowledge they are all dogs without tongues unable to make a sound stretched out dreaming loving sleep
 yes the dogs are for ever looking for food while these the keepers of the sheep are without wisdom they have all gone after their pleasure every one looking for profit they are all the same
 come they say i will get wine and we will take strong drink in full measure and tomorrow will be like today full of pleasure
 the upright man goes to his death and no one gives a thought to it and god fearing men are taken away and no one is troubled by it for the upright man is taken away because of evil doing and goes into peace
 they are at rest in their last resting places every one going straight before him
 but come near you sons of her who is wise in secret arts the seed of her who is false to her husband and of the loose woman
 of whom do you make sport against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out are you not uncontrolled children a false seed
 you who are burning with evil desire among the oaks under every green tree putting children to death in the valleys under the cracks of the rocks
 among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage they even they are your part even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me
 you have put your bed on a high mountain there you went up to make your offering
 and on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign for you have been false to me with another you have made your bed wide and made an agreement with them you had a desire for their bed where you saw it
 and you went to melech with oil and much perfume and you sent your representatives far off and went as low as the underworld
 you were tired with your long journeys but you did not say there is no hope you got new strength and so you were not feeble
 and of whom were you in fear so that you were false and did not keep me in mind or give thought to it have i not been quiet keeping myself secret and so you were not in fear of me
 i will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works you will have no profit in them
 your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry but the wind will take them they will be gone like a breath but he who puts his hope in me will take the land and will have my holy mountain as his heritage
 and i will say make it high make it high get ready the way take the stones out of the way of my people
 for this is the word of him who is high and lifted up whose resting place is eternal whose name is holy my resting place is in the high and holy place and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit to give life to the spirit of the poor and to make strong the heart of the crushed
 for i will not give punishment for ever or be angry without end for from me breath goes out and i it was who made the souls
 i was quickly angry with his evil ways and sent punishment on him veiling my face in wrath and he went on turning his heart from me
 i have seen his ways and i will make him well i will give him rest comforting him and his people who are sad
 i will give the fruit of the lips peace peace to him who is near and to him who is far off says the lord and i will make him well
 but the evil doers are like the troubled sea for which there is no rest and its waters send up earth and waste
 there is no peace says my god for the evil doers
 make a loud cry do not be quiet let your voice be sounding like a horn and make clear to my people their evil doings and to the family of jacob their sins
 though they make prayer to me every day and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways like a nation which has done righteousness and has not given up the rules of their god they make requests to me for the right orders it is their delight to come near to god
