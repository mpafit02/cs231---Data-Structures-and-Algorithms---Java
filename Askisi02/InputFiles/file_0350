 but the servant said in answer i have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver i will give that to the man of god and he will give us directions about our way
  in the past in israel when a man went to get directions from god he said come let us go to the seer for he who now is named prophet was in those days given the name of seer 
 then saul said to his servant you have said well come let us go so they went to the town where the man of god was
 and when they were on the way up to the town they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them is the seer here
 and they said he is in fact he is before you go quickly now for he has come into the town today for the people are making an offering in the high place today
 when you come into the town you will see him straight away before he goes up to the high place for the feast the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast and after that the guests will take part in it so go up now and you will see him
 so they went up to the town and when they came inside the town samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place
 now the day before saul came the word of god had come to samuel saying
 tomorrow about this time i will send you a man from the land of benjamin and on him you are to put the holy oil making him ruler over my people israel and he will make my people safe from the hands of the philistines for i have seen the sorrow of my people whose cry has come up to me
 and when samuel saw saul the lord said to him this is the man of whom i gave you word  he it is who is to have authority over my people
 then saul came up to samuel in the doorway of the town and said give me directions if you will be so good to the house of the seer
 then samuel said to saul i am the seer go up before me to the high place and take food with me today and in the morning i will let you go after opening to you all the secrets of your heart
 as for your asses which have been wandering for three days give no thought to them for they have come back and for whom are all the desired things in israel are they not for you and your fathers family
 and saul said am i not a man of benjamin the smallest of all the tribes of israel and my family the least of the families of benjamin why then do you say these words to me
 then samuel took saul and his servant into the guest room and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there about thirty persons
 and samuel said to the cook give me that part which i gave you orders to keep by you
 and the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it and put it before saul and samuel said this is the part which has been kept for you take it as your part of the feast because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present so that day saul took food with samuel
 and when they had come down from the high place into the town where a bed was made ready for saul he went to rest
 and about dawn samuel said to saul on the roof get up so that i may send you away so saul got up and he and samuel went out together
 and on their way down to the end of the town samuel said to saul give your servant orders to go on in front of us  so he went on  but you keep here so that i may give you the word of god
 and solomon the son of david made himself strong in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and made him very great
 and solomon sent word to all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all israel heads of their families
 then solomon and all the men of israel with him went to the high place at gibeon because the tent of meeting of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the waste land was there
 but the ark of god had been moved by david from kiriath jearim to the place which he had made ready for it for he had put up a tent for it at jerusalem
 and the altar of brass which bezalel the son of uri the son of hur had made was there before the tent of the lord and solomon and all the people went to give worship there
 and solomon went up there to the brass altar before the lord at the tent of meeting offering on it a thousand burned offerings
 in that night god came to solomon in a vision and said to him say what i am to give you
 and solomon said to god great was your mercy to david my father and you have made me king in his place
 now o lord god let your word to david my father come true for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number
 give me now wisdom and knowledge so that i may go out and come in before this people for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours
