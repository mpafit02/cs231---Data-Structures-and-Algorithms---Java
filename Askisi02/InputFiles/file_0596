 now isaacs love was for esau because esaus meat was greatly to his taste but rebekah had more love for jacob
 and one day jacob was cooking some soup when esau came in from the fields in great need of food
 and esau said to jacob give me a full meal of that red soup for i am overcome with need for food for this reason he was named edom
 and jacob said first of all give me your birthright
 and esau said truly i am at the point of death what profit is the birthright to me
 and jacob said first of all give me your oath and he gave him his oath handing over his birthright to jacob
 then jacob gave him bread and soup and he took food and drink and went away caring little for his birthright
 then came a time of great need in the land like that which had been before in the days of abraham and isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines at gerar
 and the lord came to him in a vision and said do not go down to egypt keep in the land of which i will give you knowledge
 keep in this land and i will be with you and give you my blessing for to you and to your seed will i give all these lands giving effect to the oath which i made to your father abraham
 i will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and will give them all these lands and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth
 because abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words my rules my orders and my laws
 so isaac went on living in gerar
 and when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife he said she is my sister fearing to say she is my wife for he said the men of the place may put me to death on account of rebekah because she is very beautiful
 and when he had been there for some time abimelech king of the philistines looking through a window saw isaac playing with rebekah his wife
 and he said to isaac it is clear that she is your wife why then did you say she is my sister and isaac said for fear that i might be put to death because of her
 then abimelech said what have you done to us one of the people might well have had connection with your wife and the sin would have been ours
 and abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching isaac or his wife was to be put to death
 now isaac planting seed in that land got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much for the blessing of the lord was on him
 and his wealth became very great increasing more and more
 for he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants so that the philistines were full of envy
 now all the water holes which his fathers servants had made in the days of abraham had been stopped up with earth by the philistines
 and abimelech said to isaac go away from us for you are stronger than we are
 so isaac went away from there and put up his tents in the valley of gerar making his living place there
 and he made again the water holes which had been made in the days of abraham his father and which had been stopped up by the philistines and he gave them the names which his father had given them
 now isaacs servants made holes in the valley and came to a spring of flowing water
 but the herdmen of gerar had a fight with isaacs herdmen for they said the spring is ours so he gave the spring the name of esek because there was a fight about it
 then they made another water hole and there was a fight about that so he gave it the name of sitnah
 then he went away from there and made another water hole about which there was no fighting so he gave it the name of rehoboth for he said now the lord has made room for us and we will have fruit in this land
 and from there he went on to beer sheba
