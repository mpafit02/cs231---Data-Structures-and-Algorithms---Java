 and let your food be barley cakes cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man
 and the lord said even so the children of israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where i am driving them
 then i said ah lord  see my soul has never been unclean and i have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts from the time when i was young even till now no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth
 then he said to me see i have given you cows waste in place of mans waste and you will make your bread ready on it
 and he said to me son of man see i will take away from jerusalem her necessary bread they will take their bread by weight and with care measuring out their drinking water with fear and wonder
 so that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another wasting away in their sin
 in the twenty fifth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the first month of the year on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after the town was taken on the very same day the hand of the lord was on me and he took me there
 in the visions of god he took me into the land of israel and put me down on a very high mountain on which there was as it seemed a building like a town opposite me
 he took me there and i saw a man looking like brass with a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod and he was stationed in the doorway
 and the man said to me son of man see with your eyes and give hearing with your ears and take to heart everything i am going to let you see for in order that i might let you see them you have come here and give an account of all you see to the children of israel
 and there was a wall on the outside of the house all round and in the mans hand there was a measuring rod six cubits long by a cubit and a hands measure so he took the measure of the building from side to side one rod and from base to top one rod
 then he came to the doorway looking to the east and went up by its steps and he took the measure of the doorstep one rod wide
 and the watchmens rooms were one rod long and one rod wide and the space between the rooms was five cubits the doorstep of the doorway by the covered way of the doorway inside was one rod
 and he took the measure of the covered way of the doorway inside
 eight cubits and its uprights two cubits the covered way of the doorway was inside
 and the rooms of the doorway on the east were three on this side and three on that all three were of the same size and the uprights on this side and on that were of the same size
 and he took the measure of the opening of the doorway ten cubits wide and the way down the doorway was thirteen cubits
 and the space in front of the rooms a cubit on this side and a cubit on that side and the rooms six cubits on this side and six cubits on that
 and he took the measure of the doorway from the back of one room to the back of the other twenty five cubits across from door to door
 and he took the measure of the covered way twenty cubits and opening from the covered way of the doorway was the open square round about
 and from before the opening of the doorway to before the inner covered way of the doorway was fifty cubits
 and the rooms and their uprights had sloping windows inside the doorway all round and in the same way the covered way had windows all round on the inside and on every upright there were palm trees
 then he took me into the outer square and there were rooms and a stone floor made for the open square all round there were thirty rooms on the stone floor
 and the stone floor was by the side of the doorways and was as wide as the doorways were long even the lower floor
 then he took the measure of the square across from before the lower doorway inside to before the inner doorway outside one hundred cubits and he took me in the direction of the north
 and there was a doorway to the outer square looking to the north and he took the measure of it to see how wide and how long it was
 and it had three rooms on this side of it and three on that its uprights and its covered ways were the same size as those of the first doorway it was fifty cubits long and twenty five cubits wide
 and its windows and the windows of its covered ways and its palm trees were the same as those of the doorway looking to the east and there were seven steps up to it and the covered way went inside
 and there was a doorway to the inner square opposite the doorway on the north like the doorway on the east and he took the measure from doorway to doorway a hundred cubits
 and he took me to the south and i saw a doorway looking to the south and he took the measure of its rooms and its uprights and its covered ways by these measures
