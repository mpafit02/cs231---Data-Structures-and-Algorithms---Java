 and isaiah said again to ahaz
 make a request to the lord your god for a sign a sign in the deep places of the underworld or in the high heavens
 but ahaz said i will not put the lord to the test by making such a request
 and he said give ear now o family of david is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust will you do the same to my god
 for this cause the lord himself will give you a sign a young woman is now with child and she will give birth to a son and she will give him the name immanuel
 butter and honey will be his food when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good
 for before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste
 the lord is about to send on you and on your people and on your fathers house such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of ephraim from judah even the coming of the king of assyria
 and it will be in that day that the lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of egypt and for the bee which is in the land of assyria
 and they will come covering all the waste valleys and the holes of the rocks and the thorns and all the watering places
 in that day will the lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet as well as the hair of the face with a blade got for a price from the other side of the river even with the king of assyria
 and it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep
 and they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land
 and it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns
 men will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns
 and they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade  fear of blackberries and thorns
 and the lord said to me take a great writing board and on it put down in common letters maher shalal hash baz
 and take true witnesses to the writing uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah
 and i went in to my wife and she became with child and gave birth to a son then the lord said to me give him the name maher shalal hash baz
 for before the child is able to say father or mother the wealth of damascus and the goods of samaria will be taken away by the king of assyria
 and the lord said again to me
 because this people will have nothing to do with the softly flowing waters of shiloah and have fear of rezin and remaliahs son
 for this cause the lord is sending on them the waters of the river deep and strong even the king of assyria and all his glory and it will come up through all its streams overflowing all its edges
 and it will come on into judah rushing on and overflowing till the waters are up to the neck *** and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side for god is with us
 have knowledge o peoples and be in fear give ear all you far off parts of the earth
 let your designs be formed and they will come to nothing give your orders and they will not be effected for god is with us
 for the lord controlling me with a strong hand gave me orders not to go in the way of this people saying
 do not say it is holy about everything of which this people says it is holy and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of
 but let the lord of armies be holy to you and go in fear of him giving honour to him
 and he will be for a holy place but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of israel and to the men of jerusalem for a net in which they may be taken
