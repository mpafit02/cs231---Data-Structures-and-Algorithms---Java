 when the men of israel saw the danger they were in  for the people were troubled  they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows
 and a great number of the people had gone over jordan to the land of gad and gilead but saul was still in gilgal and all the people went after him shaking in fear
 and he went on waiting there for seven days the time fixed by samuel but samuel did not come to gilgal and the people were starting to go away from him
 then saul said come here and give me the burned offering and the peace offerings and he made a burned offering to the lord
 and when the burned offering was ended samuel came and saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing
 and samuel said what have you done and saul said because i saw that the people were going away from me and you had not come at the time which had been fixed and the philistines had come together at michmash
 i said now the philistines will come down on me at gilgal and i have made no prayer for help to the lord and so forcing myself to do it i made a burned offering
 and samuel said to saul you have done a foolish thing you have not kept the rules which the lord your god gave you it was the purpose of the lord to make your authority over israel safe for ever
 but now your authority will not go on the lord searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way has given him the place of ruler over his people because you have not done what the lord gave you orders to do
 then samuel went up from gilgal and the rest of the people went up after saul against the men of war and they came from gilgal to gibeah in the land of benjamin and saul took the number of the people who were with him about six hundred men
 and saul with jonathan his son and the people who were with them was waiting in geba in the land of benjamin but the tents of the philistines were in michmash
 and three bands of men came out from the philistines to make an attack one band went by the road which goes to ophrah into the land of shual
 and another went in the direction of beth horon and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of zeboiim in the direction of the waste land
 now there was no iron worker in all the land of israel for the philistines said for fear the hebrews make themselves swords or spears
 but all the israelites had to go to the philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp
 for they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes and for putting iron points on their ox driving rods
 so on the day of the fight at michmash not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with saul and jonathan only saul and his son jonathan had them
 and the armed force of the philistines went out to the narrow way of michmash
 now one day jonathan the son of saul said to the young man who was with him looking after his arms come let us go over to the philistine force over there but he said nothing to his father
 and saul was still waiting in the farthest part of geba under the fruit tree in migron there were about six hundred men with him
 and ahijah the son of ahitub brother of ichabod the son of phinehas the son of eli the priest of the lord in shiloh who had the ephod and the people had no idea that jonathan had gone
 now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which jonathan was making his way to the philistines forces there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side one was named bozez and the other seneh
 the one rock went up on the north in front of michmash and the other on the south in front of geba
 and jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms come let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision it may be that the lord will give us help for there is no limit to his power the lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band
 and his servant said to him do whatever is in your mind see i am with you in every impulse of your heart
 then jonathan said now we will go over to these men and let them see us
 if they say to us keep quiet where you are till we come to you then we will keep our places and not go up to them
 but if they say come up to us then we will go up for the lord has given them into our hands and this will be the sign to us
 and they let the philistine force see the two of them and the philistines said look  the hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover
 and the armed men of the force gave jonathan and his servant their answer saying come up here to us and we will let you see something then jonathan said to his servant come up after me for the lord has given them up into the hands of israel
