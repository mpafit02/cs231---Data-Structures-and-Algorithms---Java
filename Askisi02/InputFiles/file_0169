 and he said two men were in debt to a certain man of business one had a debt of five hundred pence and the other of fifty
 when they were unable to make payment he made the two of them free of their debts which of them now will have the greater love for him
 simon in answer said it seems he whose debt was greater and he said your decision is right
 and turning to the woman he said to simon you see this woman i came into your house you did not give me water for my feet but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes and drying them with her hair
 you did not give me a kiss but she from the time when i came in has gone on kissing my feet
 you put no oil on my head but she has put perfume on my feet
 and so i say to you she will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number because of her great love but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love
 and he said to her you have forgiveness for your sins
 and those who were seated at table with him said to themselves who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins
 and he said to the woman by your faith you have salvation go in peace
 and it came about after a short time that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of god and with him were the twelve
 and certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases mary named magdalene from whom seven evil spirits had gone out
 and joanna the wife of chuza herods chief house servant and susanna and a number of others who gave him of their wealth for his needs
 and when a great number of people came together and men from every town went out to him he gave them teaching in the form of a story
 a man went out to put in seed and while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot and was taken by the birds of heaven
 and some went on the rock and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water
 and some went among thorns and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth
 and some falling on good earth came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much and with these words he said in a loud voice he who has ears let him give ear
 and his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story
 and he said to you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of god but to the others they are given in stories so that seeing they may not see and though they give hearing the sense will not be clear to them
 now this is the point of the story the seed is the word of god
 those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing then the evil one comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not have faith and get salvation
 and those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word but having no root they have faith for a time and when the test comes they give up
 and those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing and go on their way but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life and they give no fruit
 and those in the good earth are those who having given ear to the word keep it with a good and true heart and in quiet strength give fruit
 no man when the light is lighted puts a cover over it or puts it under a bed but he puts it on its table so that those who come in may see the light
 for nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light
 so take care how you give hearing for to him who has will be given and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have
 and his mother and his brothers came to him and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people
 and someone said to him your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you
