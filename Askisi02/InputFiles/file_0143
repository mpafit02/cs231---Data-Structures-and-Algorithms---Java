 and if after that it has fruit it is well if not let it be cut down
 and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
 and there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years she was bent and was not able to make herself straight
 and when jesus saw her he said to her woman you are made free from your disease
 and he put his hands on her and she was made straight and gave praise to god
 and the ruler of the synagogue was angry because jesus had made her well on the sabbath and he said to the people there are six days in which men may do work so come on those days to be made well and not on the sabbath
 but the lord gave him an answer and said o you false men  do you not every one of you on the sabbath let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water
 and is it not right for this daughter of abraham who has been in the power of satan for eighteen years to be made free on the sabbath
 and when he said these things those who were against him were shamed and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him
 then he said what is the kingdom of god like what comparison may i make of it
 it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden and it became a tree and the birds of heaven made their resting places in its branches
 and again he said what is the kingdom of god like
 it is like leaven which a woman put into three measures of meal and it was all leavened
 and he went on his way through towns and country places teaching and journeying to jerusalem
 and someone said to him lord will only a small number have salvation and he said to them
 do your best to go in by the narrow door for i say to you a number will make the attempt to go in but will not be able to do so
 when the master of the house has got up and the door has been shut and you still outside give blows on the door saying lord let us in he will make answer and say i have no knowledge of where you come from
 then you will say we have taken food and drink with you and you were teaching in our streets
 but he will say truly i have no knowledge of you or where you come from go away from me you workers of evil
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves are shut outside
 and they will come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south and take their places in the kingdom of god
 and the last will be first and the first will be last
 at that time certain pharisees came to him and said go away from this place because herods purpose is to put you to death
 and he said go and say to that fox i send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow and on the third day my work will be complete
 but i have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside jerusalem
 o jerusalem jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who were sent to her  again and again would i have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings but you would not 
 now see your house is waste and i say to you you will not see me again till you say a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 and it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees on the sabbath to have a meal they were watching him
 and a certain man was there who had a disease
 and jesus answering said to the scribes and pharisees is it right to make people well on the sabbath or not
