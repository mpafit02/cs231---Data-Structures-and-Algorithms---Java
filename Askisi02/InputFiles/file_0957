 my flesh is moved for fear of you i give honour to your decisions
 &ltain&gt i have done what is good and right you will not give me into the hands of those who are working against me
 take your servants interests into your keeping let me not be crushed by the men of pride
 my eyes are wasted with desire for your salvation and for the word of your righteousness
 be good to your servant in your mercy and give me teaching in your rules
 i am your servant give me wisdom so that i may have knowledge of your unchanging word
 it is time o lord for you to let your work be seen for they have made your law without effect
 for this reason i have greater love far your teachings than for gold even for shining gold
 because of it i keep straight in all things by your orders and i am a hater of every false way
 &ltpe&gt your unchanging word is full of wonder for this reason my soul keeps it
 the opening of your words gives light it gives good sense to the simple
 my mouth was open wide waiting with great desire for your teachings
 let your eyes be turned to me and have mercy on me as it is right for you to do to those who are lovers of your name
 let my steps be guided by your word and let not sin have control over me
 make me free from the cruel rule of man then i will keep your orders
 let your servant see the shining of your face give me knowledge of your rules
 rivers of water are flowing from my eyes because men do not keep your law
 &lttzade&gt o lord great is your righteousness and upright are your decisions
 you have given your unchanging word in righteousness and it is for ever
 my passion has overcome me because my haters are turned away from your words
 your word is of tested value and it is dear to your servant
 i am small and of no account but i keep your orders in mind
 your righteousness is an unchanging righteousness and your law is certain
 pain and trouble have overcome me but your teachings are my delight
 the righteousness of your unchanging word is eternal give me wisdom so that i may have life
 &ltkoph&gt i have made my prayer with all my heart give answer to me o lord i will keep your rules
 my cry has gone up to you take me out of trouble and i will be guided by your unchanging word
 before the sun is up my cry for help comes to your ear my hope is in your words
 in the night watches i am awake so that i may give thought to your saying
 let my voice come to you in your mercy o lord by your decisions give me life
