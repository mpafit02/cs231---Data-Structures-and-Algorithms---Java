 but if i by the spirit of god send out evil spirits then is the kingdom of god come on you
 or how may one go into a strong mans house and take his goods if he does not first put cords round the strong man and then he may take his goods
 whoever is not with me is against me and he who does not take part with me in getting people together is driving them away
 so i say to you every sin and every evil word against god will have forgiveness but for evil words against the spirit there will be no forgiveness
 and whoever says a word against the son of man will have forgiveness but whoever says a word against the holy spirit will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come
 make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree
 you offspring of snakes how are you being evil able to say good things because out of the hearts store come the words of the mouth
 the good man out of his good store gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things
 and i say to you that in the day when they are judged men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said
 for by your words will your righteousness be seen and by your words you will be judged
 then some of the scribes and pharisees hearing this said to him master we are looking for a sign from you
 but he answering said to them an evil and false generation is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonah
 for as jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish so will the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
 the men of nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of jonah and now a greater than jonah is here
 the queen of the south will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of solomon and now a greater than solomon is here
 but the unclean spirit when he is gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and getting it not
 then he says i will go back into my house from which i came out and when he comes he sees that there is no one in it but that it has been made fair and clean
 then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself and they go in and make it their living place and the last condition of that man is worse than the first even so will it be with this evil generation
 while he was still talking to the people his mother and his brothers came desiring to have talk with him
 and one said to him see your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to have talk with you
 but he in answer said to him who gave the news who is my mother and who are my brothers
 and he put out his hand to his disciples and said see my mother and my brothers 
 for whoever does the pleasure of my father in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother
 on that day jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside
 and great numbers of people came together to him so that he got into a boat and the people took up their position by the sea
 and he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying a man went out to put seed in the earth
 and while he did so some seeds were dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took them for food
 and some of the seed went among the stones where it had not much earth and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep
 and when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
 and some seeds went among thorns and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth
