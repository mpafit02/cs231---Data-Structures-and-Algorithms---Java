 and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he gave a cry
 saying what have we to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to put an end to us i see well who you are the holy one of god
 and jesus said to him sharply be quiet and come out of him
 and the unclean spirit shaking him violently and crying with a loud voice came out of him
 and they were all greatly surprised so that they put questions to one another saying what is this a new teaching  with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they do what he says
 and news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of galilee round about
 and when they came out of the synagogue they went into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
 now simons wifes mother was ill with a burning heat and they gave him word of her
 and he came and took her by the hand lifting her up and she became well and took care of their needs
 and in the evening at sundown they took to him all who were diseased and those who had evil spirits
 and all the town had come together at the door
 and a number who were ill with different diseases he made well and sent out evil spirits but he did not let the evil spirits say anything because they had knowledge of him
 and in the morning a long time before daylight he got up and went out to a quiet place and there he gave himself up to prayer
 and simon and those who were with him came after him
 and when they came up with him they said to him everyone is looking for you
 and he said to them let us go to other parts into the nearest towns so that i may give teaching there because for this purpose i came
 and he went into their synagogues in every part of galilee preaching and driving out evil spirits
 and a leper came to him and going down on his knees before him made a request saying if it is your pleasure you have the power to make me clean
 and being moved with pity he put out his hand and touching him said to him it is my pleasure be made clean
 and straight away the disease went from him and he was made clean
 and he sent him away saying to him very sharply
 see that you say nothing to any man but go and let the priest see you and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by moses for a witness to them
 but he went out and made it public giving an account of it everywhere so that jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town but was outside in the waste land and they came to him from every part
 and he got up and went into the country of judaea on the other side of jordan and great numbers of people came together to him again and as was his way he gave them teaching
 and pharisees came to him testing him with the question is it right for a man to put away his wife
 and he said to them in answer what did moses say you were to do
 and they said to him moses let us give her a statement in writing and be free from her
 but jesus said to them because of your hard hearts he gave you this law
 but from the first male and female made he them
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife
