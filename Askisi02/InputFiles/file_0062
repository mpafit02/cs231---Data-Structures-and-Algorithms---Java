 and i saw him saying to me go out of jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me
 and i said lord they themselves have knowledge that i went through the synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you
 and when stephen your witness was put to death i was there giving approval and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death
 and he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles
 and they gave him a hearing as far as this word then with loud voices they said away with this man from the earth it is not right for him to be living
 and while they were crying out and pulling off their clothing and sending dust into the air
 the chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building saying that he would put him to the test by whipping so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him
 and when they had put leather bands round him paul said to the captain who was present is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a roman and has not been judged
 and hearing this the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it saying what are you about to do for this man is a roman
 and the chief captain came to him and said give me an answer are you a roman and he said yes
 and the chief captain said i got roman rights for myself at a great price and paul said but i had them by birth
 then those who were about to put him to the test went away and the chief captain was in fear seeing that he was a roman and that he had put chains on him
 but on the day after desiring to have certain knowledge of what the jews had to say against him he made him free and gave orders for the chief priests and all the sanhedrin to come together and he took paul and put him before them
 and paul looking fixedly at the sanhedrin said my brothers my life has been upright before god till this day
 and the high priest ananias gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth
 then paul said to him god will give blows to you you whitewashed wall are you here to be my judge by law and by your orders am i given blows against the law
 and those who were near said do you say such words against gods high priest
 and paul said brother i had no idea that he was the high priest for it has been said you may not say evil about the ruler of your people
 but when paul saw that half of them were sadducees and the rest pharisees he said in the sanhedrin brothers i am a pharisee and the son of pharisees i am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead
 and when he had said this there was an argument between the pharisees and the sadducees and a division in the meeting
 for the sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead and no angels or spirits but the pharisees have belief in all these
 and there was a great outcry and some of the scribes on the side of the pharisees got up and took part in the discussion saying we see no evil in this man what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit
 and when the argument became very violent the chief captain fearing that paul would be pulled in two by them gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them and take him into the army building
 and the night after the lord came to his side and said be of good heart for as you have been witnessing for me in jerusalem so will you be my witness in rome
 and when it was day the jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put paul to death
 and more than forty of them took this oath
 and they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said we have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put paul to death
 so now will you and the sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail and we before ever he gets to you will be waiting to put him to death
 but pauls sisters son had word of their design and he came into the army building and gave news of it to paul
 and paul sent for a captain and said take this young man to your chief for he has news for him
