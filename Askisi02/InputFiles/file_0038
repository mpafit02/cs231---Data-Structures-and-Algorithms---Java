 because god then will give us such rewards dear brothers let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit and become completely holy in the fear of god
 let your hearts be open to us we have done no man wrong no man has been damaged by us we have made no profit out of any man
 it is not with the purpose of judging you that i say this for i have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together
 my words to you are without fear i am full of pride on account of you i have great comfort and joy in all our troubles
 for even when we had come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side there were fightings outside and fears inside
 but god who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of titus
 and not by his coming only but by the comfort which he had in you while he gave us word of your desire your sorrow your care for me so that i was still more glad
 for though my letter gave you pain i have no regret for it now though i had before for i see that the letter gave you pain but only for a time
 now i am glad not that you had sorrow but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything
 for the sorrow which god gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart in which there is no reason for grief but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death
 for you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before god what clearing of yourselves what wrath against sin what fear what desire what serious purpose what punishment in everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business
 so though i sent you a letter it was not only because of the man who did the wrong or because of him to whom the wrong was done but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of god
 so we have been comforted and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of titus for his spirit had been made glad by you all
 for i was not put to shame in anything in which i may have made clear to him my pride in you but as we said nothing to you but what was true so the good things which i said to titus about you were seen by him to be true
 and his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all how you gave way to his authority and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour
 it gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way
 and now we give you news brothers about the grace of god which has been given to the churches of macedonia
 how while they were undergoing every sort of trouble and were in the greatest need they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others
 for i give them witness that as they were able and even more than they were able they gave from the impulse of their hearts
 seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints
 and going even farther than our hope they first gave themselves to the lord and to us after the purpose of god
 so that we made a request to titus that as he had made a start before so he might make this grace complete in you
 and that as you are full of every good thing of faith of the word of knowledge of a ready mind and of love to us so you may be full of this grace in the same way
 i am not giving you an order but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love
 for you see the grace of our lord jesus christ how though he had wealth he became poor on your account so that through his need you might have wealth
 and in this i give my opinion for it is to your profit who were the first to make a start a year before not only to do this but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it
 then make the doing of it complete so that as you had a ready mind you may give effect to it as you are able
 for if there is a ready mind a man will have gods approval in the measure of what he has and not of what he has not
 and i am not saying this so that others may get off free while the weight comes on you
 but so that things may be equal that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way making things equal
