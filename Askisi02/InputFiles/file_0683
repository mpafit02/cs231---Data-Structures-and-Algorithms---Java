 to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his rule
 and it came again in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah up to the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah till jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month
 now the word of the lord came to me saying
 before you were formed in the body of your mother i had knowledge of you and before your birth i made you holy i have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations
 then said i o lord god  see i have no power of words for i am a child
 but the lord said to me do not say i am a child for wherever i send you you are to go and whatever i give you orders to say you are to say
 have no fear because of them for i am with you to keep you safe says the lord
 then the lord put out his hand touching my mouth and the lord said to me see i have put my words in your mouth
 see this day i have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms for uprooting and smashing down for destruction and overturning for building up and planting
 again the word of the lord came to me saying jeremiah what do you see and i said i see a branch of an almond tree
 then the lord said to me you have seen well for i keep watch over my word to give effect to it
 and the word of the lord came to me a second time saying what do you see and i said i see a boiling pot and its face is from the north
 then the lord said to me out of the north evil will come bursting out on all the people of the land
 for see i will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north says the lord and they will come everyone placing his high seat at the way into jerusalem and against its walls on every side and against all the towns of judah
 and i will give my decision against them on account of all their evil doing because they have given me up burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands
 so make yourself ready and go and say to them everything i give you orders to say do not be overcome by fear of them or i will send fear on you before them
 for see this day have i made you a walled town and an iron pillar and walls of brass against all the land against the kings of judah against its captains against its priests and against the people of the land
 they will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for i am with you says the lord to give you salvation
 give ear to the word which the lord says to you o people of israel
 this is what the lord has said do not go in the way of the nations have no fear of the signs of heaven for the nations go in fear of them
 for that which is feared by the people is foolish it is the work of the hands of the workman for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe
 they make it beautiful with silver and gold they make it strong with nails and hammers so that it may not be moved
 it is like a pillar in a garden of plants and has no voice it has to be lifted for it has no power of walking have no fear of it for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good
 there is no one like you o lord you are great and your name is great in power
 who would not have fear of you o king of the nations for it is your right for among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you
 but they are together like beasts and foolish the teaching of false gods is wood
 silver hammered into plates is sent from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold worker blue and purple is their clothing all the work of expert men
 but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an eternal king when he is angry the earth is shaking with fear and the nations give way before his wrath
 this is what you are to say to them the gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens
 he has made the earth by his power he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out
