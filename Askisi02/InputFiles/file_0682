 let my teaching be kept secret and my words be given to my disciples only

 and when they say to you make request for us to those who have control of spirits and to those wise in secret arts who make hollow bird like sounds is it not right for a people to make request to their gods to make request for the living to the dead
 then say to them put your faith in the teaching and the witness  if they do not say such things  for him there is no dawn 
 and he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food and when he is unable to get food he will become angry cursing his king and his god and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high
 and he will be looking down on the earth and there will be trouble and dark clouds black night where there is no seeing
 in earlier times he made the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali of small value but after that he gave it glory by the way of the sea on the other side of jordan galilee of the nations

 you have made them very glad increasing their joy they are glad before you as men are glad in the time of getting in the grain or when they make division of the goods taken in war
 for by your hand the yoke on his neck and the rod on his back even the rod of his cruel master have been broken as in the day of midian
 for every boot of the man of war with his sounding step and the clothing rolled in blood will be for burning food for the fire

 of the increase of his rule and of peace there will be no end on the seat of david and in his kingdom to make it strong supporting it with wise decision and righteousness now and for ever by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done

 aram on the east and the philistines on the west who have come against israel with open mouths for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 but the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them and they made no prayer to the lord of armies
 for this cause the lord took away from israel head and tail high and low in one day

 for this cause the lord will have no pleasure in their young men and no pity on their widows and the children without fathers for they are all haters of god and evil doers and foolish words come from every mouth for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 for evil was burning like a fire the blackberries and thorns were burned up the thick woods took fire rolling up in dark clouds of smoke
 the land was dark with the wrath of the lord of armies the people were like those who take mens flesh for food
 on the right a man was cutting off bits and was still in need on the left a man took a meal but had not enough no man had pity on his brother every man was making a meal of the flesh of his neighbour
 manasseh was making a meal of ephraim and ephraim of manasseh and together they were attacking judah for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
