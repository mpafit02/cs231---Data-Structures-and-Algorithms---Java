 and last of all the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the lord jesus is this that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to god as in fact you are doing now so you will go on in these ways but more and more
 because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the lord jesus
 for the purpose of god for you is this that you may be holy and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh
 so that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour
 not in the passion of evil desires like the gentiles who have no knowledge of god
 and that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business for the lord is the judge in all these things as we said to you before and gave witness
 because it is gods purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy
 whoever then goes against this word goes against not man but god who gives his holy spirit to you
 but about loving the brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter for you have the teaching of god that love for one another is right and necessary
 and truly you are lovers of all the brothers in macedonia but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more
 and that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business working with your hands as we gave you orders
 that you may be respected by those who are outside and may have need of nothing
 but it is our desire brothers that you may be certain about those who are sleeping so that you may have no need for sorrow as others have who are without hope
 for if we have faith that jesus underwent death and came back again even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by gods power
 for this we say to you by the word of the lord that we who are still living at the coming of the lord will not go before those who are sleeping
 because the lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority with the voice of the chief angel with the sound of a horn and the dead in christ will come to life first
 then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the lord in the air and so will we be for ever with the lord
 so then give comfort to one another with these words
 but about the times and their order my brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you
 for you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night
 when they say there is peace and no danger then sudden destruction will come on them as birth pains on a woman with child and they will not be able to get away from it
 but you my brothers are not in the dark for that day to overtake you like a thief
 for you are all sons of light and of the day we are not of the night or of the dark
 so then let us not take our rest as the others do but let us be self controlled and awake
 for those who are sleeping do so in the night and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night
 but let us who are of the day be serious putting on the breastplate of faith and love and on our heads the hope of salvation
 for gods purpose for us is not wrath but salvation through our lord jesus christ
 who was put to death for us so that awake or sleeping we may have a part in his life
 so then go on comforting and building up one another as you have been doing
 but we make this request to you my brothers give attention to those who are working among you who are over you in the lord to keep order among you
