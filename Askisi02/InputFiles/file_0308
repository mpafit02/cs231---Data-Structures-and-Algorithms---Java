 and with the stones he made an altar to the name of the lord and he made a deep drain all round the altar great enough to take two measures of seed
 and he put the wood in order and cutting up the ox put it on the wood then he said get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood and he said do it a second time and they did it a second time
 and he said do it a third time and they did it a third time
 and the water went all round the altar till the drain was full
 then at the time of the offering elijah the prophet came near and said o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel let it be seen this day that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and that i have done all these things by your order
 give me an answer o lord give me an answer so that this people may see that you are god and that you have made their hearts come back again
 then the fire of the lord came down burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and drinking up the water in the drain
 and when the people saw it they all went down on their faces and said the lord he is god the lord he is god
 and elijah said to them take the prophets of baal let not one of them get away so they took them and elijah made them go down to the stream kishon and put them to death there
 then elijah said to ahab up  take food and drink for there is a sound of much rain
 so ahab went up to have food and drink while elijah went up to the top of carmel and he went down on the earth putting his face between his knees
 and he said to his servant go now and take a look in the direction of the sea and he went up and after looking said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and he went seven times
 and the seventh time he said i see a cloud coming up out of the sea as small as a mans hand then he said go up and say to ahab get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back
 and after a very little time the heaven became black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab went in his carriage to jezreel
 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he made himself strong and went running before ahab till they came to jezreel
 ahab gave jezebel news of all elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets to death with the sword
 then jezebel sent a servant to elijah saying may the gods punishment be on me if i do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time
 and he got up fearing for his life and went in flight and came to beer sheba in judah parting there from his servant
 while he himself went a days journey into the waste land and took a seat under a broom plant desiring for himself only death for he said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am no better than my fathers
 and stretching himself on the earth he went to sleep under the broom plant but an angel touching him said to him get up and have some food
 and looking up he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water so he took food and drink and went to sleep again
 and the angel of the lord came again a second time and touching him said get up and have some food or the journey will be overmuch for your strength
 so he got up and took food and drink and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights to horeb the mountain of god
 and there he went into a hole in the rock for the night then the word of the lord came to him saying what are you doing here elijah
 and he said i have been burning for the honour of the lord the god of armies for the children of israel have not kept your agreement they have made destruction of your altars and have put your prophets to death with the sword till i even i am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
 then he said go out and take your place on the mountain before the lord then the lord went by and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind and rocks were broken before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind there was an earth shock but the lord was not in the earth shock
 and after the earth shock a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire the sound of a soft breath
 and elijah hearing it went out covering his face with his robe and took his place in the opening of the hole and there a voice came to him saying what are you doing here elijah
 and he said i have been burning for the honour of the lord the god of armies for the children of israel have not kept your agreement they have had your altars broken down and have put your prophets to death with the sword till i even i am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
 and the lord said to him go back on your way through the waste land to damascus and when you come there put the holy oil on hazael to make him king over aram
