 everything which is high goes in fear of him he is king over all the sons of pride
 and job said in answer to the lord
 i see that you are able to do every thing and to give effect to all your designs
 who is this who makes dark the purpose of god by words without knowledge for i have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out
 give ear to me and i will say what is in my mind i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 word of you had come to my ears but now my eye has seen you
 for this cause i give witness that what i said is false and in sorrow i take my seat in the dust
 and it came about after he had said these words to job that the lord said to eliphaz the temanite i am very angry with you and your two friends because you have not said what is right about me as my servant job has
 and now take seven oxen and seven sheep and go to my servant job and give a burned offering for yourselves and my servant job will make prayer for you that i may not send punishment on you because you have not said what is right about me as my servant job has
 and eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did as the lord had said and the lord gave ear to job
 and the lord made up to job for all his losses after he had made prayer for his friends and all job had before was increased by the lord twice as much
 and all his brothers and sisters and his friends of earlier days came and took food with him in his house and made clear their grief for him and gave him comfort for all the evil which the lord had sent on him and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring
 and the lords blessing was greater on the end of jobs life than on its start and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and two thousand oxen and a thousand she asses
 and he had seven sons and three daughters
 and he gave the first the name of jemimah the second keziah and the third keren happuch
 and there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of job in all the earth and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers
 and after this job had a hundred and forty years of life and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations
 and job came to his end old and full of days
 give now a cry for help is there anyone who will give you an answer and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer
 for wrath is the cause of death to the foolish and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion
 i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly the curse came on his house
 now his children have no safe place and they are crushed before the judges for no one takes up their cause
 their produce is taken by him who has no food and their grain goes to the poor and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring
 for evil does not come out of the dust or trouble out of the earth
 but trouble is mans fate from birth as the flames go up from the fire
 but as for me i would make my prayer to god and i would put my cause before him
 who does great things outside our knowledge wonders without number
 who gives rain on the earth and sends water on the fields
 lifting up those who are low and putting the sad in a safe place
 who makes the designs of the wise go wrong so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes
