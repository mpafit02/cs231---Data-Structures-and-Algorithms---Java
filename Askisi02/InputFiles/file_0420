 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital
 and the sixth ithream whose mother was davids wife eglah these were the sons of david whose birth took place in hebron
 now while there was war between sauls people and davids people abner was making himself strong among the supporters of saul
 now saul had among his wives a woman named rizpah the daughter of aiah and ish bosheth said to abner why have you taken my fathers wife
 and abner was very angry at the words of ish bosheth and he said am i a dogs head of judah i am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father saul and for his brothers and his friends and have not given you up into the hands of david and now you say i have done wrong with a woman
 may gods punishment be on abner if i do not for david as the lord in his oath has said
 and if i do not take away the kingdom from the family of saul and make david ruler over israel and judah from dan as far as beer sheba 
 and so great was ish bosheths fear of abner that he was not able to say a word in answer
 and abner sent men to david at hebron saying make an agreement with me and i will give you my support in getting all israel on your side
 and he said it is well i will make an agreement with you but on one condition which is that when you come before me sauls daughter michal is to come with you till she comes you will not see my face
 and david sent men to sauls son ish bosheth saying give me back michal my wife whom i made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred philistines
 so ish bosheth sent and took her from her husband paltiel the son of laish
 and her husband went with her as far as bahurim weeping while he went then abner said to him go back and he went back
 then abner had a talk with the chief men of israel saying in the past it was your desire to make david your king so now do it
 for the lord has said of david by the hand of my servant david i will make my people israel safe from the philistines and from all who are against them
 and abner said the same things to benjamin and he went to david in hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to israel and to all the people of benjamin
 so abner with twenty men came to hebron to david and david made a feast for abner and the men who were with him
 and abner said to david now i will go and make all israel come to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you and your kingdom may be as wide as your hearts desire then david sent abner away and he went in peace
 now the servants of david and joab had been out attacking a band of armed men and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight but abner was no longer in hebron with david for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace
 when joab and his men came news was given them that abner the son of ner had come to the king who had let him go away again in peace
 then joab came to the king and said what have you done when abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go
 is it not clear to you that abner the son of ner came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing
 and when joab had come out from david he sent men after abner and they overtook him at the water spring of sirah and made him come back with them but david had no knowledge of it
 and when abner was back in hebron joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly and there he gave him a wound in the stomach causing his death in payment for the death of his brother asahel
 and when david had word of it he said may i and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the lord from the blood of abner the son of ner
 may it come on the head of joab and all his fathers family among the men of joabs family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers or who do the work of women or are put to the sword or are wasted from need of food 
 so joab and abishai his brother put abner to death because he had put to death their brother asahel in the fight at gibeon
 and david said to joab and all the people who were with him go in grief and put haircloth about you in sorrow for abner and king david went after the dead body
 and they put abners body to rest in hebron and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting place of abners body
 and the king made a song of grief for abner and said was the death of abner to be like the death of a foolish man
