 as it says in the writings he who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough
 but praise be to god who puts the same care for you into the heart of titus
 for while he gladly gave ear to our request he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart
 and with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches
 and not only so but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the lord and to make clear that our mind was ready
 and so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands
 for the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval not only of the lord but of men
 and we have sent with them our brother whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you
 if any question comes up about titus he is my brother worker working with me for you or about the others they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of christ
 make clear then to them as representatives of the churches the quality of your love and that the things which we have said about you are true
 but there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints
 for i have before made clear to those of macedonia my pride in your ready mind saying to them that achaia has been ready for a year back and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example
 but i have sent the brothers so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true and that as i said you may be ready
 for fear that if any from macedonia come with me and you are not ready we  not to say you  might be put to shame in this thing
 so it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready so that it might be a cause for praise and not as if we were making profit out of you
 but in the writings it says he who puts in only a small number of seeds will get in the same and he who puts them in from a full hand will have produce in full measure from them
 let every man do after the purpose of his heart not giving with grief or by force for god takes pleasure in a ready giver
 and god is able to give you all grace in full measure so that ever having enough of all things you may be full of every good work
 as it is said in the writings he has sent out far and wide he has given to the poor his righteousness is for ever
 and he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food will take care of the growth of your seed at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness
 your wealth being increased in everything with a simple mind causing praise to god through us
 for this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints but is the cause of much praise to god
 for when through this work of giving they see what you are they give glory to god for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of christ and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all
 while their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you because of the great grace of god which is in you
 praise be to god for what he has given which words have no power to say
 paul and silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
 grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ
 it is right for us to give praise to god at all times for you brothers because of the great increase of your faith and the wealth of your love for one another
 so that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of god for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through
 which is a clear sign of the decision which god in his righteousness has made to give you a part in his kingdom for which you have undergone this pain
