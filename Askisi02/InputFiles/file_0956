 your faith is unchanging from generation to generation you have put the earth in its place and it is not moved
 they are ruled this day by your decisions for all things are your servants
 if your law had not been my delight my troubles would have put an end to me
 i will ever keep your orders in mind for in them i have life
 i am yours o be my saviour for my desire has been for your rules
 the sinners have been waiting for me to give me up to destruction but i will give all my mind to your unchanging ward
 i have seen that nothing on earth is complete but your teaching is very wide
 &ltmem&gt o what love i have for your law  i give thought to it all the day
 your teaching has made me wiser than my haters for it is mine for ever
 i have more knowledge than all my teachers because i give thought to your unchanging word
 i have more wisdom than the old because i have kept your orders
 i have kept back my feet from all evil ways so that i might be true to your word
 my heart has not been turned away from your decisions for you have been my teacher
 how sweet are your sayings to my taste  truly they are sweeter than honey in my mouth 
 through your orders i get wisdom for this reason i am a hater of every false way
 &ltnun&gt your word is a light for my feet ever shining on my way
 i have made an oath and kept it to be guided by your upright decisions
 i am greatly troubled o lord give me life in keeping with your word
 take o lord the free offerings of my mouth and give me knowledge of your decisions
 my soul is ever in danger but i still keep the memory of your law
 sinners have put a net to take me but i was true to your orders
 i have taken your unchanging word as an eternal heritage for it is the joy of my heart
 my heart is ever ready to keep your rules even to the end
 &ltsamech&gt i am a hater of men of doubting mind but i am a lover of your law
 you are my secret place and my breastplate against danger my hope is in your word
 go far from me you evil doers so that i may keep the teachings of my god
 be my support as you have said and give me life let not my hope be turned to shame
 let me not be moved and i will be safe and ever take delight in your rules
 you have overcome all those who are wandering from your rules for all their thoughts are false
 all the sinners of the earth are like waste metal in your eyes and for this cause i give my love to your unchanging word
