 but if the disease in his skin becomes worse after he has been made clean
 then the priest is to see him and if the mark is increased the priest without looking for the yellow hair will say that he is unclean
 but if in his opinion the growth is stopped and black hair has come up on it the disease has gone he is clean and the priest will say that he is clean
 and if a man or a woman has bright marks on the skin of their flesh that is bright white marks
 then the priest is to see them and if the white marks on their skin are not very bright it is a skin disease which has come out on the skin he is clean
 and if a mans hair has come out and he has no hair still he is clean
 and if the hair has gone from the front part of his head so that he has no hair there still he is clean
 but if on his head or on his brow where he has no hair there is a red and white place it is the disease of the leper coming out on his head or on his brow
 then if the priest sees that the growth of the disease has become red and white on his head or on his brow where there is no hair like the mark in the skin of a leper
 he is a leper and unclean the priest is to say that he is most certainly unclean the disease is in his head
 and the leper who has the disease on him is to go about with signs of grief with his hair loose and his mouth covered crying unclean unclean
 while the disease is on him he will be unclean he is unclean let him keep by himself living outside the tent circle
 and any clothing of wool or of linen in which is the mark of the disease
 if it is in the threads of the linen or of the wool or in leather or in anything made of skin
 if there are red or green marks on the clothing or on the leather or in the threads of the cloth or in anything made of skin it is the lepers disease let the priest see it
 and after it has been seen by the priest the thing which is so marked is to be shut up for seven days
 and he is to see the mark on the seventh day if the mark is increased in the clothing or in the threads of the material or in the leather whatever the leather is used for it is the disease biting into it it is unclean
 and the clothing or the wool or linen material or anything of leather in which is the disease is to be burned for the disease is biting into it let it be burned in the fire
 and if the priest sees that the mark is not increased in the clothing or in any part of the material or in the leather
 then the priest will give orders for the thing on which the mark is to be washed and to be shut up for seven days more
 and if after the mark has been washed the priest sees that the colour of it is not changed and it is not increased it is to be burned in the fire the disease is working in it though the damage may be inside or outside
 and if the priest sees that the mark is less bright after the washing then let him have it cut out of the clothing or the leather or from the threads of the material
 and if the mark is still seen in the clothing or in the threads of the material or in the leather it is the disease coming out the thing in which the disease is will have to be burned with fire
 and the material of the clothing or anything of skin which has been washed if the mark has gone out of it let it be washed a second time and it will be clean
 this is the law about the lepers disease in the thread of wool or linen material in clothing or in anything of skin saying how it is to be judged clean or unclean
 and the lord said to moses
 this is the law of the leper on the day when he is made clean he is to be taken to the priest
 and the priest is to go outside the tent circle and if after looking the priest sees that the mark of the disease has gone from him
 then the priest is to give orders to take for him who is to be made clean two living clean birds and some cedar wood and red thread and hyssop
 and the priest will give orders for one of the birds to be put to death in a vessel made of earth over flowing water
