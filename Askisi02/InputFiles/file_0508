 and it will be their part as a right for ever from the children of israel it is a special offering from the children of israel made from their peace offerings a special offering lifted up to the lord
 and aarons holy robes will be used by his sons after him they will put them on when they are made priests
 for seven days the son who becomes priest in his place will put them on when he comes into the tent of meeting to do the work of the holy place
 then take the sheep of the wave offering and let its flesh be cooked in water in a holy place
 and let aaron and his sons make a meal of it with the bread in the basket at the door of the tent of meeting
 all those things which were used as offerings to take away sin and to make them holy to be priests they may have for food but no one who is not a priest may have them for they are holy food
 and if any of the flesh of the offering or of the bread is over till the morning let it be burned with fire it is not to be used for food for it is holy
 all these things you are to do to aaron and his sons as i have given you orders for seven days the work of making them priests is to go on
 every day an ox is to be offered as a sin offering to take away sins and by this offering on it you will make the altar clean from sin and you are to put oil on it and make it holy
 for seven days you are to make offerings for the altar and make it holy so that it may become completely holy and anything touching it will become holy
 now this is the offering which you are to make on the altar two lambs in their first year every day regularly
 one lamb is to be offered in the morning and the other in the evening
 and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of the best meal mixed with a fourth part of a hin of clear oil and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering
 and the other lamb is to be offered in the evening and with it the same meal offering and drink offering for a sweet smell an offering made by fire to the lord
 this is to be a regular burned offering made from generation to generation at the door of the tent of meeting before the lord where i will come face to face with you and have talk with you
 there i will come face to face with the children of israel and the tent will be made holy by my glory
 i will make holy the tent of meeting and the altar and aaron and his sons i will make holy to be my priests
 among the children of israel i will make my living place and i will be their god
 and they will see that i am the lord their god who took them out of the land of egypt so that i might be ever with them i am the lord their god
 now moses was looking after the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he took the flock to the back of the waste land and came to horeb the mountain of god
 and the angel of the lord was seen by him in a flame of fire coming out of a thorn tree and he saw that the tree was on fire but it was not burned up
 and moses said i will go and see this strange thing why the tree is not burned up
 and when the lord saw him turning to one side to see god said his name out of the tree crying moses moses and he said here am i
 and he said do not come near take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
 and he said i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses kept his face covered for fear of looking on god
 and god said truly i have seen the grief of my people in egypt and their cry because of their cruel masters has come to my ears for i have knowledge of their sorrows
 and i have come down to take them out of the hands of the egyptians guiding them out of that land into a good land and wide into a land flowing with milk and honey into the place of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 for now truly the cry of the children of israel has come to me and i have seen the cruel behaviour of the egyptians to them
 come then and i will send you to pharaoh so that you may take my people the children of israel out of egypt
 and moses said to god who am i to go to pharaoh and take the children of israel out of egypt
