 and any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people my agreement has been broken by him
 and god said as for sarai your wife from now her name will be not sarai but sarah
 and i will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her truly my blessing will be on her and she will be the mother of nations kings of peoples will be her offspring
 then abraham went down on his face and laughing said in his heart may a man a hundred years old have a child will sarah at ninety years old give birth
 and abraham said to god if only ishmaels life might be your care 
 and god said not so but sarah your wife will have a son and you will give him the name isaac and i will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him
 as for ishmael i have given ear to your prayer truly i have given him my blessing and i will make him fertile and give him great increase he will be the father of twelve chiefs and i will make him a great nation
 but my agreement will be with isaac to whom sarah will give birth a year from this time
 and having said these words god went up from abraham
 and abraham took ishmael his son and all whose birth had taken place in his house and all his servants whom he had made his for a price every male of his house and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as god had said to him
 abraham was ninety nine years old when he underwent circumcision
 and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision
 abraham and ishmael his son underwent circumcision on that very day
 and all the men of his house those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands underwent circumcision with him
 now the lord came to him by the holy tree of mamre when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day
 and lifting up his eyes he saw three men before him and seeing them he went quickly to them from the door of the tent and went down on his face to the earth
 and said my lord if now i have grace in your eyes do not go away from your servant
 let me get water for washing your feet and take your rest under the tree
 and let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength and after that you may go on your way for this is why you have come to your servant and they said let it be so
 then abraham went quickly into the tent and said to sarah get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes
 and running to the herd he took a young ox soft and fat and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready
 and he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them waiting by them under the tree while they took food
 and they said to him where is sarah your wife and he said she is in the tent
 and he said i will certainly come back to you in the spring and sarah your wife will have a son and his words came to the ears of sarah who was at the back of the tent door
 now abraham and sarah were very old and sarah was past the time for giving birth
 and sarah laughing to herself said now that i am used up am i still to have pleasure my husband himself being old
 and the lord said why was sarah laughing and saying is it possible for me being old to give birth to a child
 is there any wonder which the lord is not able to do at the time i said in the spring i will come back to you and sarah will have a child
 then sarah said i was not laughing for she was full of fear and he said no but you were laughing
 and the men went on from there in the direction of sodom and abraham went with them on their way
