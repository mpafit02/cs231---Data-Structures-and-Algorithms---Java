 after him amasiah the son of zichri who freely gave himself to the lord and with him two hundred thousand men of war
 and the captains of benjamin eliada a great man of war and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and body covers
 and after him jehozabad and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war
 these were the men who were waiting on the king in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all judah
 now jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour and his son was married to ahabs daughter
 and after some years he went down to samaria to see ahab and ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen and he got jehoshaphat to go with him to ramoth gilead
 for ahab king of israel said to jehoshaphat king of judah will you go with me to ramoth gilead and he said i am as you are and my people as your people we will be with you in the war
 then jehoshaphat said to the king of israel let us now get directions from the lord
 so the king of israel got together all the prophets four hundred men and said to them am i to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and they said go up for god will give it into the hands of the king
 but jehoshaphat said is there no other prophet of the lord here from whom we may get directions
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is still one man by whom we may get directions from the lord but i have no love for him because he has never been a prophet of good to me but only of evil he is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
 then the king of israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said go quickly and come back with micaiah the son of imla
 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made himself iron horns and said the lord says pushing back the aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
 and all the prophets said the same thing saying go up to ramoth gilead and it will go well for you for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 now the servant who had gone to get micaiah said to him see now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
 and micaiah said by the living lord whatever the lord says to me i will say
 when he came to the king the king said to him micaiah are we to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and he said go up and it will go well for you and they will be given up into your hands
 and the king said to him have i not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the lord
 then he said i saw all israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the lord said these have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me but of evil
 then he said give ear now to the word of the lord i saw the lord seated on his seat of power and all the army of heaven in their places at his right hand and at his left
 and the lord said how may ahab king of israel be tricked into going up to ramoth gilead to his death and one said one thing and one another
 then a spirit came forward and took his place before the lord and said i will get him to do it by a trick and the lord said to him how
 and he said i will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
 and now see the lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours and the lord has said evil against you
 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and gave micaiah a blow on the side of his face saying where is the spirit of the lord whose word is in you
 and micaiah said truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
 and the king of israel said take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the town and to joash the kings son
 and say by the kings order this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till i come back in peace
