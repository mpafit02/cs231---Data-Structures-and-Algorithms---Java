 so the lord gave to israel all the land which he gave by oath to their fathers so it became their heritage and their living place
 and the lord gave them peace on every side as he had said to their fathers all those who were against them gave way before them for the lord gave them all up into their hands
 the lord kept faith with the house of israel about all the good which he said he would do for them and all his words came true
 then joshua sent for the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
 and said to them you have kept all the orders of moses the lords servant and have done everything i gave you orders to do
 you have now been with your brothers for a long time till this day you have been doing the orders of the lord your god
 and now the lord your god has given your brothers rest as he said so now you may go back to your tents to the land of your heritage which moses the lords servant gave to you on the other side of jordan
 only take great care to do the orders and the law which moses the lords servant gave you to have love for the lord your god and to go in all his ways and to keep his laws and to be true to him and to be his servants with all your heart and with all your soul
 then joshua gave them his blessing and sent them away and they went back to their tents
 now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given a heritage in bashan but to the other half joshua gave a heritage among their brothers on the west side of jordan now when joshua sent them away to their tents he gave them his blessing
 and said to them go back with much wealth to your tents and with very much cattle with silver and gold and brass and iron and with a very great store of clothing give your brothers a part of the goods taken in the war
 so reuben and gad and the half tribe of manasseh went back parting from the children of israel at shiloh in the land of canaan to go to the land of gilead to the land of their heritage which had been given to them by the lords order to moses
 now when they came to the country by jordan in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh put up there by jordan a great altar seen from far
 and news came to the children of israel see the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have put up an altar opposite the land of canaan in the country by jordan on the side which is israels
 then all the meeting of the children of israel hearing this came together at shiloh to go up against them to war
