 these rules are to be your guide in judging through all your generations wherever you may be living
 anyone causing the death of another is himself to be put to death on the word of witnesses but the word of one witness is not enough
 further no price may be given for the life of one who has taken life and whose right reward is death he is certainly to be put to death
 and no price may be offered for one who has gone in flight to a safe town for the purpose of letting him come back to his place before the death of the high priest
 so do not make the land where you are living unholy for blood makes the land unholy and there is no way of making the land free from the blood which has come on it but only by the death of him who was the cause of it
 do not make unclean the land where you are living and in which is my house for i the lord am present among the children of israel
 now the heads of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came to moses the chiefs and the heads of families of the children of israel being present
 and said the lord gave orders to my lord to make distribution of the land as their heritage to the children of israel and my lord was ordered by the lord to give the heritage of zelophehad our brother to his daughters
 now if they get married to any of the sons of other tribes of the children of israel then their property will be taken away from the heritage of our fathers and become part of the heritage of the tribe into which they get married and their heritage will be taken away from the heritage of our tribe
 and at the time of the jubilee of the children of israel their property will be joined to the heritage of the tribe of which they are part and will be taken away from the heritage of the tribe of our fathers
 so by the direction of the lord moses gave orders to the children of israel saying what the tribe of the sons of joseph have said is right
 this is the order of the lord about the daughters of zelophehad the lord says let them take as their husbands whoever is most pleasing to them but only among the family of their fathers tribe
 and so no property will be handed from tribe to tribe among the children of israel but every one of the children of israel will keep the heritage of his fathers tribe
 and every daughter owning property in any tribe of the children of israel is to be married to one of the family of her fathers tribe so that every man of the children of israel may keep the heritage of his fathers
 and no property will be handed from one tribe to another but every tribe of the children of israel will keep its heritage
 so the daughters of zelophehad did as the lord gave orders to moses
 for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad took as their husbands the sons of their fathers brothers
 and were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their property was kept in the tribe of their fathers family
 these are the laws and the orders which the lord gave to the children of israel by moses in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 let the sons of kohath from among the sons of levi be numbered by their families in the order of their fathers houses
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who are able to do the work of the tent of meeting
 and this is to be the work of the sons of kohath in connection with the most holy things
 when all the people go forward aaron is to go in with his sons and take down the veil of the curtain covering the ark of witness with it
 and putting over it the leather cover and over that a blue cloth and putting its rods in place
 and on the table of the holy bread they are to put a blue cloth and on it all the vessels the spoons and the basins and the cups and the holy bread with them
 and over them they are to put a red cloth covering it with a leather cover and putting its rods in their places
 and they are to take a blue cloth covering with it the light support with its lights and its instruments and its trays and all the oil vessels which are used for it
 all these they are to put in a leather cover and put it on the frame
 on the gold altar they are to put a blue cloth covering it with a leather cover and they are to put its rods in their places
