 and he was greatly surprised because they had no faith and he went about the country places teaching
 and he gave orders to the twelve and sent them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
 and he said that they were to take nothing for their journey but a stick only no bread no bag no money in their pockets
 they were to go with common shoes on their feet and not to take two coats
 and he said to them wherever you go into a house make that your resting place till you go away
 and whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you when you go away put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them
 and they went out preaching the need for a change of heart in men
 and they sent out a number of evil spirits and put oil on a great number who were ill and made them well
 and king herod had news of him because his name was on the lips of all and he said john the baptist has come back from the dead and for this reason these powers are working in him
 but others said it is elijah and others said it is a prophet even like one of the prophets
 but herod when he had news of it said john whom i put to death has come back from the dead
 for herod himself had sent men out to take john and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife whom he had taken for himself
 for john said to herod it is wrong for you to have your brothers wife
 and herodias was bitter against him desiring to put him to death but she was not able
 for herod was in fear of john being conscious that he was an upright and holy man and kept him safe and hearing him he was much troubled and he gave ear to him gladly
 and the chance came when herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords and the high captains and the chief men of galilee
 and when the daughter of herodias herself came in and did a dance herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her and the king said to the girl make a request for anything and i will give it you
 and he took an oath saying to her whatever is your desire i will give it to you even half of my kingdom
 and she went out and said to her mother what is my request to be and she said the head of john the baptist
 and she came in quickly to the king and said my desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of john the baptist
 and the king was very sad but because of his oaths and those who were with him at table he would not say no to her
 and straight away the king sent out one of his armed men and gave him an order to come back with the head and he went and took off johns head in prison
 and came back with the head on a plate and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
 and when his disciples had news of it they came and took up his body and put it in its last resting place
 and the twelve came together to jesus and they gave him an account of all the things they had done and all they had been teaching
 and he said to them come away by yourselves to a quiet place and take a rest for a time because there were a great number coming and going and they had no time even for food
 and they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves
 and the people saw them going and a number of them having knowledge who they were went running there together on foot from all the towns and got there before them
 and he got out and saw a great mass of people and he had pity on them because they were like sheep without a keeper and he gave them teaching about a number of things
 and at the end of the day his disciples came to him and said this place is waste land and it is late
