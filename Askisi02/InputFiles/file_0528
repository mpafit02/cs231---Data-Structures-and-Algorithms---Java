 when these went on the others went and when these came to rest the others came to rest and when these were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
 and over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch looking like ice stretched out over their heads on high
 under the arch their wings were straight one stretched out to another every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side
 and when they went the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears like the voice of the ruler of all a sound like the rushing of an army when they came to rest they let down their wings
 and there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads when they came to rest they let down their wings
 and on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a kings seat like a sapphire stone and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high
 and i saw it coloured like electrum with the look of fire in it and round it going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body i saw what was like fire and there was a bright light shining round him
 like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain so was the light shining round him and this is what the glory of the lord was like and when i saw it i went down on my face and the voice of one talking came to my ears
 then looking i saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone having the form of a kings seat
 and he said to the man clothed in linen go in between the wheels under the winged ones and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town and he went in before my eyes
 now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in and the inner square was full of the cloud
 and the glory of the lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the lords glory
 and the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square like the voice of the ruler of all
 and when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the winged ones then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel
 and stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones he took some of it and went out
 and i saw the form of a mans hands among the winged ones under their wings
 and looking i saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye
 in form the four of them were all the same they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel
 when they were moving they went on their four sides without turning they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking they went without turning
 and the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about
 as for the wheels they were named in my hearing the circling wheels
 and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a winged one and the second was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
 and the winged ones went up on high this is the living being which i saw by the river chebar
 and when the winged ones went the wheels went by their side and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth the wheels were not turned from their side
 when they were at rest in their place these were at rest when they were lifted up these went up with them for the spirit of life was in them
 then the glory of the lord went out from the doorstep of the house and came to rest over the winged ones
 and the winged ones lifting up their wings went up from the earth before my eyes with the wheels by their side and they came to rest at the east doorway of the lords house and the glory of the god of israel was over them on high
 this is the living being which i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones
 every one had four faces and every one had four wings and hands like a mans hands were under their wings
 as for the form of their faces they were the faces whose form i saw by the river chebar when they went every one of them went straight forward
