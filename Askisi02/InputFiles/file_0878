 then the tribe of naphtali with ahira the son of enan as their chief
 the number of his army was fifty three thousand four hundred
 the number of all the armies in the tents of dan was a hundred and fifty seven thousand six hundred they will go forward last by their flags
 these are all who were numbered of the children of israel in the order of their fathers families all the armies in their tents together came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty
 but the levites were not numbered among the children of israel as the lord said to moses
 so the children of israel did as the lord said to moses so they put up their tents by their flags and they went forward in the same order by their families and by their fathers houses
 in the first month all the children of israel came into the waste land of zin and put up their tents in kadesh there death came to miriam and they put her body to rest in the earth
 and there was no water for the people and they came together against moses and against aaron
 and the people were angry with moses and said if only death had overtaken us when our brothers came to their death before the lord 
 why have you taken the lords people into this waste for death to come to us and to our cattle there
 why have you made us come out of egypt into this evil place this is no place of seed or figs or vines or other fruits and there is no water for drinking
 then moses and aaron went away from the people to the door of the tent of meeting and falling on their faces there they saw the glory of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 take the rod you and aaron your brother and make all the people come together and before their eyes give orders to the rock to give out its water and so make water come out of the rock for them and give the people and their cattle drink
 and moses took the rod from before the lord as he gave him orders
 then moses and aaron made the people come together in front of the rock and he said to them give ear now you people whose hearts are turned from the lord are we to get water for you out of the rock
 and lifting up his hand moses gave the rock two blows with his rod and water came streaming out and the people and their cattle had drink enough
 then the lord said to moses and aaron because you had not enough faith in me to keep my name holy before the children of israel you will not take this people into the land which i have given them
 these are the waters of meribah because the children of israel went against the lord and they saw that he was holy among them
