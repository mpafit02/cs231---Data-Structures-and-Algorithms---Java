 i will do wisely in the way of righteousness o when will you come to me i will be walking in my house with a true heart
 i will not put any evil thing before my eyes i am against all turning to one side i will not have it near me
 the false heart i will send away from me i will not have an evil doer for a friend
 i will put to death anyone who says evil of his neighbour secretly the man with a high look and a heart of pride is disgusting to me
 my eyes will be on those of good faith in the land so that they may be living in my house he who is walking in the right way will be my servant
 the worker of deceit will not come into my house the false man will have no place before my eyes
 morning by morning will i put to death all the sinners in the land so that all evil doers may be cut off from jerusalem
 &lta prayer of the man who is in trouble when he is overcome and puts his grief before the lord&gt give ear to my prayer o lord and let my cry come to you
 let not your face be veiled from me in the day of my trouble give ear to me and let my cry be answered quickly
 my days are wasted like smoke and my bones are burned up as in a fire
 my heart is broken it has become dry and dead like grass so that i give no thought to food
 because of the voice of my sorrow my flesh is wasted to the bone
 i am like a bird living by itself in the waste places like the night bird in a waste of sand
 i keep watch like a bird by itself on the house top
 my haters say evil of me all day those who are violent against me make use of my name as a curse
 i have had dust for bread and my drink has been mixed with weeping
 because of your passion and your wrath for i have been lifted up and then made low by you
 my days are like a shade which is stretched out i am dry like the grass
 but you o lord are eternal and your name will never come to an end
 you will again get up and have mercy on zion for the time has come for her to be comforted
 for your servants take pleasure in her stones looking with love on her dust
 so the nations will give honour to the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth will be in fear of his glory
 when the lord has put up the walls of zion and has been been in his glory
 when he has given ear to the prayer of the poor and has not put his request on one side
 this will be put in writing for the coming generation and the people of the future will give praise to the lord
 for from his holy place the lord has seen looking down on the earth from heaven
 hearing the cry of the prisoner making free those for whom death is ordered
 so that they may give out the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem
 when the peoples are come together and the kingdoms to give worship to the lord
 he has taken my strength from me in the way he has made short my days
