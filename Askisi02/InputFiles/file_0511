 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that they are to keep my sabbaths for the sabbath day is a sign between me and you through all your generations so that you may see that i am the lord who makes you holy
 so you are to keep the sabbath as a holy day and anyone not honouring it will certainly be put to death whoever does any work on that day will be cut off from his people
 six days may work be done but the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest holy to the lord whoever does any work on the sabbath day is to be put to death
 and the children of israel are to keep the sabbath holy from generation to generation by an eternal agreement
 it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever because in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he took his rest and had pleasure in it
 and when his talk with moses on mount sinai was ended he gave him the two stones of the law two stones on which was the writing made by the finger of god
 and when the people saw that moses was a long time coming down from the mountain they all came to aaron and said to him come make us a god to go before us as for this moses who took us up out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has become of him
 then aaron said to them take off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and give them to me
 and all the people took the gold rings from their ears and gave them to aaron
 and he took the gold from them and hammering it with an instrument he made it into the metal image of a young ox and they said this is your god o israel who took you out of the land of egypt
 and when aaron saw this he made an altar before it and made a public statement saying tomorrow there will be a feast to the lord
 so early on the day after they got up and made burned offerings and peace offerings and took their seats at the feast and then gave themselves to pleasure
 and the lord said to moses go down quickly for your people whom you took out of the land of egypt are turned to evil ways
 even now they are turned away from the rule i gave them and have made themselves a metal ox and given worship to it and offerings saying this is your god o israel who took you up out of the land of egypt
 and the lord said to moses i have been watching this people and i see that they are a stiff necked people
 now do not get in my way for my wrath is burning against them i will send destruction on them but of you i will make a great nation
 but moses made prayer to god saying lord why is your wrath burning against your people whom you took out of the land of egypt with great power and with the strength of your hand
 why let the egyptians say he took them out to an evil fate to put them to death on the mountains cutting them off from the earth let your wrath be turned away from them and send not this evil on your people
 have in mind abraham isaac and israel your servants to whom you gave your oath saying i will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and all this land will i give to your seed as i said to be their heritage for ever
 so the lord let himself be turned from his purpose of sending punishment on his people
 then moses came down the mountain with the two stones of the law in his hand the stones had writing on their two sides on the front and on the back
 the stones were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god cut on the stones
 now when the noise and the voices of the people came to the ears of joshua he said to moses there is a noise of war in the tents
 and moses said it is not the voice of men who are overcoming in the fight or the cry of those who have been overcome it is the sound of songs which comes to my ear
 and when he came near the tents he saw the image of the ox and the people dancing and in his wrath moses let the stones go from his hands and they were broken at the foot of the mountain
 and he took the ox which they had made burning it in the fire and crushing it to powder and he put it in the water and made the children of israel take a drink of it
 and moses said to aaron what did the people do to you that you let this great sin come on them
 and aaron said let not my lord be angry you have seen how the purposes of this people are evil
 for they said to me make us a god to go before us as for this moses who took us up out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has come to him
