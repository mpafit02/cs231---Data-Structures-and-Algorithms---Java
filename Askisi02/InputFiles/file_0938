 before the mountains were put in their places before the hills was my birth
 when he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world
 when he made ready the heavens i was there when he put an arch over the face of the deep
 when he made strong the skies overhead when the fountains of the deep were fixed
 when he put a limit to the sea so that the waters might not go against his word when he put in position the bases of the earth
 then i was by his side as a master workman and i was his delight from day to day playing before him at all times
 playing in his earth and my delight was with the sons of men
 give ear to me then my sons for happy are those who keep my ways
 take my teaching and be wise do not let it go
 happy is the man who gives ear to me watching at my doors day by day keeping his place by the pillars of my house
 for whoever gets me gets life and grace from the lord will come to him
 but he who does evil to me does wrong to his soul all my haters are in love with death
 wisdom has made her house putting up her seven pillars
 she has put her fat beasts to death her wine is mixed her table is ready
 she has sent out her women servants her voice goes out to the highest places of the town saying
 whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who has no sense she says
 come take of my bread and of my wine which is mixed
 give up the simple ones and have life and go in the way of knowledge
 he who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name
 do not say sharp words to a man of pride or he will have hate for you make them clear to a wise man and you will be dear to him
 give teaching to a wise man and he will become wiser give training to an upright man and his learning will be increased
 the fear of the lord is the start of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one gives a wise mind
 for by me your days will be increased and the years of your life will be long
 if you are wise you are wise for yourself if your heart is full of pride you only will have the pain of it
 the foolish woman is full of noise she has no sense at all
 seated at the door of her house in the high places of the town
 crying out to those who go by going straight on their way she says
 whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who is without sense she says
 drink taken without right is sweet and food in secret is pleasing
 but he does not see that the dead are there that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld
