 and they came before eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and before the chiefs saying the lord gave orders to moses to give us a heritage among our brothers so in agreement with the orders of the lord he gave them a heritage among their fathers brothers
 and ten parts were given to manasseh in addition to the land of gilead and bashan which is on the other side of jordan
