 then haggai said so is this people and so is this nation before me says the lord and so is every work of their hands and the offering they give there is unclean
 and now give thought looking back from this day to the time before one stone was put on another in the temple of the lord
 how when anyone came to a store of twenty measures there were only ten when anyone went to the wine store to get fifty vessels full there were only twenty
 and i sent burning and wasting and a rain of ice drops on all the works of your hands but still you were not turned to me says the lord
 and now give thought looking on from this day from the twenty fourth day of the ninth month from the time when the base of the lords house was put in its place give thought to it
 is the seed still in the store house have the vine and the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree still not given their fruit from this day i will send my blessing on you
 and the word of the lord came a second time to haggai on the twenty fourth day of the month saying
 say to zerubbabel ruler of judah i will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth
 overturning the power of kingdoms and i will send destruction on the strength of the kingdoms of the nations by me war carriages will be overturned with those who are in them and the horses and the horsemen will come down everyone by the sword of his brother
 in that day says the lord of armies i will take you o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel says the lord and will make you as a jewelled ring for i have taken you to be mine says the lord of armies
 the word of the lord which came to hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel
 the start of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go take for yourself a wife of loose ways and children of the same for the land has been untrue to the lord
 so he took as his wife gomer the daughter of diblaim and she gave birth to a son
 and the lord said to him give him the name of jezreel for after a little time i will send punishment for the blood of jezreel on the line of jehu and put an end to the kingdom of israel
 and in that day i will let the bow of israel be broken in the valley of jezreel
 and after that she gave birth to a daughter and the lord said give her the name lo ruhamah for i will not again have mercy on israel to give them forgiveness
 but i will have mercy on judah and will give them salvation by the lord their god but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen
 now when lo ruhamah had been taken from the breast the woman gave birth to a son
 and the lord said give him the name lo ammi for you are not my people and i will not be your god
 but still the number of the children of israel will be like the sand of the sea which may not be measured or numbered and in place of its being said to them you are not my people it will be said to them you are the sons of the living god
 and the children of israel and the children of judah will come together and take for themselves one head and will go up from the land for great will be the day of jezreel
 israel is a branching vine full of fruit as his fruit is increased so the number of his altars is increased as the land is fair so they have made fair pillars
 their mind is taken away now they will be made waste he will have their altars broken down he will give their pillars to destruction
 now truly they will say we have no king we have no fear of the lord and the king what is he able to do for us
 their words are foolish they make agreements with false oaths so punishment will come up like a poison plant in a ploughed field
 the people of samaria will be full of fear because of the ox of beth aven its people will have sorrow for it and its priests will give cries of grief for its glory for the glory has gone in flight
 and they will take it to assyria and give it to the great king shame will come on ephraim and israel will be shamed because of its image
 as for samaria her king is cut off like mist on the water
 and the high places of aven the sin of israel will come to destruction thorns and waste plants will come up on their altars they will say to the mountains be a cover over us and to the hills come down on us
 o israel you have done evil from the days of gibeah there they took up their position so that the fighting against the children of evil might not overtake them in gibeah
