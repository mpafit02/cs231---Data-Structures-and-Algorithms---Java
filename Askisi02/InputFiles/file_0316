 ahishar was controller of the kings house adoniram the son of abda was overseer of the forced work
 and solomon put twelve overseers over all israel to be responsible for the stores needed for the king and those of his house every man was responsible for one month in the year
 and these are their names  the son of hur in the hill country of ephraim
  the son of deker in makaz and shaalbim and beth shemesh and elonbeth hanan
  the son of hesed in arubboth socoh and all the land of hepher were under his control
  the son of abinadab in all naphath dor his wife was taphath the daughter of solomon

 shimei the son of ela in benjamin
 geber the son of uri in the land of gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and one overseer had authority over all the overseers who were in the land
 judah and israel were as great in number as the sand by the seaside and they took their food and drink with joy in their hearts
 and solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the philistines and as far as the edge of egypt men gave him offerings and were his servants all the days of his life
 and the amount of solomons food for one day was thirty measures of crushed grain and sixty measures of meal
 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen from the fields and a hundred sheep in addition to harts and gazelles and roes and fat fowls
 for he had authority over all the country on this side of the river from tiphsah to gaza over all the kings on this side of the river and he had peace round him on every side
 so judah and israel were living safely every man under his vine and his fig tree from dan as far as beer sheba all the days of solomon
 and solomon had four thousand boxed off spaces for horses for his carriages and twelve thousand horsemen
 and those overseers every man in his month saw that food was produced for solomon and all his guests they took care that nothing was overlooked
 and they took grain and dry grass for the horses and the carriage horses to the right place every man as he was ordered
 and god gave solomon a great store of wisdom and good sense and a mind of wide range as wide as the sand by the seaside
 and solomons wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of egypt
 for he was wiser than all men even than ethan the ezrahite and heman and calcol and darda the sons of mahol and he had a great name among all the nations round about
 he was the maker of three thousand wise sayings and of songs to the number of a thousand and five
 he made sayings about all plants from the cedar in lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth
 people came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of solomon from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom
 now hiram king of tyre hearing that solomon had been made king in place of his father sent his servants to him for hiram had ever been a friend to david
