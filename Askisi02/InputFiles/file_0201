 and some falling on good earth gave fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
 he who has ears let him give ear
 and the disciples came and said to him why do you say things to them in the form of stories
 and he said to them in answer to you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
 because whoever has to him will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 for this reason i put things into the form of stories because they see without seeing and give ear without hearing and the sense is not clear to them
 and for them the words of isaiah have come true though you give ear you will not get knowledge and seeing you will see but the sense will not be clear to you
 for the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me so that i might make them well
 but a blessing be on your eyes because they see and on your ears because they are open
 for truly i say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see and saw them not and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears and they had it not
 give ear then to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth
 when the word of the kingdom comes to anyone and the sense of it is not clear to him then the evil one comes and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart he is the seed dropped by the wayside
 and that which went on the stones this is he who hearing the word straight away takes it with joy
 but having no root in himself he goes on for a time and when trouble comes or pain because of the word he quickly becomes full of doubts
 and that which was dropped among the thorns this is he who has the word and the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
 and the seed which was put in good earth this is he who gives ear to the word and gets the sense of it who gives fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
 and he gave them another story saying the kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field
 but while men were sleeping one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain and went away
 but when the green stem came up and gave fruit the evil plants were seen at the same time
 and the servants of the master of the house came and said to him sir did you not put good seed in your field how then has it evil plants
 and he said someone has done this in hate and the servants say to him is it your pleasure that we go and take them up
 but he says no for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants you may be rooting up the grain with them
 let them come up together till the getting in of the grain and then i will say to the workers take up first the evil plants and put them together for burning but put the grain into my store house
 he put another story before them saying the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field
 which is smaller than all seeds but when it has come up it is greater than the plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting places in its branches
 another story he gave to them the kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and put in three measures of meal till it was all leavened
 all these things jesus said to the people in the form of stories and without a story he said nothing to them
 that it might come true which was said by the prophet opening my mouth i will give out stories i will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time
 then he went away from the people and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field
 and he made answer and said he who puts the good seed in the earth is the son of man
