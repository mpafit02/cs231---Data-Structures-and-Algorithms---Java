 and it came between the army of egypt and the army of israel and there was a dark cloud between them and they went on through the night but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night
 and when moses hand was stretched out over the sea the lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land
 and the children of israel went through the sea on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
 then the egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea all pharaohs horses and his war carriages and his horsemen
 and in the morning watch the lord looking out on the armies of the egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud sent trouble on the army of the egyptians
 and made the wheels of their war carriages stiff so that they had hard work driving them so the egyptians said let us go in flight from before the face of israel for the lord is fighting for them against the egyptians
 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out over the sea and the waters will come back again on the egyptians and on their war carriages and on their horsemen
 and when moses hand was stretched out over the sea at dawn the sea came flowing back meeting the egyptians in their flight and the lord sent destruction on the egyptians in the middle of the sea
 and the waters came back covering the war carriages and the horsemen and all the army of pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea not one of them was to be seen
 but the children of israel went through the sea walking on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
 so that day the lord gave israel salvation from the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead on the seas edge
 and israel saw the great work which the lord had done against the egyptians and the fear of the lord came on the people and they had faith in the lord and in his servant moses
 then moses and the children of israel made this song to the lord and said i will make a song to the lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent down into the sea
 the lord is my strength and my strong helper he has become my salvation he is my god and i will give him praise my fathers god and i will give him glory
 the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
 pharaohs war carriages and his army he has sent down into the sea the best of his captains have gone down into the red sea
 they were covered by the deep waters like a stone they went down under the waves
 full of glory o lord is the power of your right hand by your right hand those who came against you are broken
 when you are lifted up in power all those who come against you are crushed when you send out your wrath they are burned up like dry grass
 by your breath the waves were massed together the flowing waters were lifted up like a pillar the deep waters became solid in the heart of the sea
 egypt said i will go after them i will overtake i will make division of their goods my desire will have its way with them my sword will be uncovered my hand will send destruction on them
 you sent your wind and the sea came over them they went down like lead into the great waters
 who is like you o lord among the gods who is like you in holy glory to be praised with fear doing wonders
 when your right hand was stretched out the mouth of the earth was open for them
 in your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours guiding them in your strength to your holy place
 hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear the people of philistia were gripped with pain
 the chiefs of edom were troubled in heart the strong men of moab were in the grip of fear all the people of canaan became like water
 fear and grief came on them by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone till your people went over o lord till the people went over whom you have made yours
 you will take them in planting them in the mountain of your heritage the place o lord where you have made your house the holy place o lord the building of your hands
 the lord is king for ever and ever
