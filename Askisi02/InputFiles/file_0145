 for salt is good but if the taste goes from it of what use is it
 it is no good for the land or for the place of waste no one has a use for it he who has ears let him give ear
 now all the tax farmers and sinners came near to give ear to him
 and the pharisees and scribes were angry saying this man gives approval to sinners and takes food with them
 and he made a story for them saying
 what man of you having a hundred sheep if one of them gets loose and goes away will not let the ninety nine be in the waste land by themselves and go after the wandering one till he sees where it is
 and when he has got it again he takes it in his arms with joy
 and when he gets back to his house he sends for his neighbours and friends saying to them be glad with me for i have got back my sheep which had gone away
 i say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing than for ninety nine good men who have no need of a change of heart
 or what woman having ten bits of silver if one bit has gone from her hands will not get a light and go through her house searching with care till she sees it
 and when she has it again she gets her friends and neighbours together saying be glad with me for i have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me
 even so i say to you there is joy among the angels of god when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing
 and he said a certain man had two sons
 and the younger of them said to his father father give me that part of your property which will be mine and he made division of his goods between them
 and not long after the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far away country and there all his money went in foolish living
 and when everything was gone there was no food to be had in that country and he was in need
 and he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food
 and so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs food and no one gave him anything
 but when he came to his senses he said what numbers of my fathers servants have bread enough and more while i am near to death here through need of food 
 i will get up and go to my father and will say to him father i have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes
 i am no longer good enough to be named your son make me like one of your servants
 and he got up and went to his father but while he was still far away his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss
 and his son said to him father i have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes i am no longer good enough to be named your son
 but the father said to his servants get out the first robe quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
 and get the fat young ox and put it to death and let us have a feast and be glad
 for this my son who was dead is living again he had gone away from me and has come back and they were full of joy
 now the older son was in the field and when he came near the house the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears
 and he sent for one of the servants questioning him about what it might be
 and he said to him your brother has come and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely
 but he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and made a request to him to come in
