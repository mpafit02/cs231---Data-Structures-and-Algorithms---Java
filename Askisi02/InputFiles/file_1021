 you gave them an answer o lord our god you took away their sin though you gave them punishment for their wrongdoing
 give high honour to the lord our god worshipping with your faces turned to his holy hill for the lord our god is holy
 now there came a time in the days of the judges when there was no food in the land and a certain man went from beth lehem judah he and his wife and his two sons to make a living place in the country of moab
 and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of beth lehem judah and they came into the country of moab and were there for some time
 and elimelech naomis husband came to his end and only her two sons were with her
 and they took two women of moab as their wives the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they went on living there for about ten years
 and mahlon and chilion came to their end and the woman was without her two sons and her husband
 so she and her daughters in law got ready to go back from the country of moab for news had come to her in the country of moab that the lord in mercy for his people had given them food
 and she went out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on their way to go back to the land of judah
 and naomi said to her two daughters in law go back to your mothers houses may the lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me
 may the lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands then she gave them a kiss and they were weeping bitterly
 and they said to her no but we will go back with you to your people
 but naomi said go back my daughters why will you come with me have i more sons in my body to become your husbands
 go back my daughters and go on your way i am so old now that i may not have another husband if i said i have hopes if i had a husband tonight and might have sons
 would you keep yourselves till they were old enough would you keep from having husbands for them no my daughters but i am very sad for you that the hand of the lord is against me
 then again they were weeping and orpah gave her mother in law a kiss but ruth would not be parted from her
 and naomi said see your sister in law has gone back to her people and to her gods go back after your sister in law
 but ruth said give up requesting me to go away from you or to go back without you for where you go i will go and where you take your rest i will take my rest your people will be my people and your god my god
 wherever death comes to you death will come to me and there will be my last resting place the lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death
 and when she saw that ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more
 so the two of them went on till they came to beth lehem and when they came to beth lehem all the town was moved about them and they said is this naomi
 and she said to them do not let my name be naomi but mara for the ruler of all has given me a bitter fate
 i went out full and the lord has sent me back again with nothing why do you give me the name naomi seeing that the lord has given witness against me and the ruler of all has sent sorrow on me
 so naomi came back out of the country of moab and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her and they came to beth lehem in the first days of the grain cutting
 and naomi had a relation of her husband a man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz
 and ruth the moabitess said to naomi now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes i may have grace and she said to her go my daughter
 and she went and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of boaz who was of the family of elimelech
 and boaz came from beth lehem and said to the grain cutters the lord be with you and they made answer the lord give you his blessing
 then boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters whose girl is this
 and the servant who was in authority over the cutters said it is a moabite girl who came back with naomi out of the country of moab
