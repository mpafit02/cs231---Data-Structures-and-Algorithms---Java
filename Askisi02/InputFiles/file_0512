 then i said to them whoever has any gold let him take it off so they gave it to me and i put it in the fire and this image of an ox came out
 and moses saw that the people were out of control for aaron had let them loose to their shame before their haters
 then moses took his place at the way into the tents and said whoever is on the lords side let him come to me and all the sons of levi came together to him
 and he said to them this is the word of the lord the god of israel let every man take his sword at his side and go from one end of the tents to the other putting to death his brother and his friend and his neighbour
 and the sons of levi did as moses said and about three thousand of the people were put to death that day
 and moses said you have made yourselves priests to the lord this day for every one of you has made the offering of his son and his brother the blessing of the lord is on you this day
 and on the day after moses said to the people great has been your sin but i will go up to the lord and see if i may get forgiveness for your sin
 then moses went back to the lord and said this people has done a great sin making themselves a god of gold
 but now if you will give them forgiveness  but if not let my name be taken out of your book
 and the lord said to moses whoever has done evil against me will be taken out of my book
 but now go take the people into that place of which i have given you word see my angel will go before you but when the time of my judging has come i will send punishment on them for their sin
 and the lord sent punishment on the people because they gave worship to the ox which aaron made
 and the lord said to moses go forward from this place you and the people whom you have taken up out of the land of egypt to that land about which i made an oath to abraham isaac and jacob saying to your seed will i give it
 and i will send an angel before you driving out the canaanite and the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 go up to that land flowing with milk and honey but i will not go up among you for you are a stiff necked people for fear that i send destruction on you while you are on the way
 hearing this bad news the people were full of grief and no one put on his ornaments
 and the lord said to moses say to the children of israel you are a stiff necked people if i come among you even for a minute i will send destruction on you so take off all your ornaments so that i may see what to do with you
 so the children of israel took off their ornaments at mount horeb and did not put them on again
 now it was moses way to put up the tent of meeting outside the tent circle at some distance away giving it the name of the tent of meeting and everyone desiring to make his prayer to the lord went to the tent of meeting outside the tent circle
 and whenever moses went out to the tent of meeting all the people got up and everyone went to the door of his tent looking after moses till he went inside the tent
 and whenever moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud came down and took its place by the door of the tent as long as the lord was talking with moses
 and all the people saw the cloud at the door of the tent and they went down on their faces everyone at the door of his tent
 and the lord had talk with moses face to face as a man may have talk with his friend and when moses came back to the tents his servant the young man joshua the son of nun did not come away from the tent
 and moses said to the lord see you say to me be this peoples guide on their journey but you have not made clear to me whom you will send with me but you have said i have knowledge of you by name and you have grace in my eyes
 if then i have grace in your eyes let me see your ways so that i may have knowledge of you and be certain of your grace and my prayer is that you will keep in mind that this nation is your people
 and he said i myself will go with you and give you rest
 and moses said if you yourself are not going with us do not send us on from here
 for is not the fact of your going with us the sign that i and this people have grace in your eyes so that we that is i and your people are separate from all other people on the face of the earth
 and the lord said to moses i will do as you say for you have grace in my eyes and i have knowledge of you by your name
 and moses said o lord let me see your glory
