 you have seen my shame how i was laughed at and made low my haters are all before you
 my heart is broken by bitter words i am full of grief i made a search for some to have pity on me but there was no one i had no comforter
 they gave me poison for my food and bitter wine for my drink
 let their table before them be for their destruction let their feasts become a net to take them
 let their eyes be blind so that they may not see let their bodies for ever be shaking
 let your curse come on them let the heat of your wrath overtake them
 give their houses to destruction and let there be no one in their tents
 because they are cruel to him against whom your hand is turned they make bitter the grief of him who is wounded by you
 let their punishment be increased let them not come into your righteousness
 let their names be taken from the book of the living let them not be numbered with the upright
 but i am poor and full of sorrow let me be lifted up by your salvation o lord
 i will give praise to the name of god with a song i will give glory to him for what he has done
 this will be more pleasing to the lord than an ox or a young ox of full growth
 the poor will see it and be glad you who are lovers of god let your hearts have life
 for the ears of the lord are open to the poor and he takes thought for his prisoners
 let the heavens and the earth give praise to him the seas and everything moving in them
 for god will be the saviour of zion and the builder of the towns of judah so that it may be their resting place and heritage
 the seed of his servants will have their part in it and there the lovers of his name will have rest
 &ltshiggaion of david a song which he made to the lord about the words of cush the benjamite&gt o lord my god i put my faith in you take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me and make me free
 so that he may not come rushing on my soul like a lion wounding it while there is no one to be my saviour
 o lord my god if i have done this if my hands have done any wrong
 if i have given back evil to him who did evil to me or have taken anything from him who was against me without cause
 let my hater go after my soul and take it let my life be crushed to the earth and my honour into the dust  selah 
 come up lord in your wrath be lifted up against my haters be awake my god give orders for the judging
 the meeting of the nations will be round you take your seat then over them on high
 the lord will be judge of the peoples give a decision for me o lord because of my righteousness and let my virtue have its reward
 o let the evil of the evil doer come to an end but give strength to the upright for mens minds and hearts are tested by the god of righteousness
 god who is the saviour of the upright in heart is my breastplate
 god is the judge of the upright and is angry with the evil doers every day
 if a man is not turned from his evil he will make his sword sharp his bow is bent and ready
