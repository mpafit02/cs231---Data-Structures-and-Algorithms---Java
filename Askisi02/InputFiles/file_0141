 and i say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men the son of man will give witness before the angels of god
 but if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me i will say that i have no knowledge of him before the angels of god
 and if anyone says a word against the son of man he will have forgiveness but for him who says evil words against the holy spirit there will be no forgiveness
 and when they take you before the synagogues and the authorities and the rulers take no thought about what answers you will give or what you will say
 for the holy spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say
 and one of the people said to him master give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me
 but he said man who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you
 and he said to them take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property for a mans life is not made up of the number of things which he has
 and he said to them in a story the land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile
 and he said to himself what is to be done for i have no place in which to put all my fruit
 and he said this i will do i will take down my store houses and make greater ones and there i will put all my grain and my goods
 and i will say to my soul soul you have a great amount of goods in store enough for a number of years be at rest take food and wine and be happy
 but god said to him you foolish one tonight i will take your soul from you and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together
 so that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself and has not wealth in the eyes of god
 and he said to his disciples for this reason i say to you take no thought for your life about what food you will take or for your body how it may be clothed
 is not life more than food and the body than its clothing
 give thought to the ravens they do not put seeds into the earth or get together grain they have no store houses or buildings and god gives them their food of how much greater value are you than the birds 
 and which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller
 if then you are not able to do even that which is least why are you troubled about the rest
 give thought to the flowers they do no work they make no thread and still i say to you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
 but if god gives such clothing to the grass in the field which today is living and tomorrow will be burned in the oven how much more will he give clothing to you o men of little faith
 and do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink and let not your mind be full of doubts
 for the nations of the world go in search of all these things but your father has knowledge that you have need of them
 but let your chief care be for his kingdom and these other things will be given to you in addition
 have no fear little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
 give what property you have in exchange for money and give the money to the poor make for yourselves money bags which will not get old wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction
 for where your wealth is there will your heart be
 be ready dressed as for a journey with your lights burning
 and be like men who are looking for their lord when he comes back from the bride feast so that when he comes to the door it will be open to him quickly
 happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes truly i say to you he will make himself their servant and placing them at the table he will come out and give them food
