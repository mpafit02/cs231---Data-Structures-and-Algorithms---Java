 but he said before them all that it was false saying i have no knowledge of what you say
 and when he had gone out into the doorway another saw him and says to those who were there this man was with jesus the nazarene
 and again he said with an oath i have no knowledge of the man
 and after a little time those who were near came and said to peter truly you are one of them because your talk is witness against you
 then with curses and oaths he said i have no knowledge of the man and straight away there came the cry of a cock
 and the word of jesus came back to peter when he said before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me and he went out weeping bitterly
 now when it was morning all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting jesus to death
 and they put cords on him and took him away and gave him up to pilate the ruler
 then judas who was false to him seeing that he was to be put to death in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority
 saying i have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man but they said what is that to us it is your business
 and he put down the silver in the temple and went out and put himself to death by hanging
 and the chief priests took the silver and said it is not right to put it in the temple store for it is the price of blood
 and they made a decision to get with the silver the potters field as a place for the dead of other countries
 for this cause that field was named the field of blood to this day
 then came true that which was said by jeremiah the prophet and they took the thirty bits of silver the price of him who was valued by the children of israel
 and they gave them for the potters field as i had word from the lord
 and jesus was before the ruler who put a question to him are you the king of the jews and jesus said to him you say so
 but when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him he gave no answer
 then says pilate to him do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you
 and he gave him no answer not even a word so that the ruler was greatly surprised
 now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner at their selection
 and they had then an important prisoner whose name was barabbas
 so when they came together pilate said to them whom will you have barabbas or jesus who is named christ
 for he saw that for envy they had given him up
 and while he was on the judges seat his wife sent to him saying have nothing to do with that upright man for i have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him
 now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for barabbas and for jesus to be put to death
 but the ruler made answer and said to them which of the two is it your pleasure that i let go free and they said barabbas
 pilate says to them what then am i to do with jesus who is named christ they all say let him be put to death on the cross
 and he said why what evil has he done but they gave loud cries saying to the cross with him 
 so when pilate saw that he was able to do nothing but that trouble was working up he took water and washing his hands before the people said the blood of this upright man is not on my hands you are responsible
