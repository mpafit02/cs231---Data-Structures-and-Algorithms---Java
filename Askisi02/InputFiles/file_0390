 then isaiah the prophet made prayer to the lord and he made the shade go back ten degrees from its position on the steps of ahaz
 at that time merodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters with an offering to hezekiah because he had news that hezekiah had been ill
 and hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil of great price and the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which hezekiah did not let them see
 then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and said to him what did these men say and where did they come from and hezekiah said they came from a far country even from babylon
 and he said what have they seen in your house and hezekiah said in answer they saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which i did not let them see
 and isaiah said to hezekiah give ear to the word of the lord
 truly days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to babylon all will be gone says the lord
 and your sons the offspring of your body they will take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of babylon
 then hezekiah said to isaiah good is the word of the lord which you have said then he said  if in my time there is peace and righteousness
 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his power and how he made the pool and the stream to take water into the town are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and manasseh his son became king in his place
 manasseh was twelve years old when he became king for fifty five years he was ruling in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzi bah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the disgusting ways of those nations whom the lord had sent out before the children of israel
 he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by hezekiah his father he made altars for baal and an asherah as ahab king of israel had done he was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
 and he put up altars in the house of the lord of which the lord had said in jerusalem will i put my name
 and he put up altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the lord
 and he made his son go through the fire and made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future he gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder workers he did much evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath
 he put the image of asherah which he had made in the house of which the lord had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem the town which i have made mine out of all the tribes of israel i will put my name for ever
 and never again will i send the feet of israel wandering from the land which i gave to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders and keep all the law which my servant moses gave them
 but they did not give ear and manasseh made them do more evil than those nations did whom the lord gave up to destruction before the children of israel
 and the lord said by his servants the prophets
 because manasseh king of judah has done these disgusting things doing more evil than all the amorites before him and making judah do evil with his false gods
 for this cause says the lord the god of israel i will send such evil on jerusalem and judah that the ears of all to whom the news comes will be burning
 and over jerusalem will be stretched the line of samaria and the weight of ahab jerusalem will be washed clean as a plate is washed and turned over on its face
 and i will put away from me the rest of my heritage and give them up into the hands of their haters who will take their property and their goods for themselves
 because they have done evil in my eyes moving me to wrath from the day when their fathers came out of egypt till this day
 more than this manasseh took the lives of upright men till jerusalem from one end to the other was full of blood in addition to his sin in making judah do evil in the eyes of the lord
 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all he did and his sins are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 so manasseh went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the garden of his house in the garden of uzza and amon his son became king in his place
 amon was twenty two years old when he became king ruling in jerusalem for two years his mothers name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah
