 for we as all our fathers were are like men from a strange country before you who have got a place for a time in the land our days on the earth are like a shade and there is no hope of going on
 o lord our god all this store which we have made ready for the building of a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is yours
 and i am conscious my god that you are the searcher of hearts taking pleasure in righteousness as for me with an upright heart i have freely given all these things and i have seen with joy your people who are here to make their offerings freely to you
 o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the deepest thoughts of your people and let their hearts be fixed and true to you
 and give to solomon my son a true heart to keep your orders your rules and your laws and to do all these things and to put up this great house for which i have made ready
 and david said to all the people now give praise to the lord your god and all the people gave praise to the lord the god of their fathers with bent heads worshipping the lord and the king
 and they made offerings to the lord and gave burned offerings to the lord on the day after a thousand oxen a thousand sheep and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and a great wealth of offerings for all israel
 and with great joy they made a feast before the lord that day and they made solomon the son of david king a second time putting the holy oil on him to make him holy to the lord as ruler and on zadok as priest
 so solomon was put on the seat of the lord as king in place of his father david and everything went well for him and all israel was under his authority
 and all the chiefs and the men of war and all the sons of king david put themselves under the authority of solomon the king
 and the lord made solomon great in the eyes of all israel clothing him with glory and honour such as no other king in israel had had before him
 now david the son of jesse was king over all israel
 for forty years he was ruling as king over israel seven years in hebron and thirty three years in jerusalem
 and he came to his end after a long life full of days and great wealth and honour and solomon his son became king in his place
 now all the acts of david first and last are recorded in the words of samuel the seer and the words of nathan the prophet and the words of gad the seer
 together with all his rule and his power and the events which took place in his time in israel and in all the kingdoms of other lands
 now these were davids sons whose birth took place in hebron the oldest amnon by ahinoam of jezreel the second daniel by abigail the carmelite woman
 the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur the fourth adonijah the son of haggith

 and ibhar and elishama and eliphelet
 and nogah and nepheg and japhia
 and elishama and eliada and eliphelet nine
 all these were the sons of david in addition to the sons of his servant wives and tamar was their sister
 and solomons son was rehoboam abijah was his son asa his son jehoshaphat his son
