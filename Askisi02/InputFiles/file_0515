 and everyone whose heart was moved everyone who was guided by the impulse of his spirit came with his offering for the lord for whatever was needed for the tent of meeting and its work and for the holy robes
 they came men and women all who were ready to give and gave pins and nose rings and finger rings and neck ornaments all of gold everyone gave an offering of gold to the lord
 and everyone who had blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair and sheepskins coloured red and leather gave them
 everyone who had silver and brass gave an offering of them to the lord and everyone who had hard wood such as was needed for the work gave it
 and all the women who were expert with their hands made cloth and gave the work of their hands blue and purple and red and the best linen
 and those women who had the knowledge made the goats hair into cloth
 and the rulers gave the beryls and the cut jewels for the ephod and the priests bag
 and the spice and the oil for the light and the holy oil and the sweet perfumes
 the children of israel every man and woman from the impulse of their hearts gave their offerings freely to the lord for the work which the lord had given moses orders to have done
 and moses said to the children of israel see the lord has made selection of bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
 and he has made him full of the spirit of god in all wisdom and knowledge and art of every sort
 as an expert designer of beautiful things working in gold and silver and brass
 trained in the cutting of stones and the ornamenting of wood and in every sort of handwork
 and he has given to him and to oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan the power of training others

 so let bezalel and oholiab get to work with every wise hearted man to whom the lord has given wisdom and knowledge to do whatever is necessary for the ordering of the holy place as the lord has given orders

 and they took from moses all the offerings which the children of israel had given for the building of the holy place and still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning
 then the wise men who were doing all the work of the holy place came from their work
 and said to moses the people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the lord has given us orders to do
 so moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents saying let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place so the people were kept from giving more
