 the king made answer and said is this not great babylon which i have made for the living place of kings by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour
 while the word was still in the kings mouth a voice came down from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to you it is said the kingdom has gone from you
 and they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
 that very hour the order about nebuchadnezzar was put into effect and he was sent out from among men and had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair became long as eagles feathers and his nails like those of birds
 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifting up my eyes to heaven got back my reason and blessing the most high i gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation
 and all the people of the earth are as nothing he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth and no one is able to keep back his hand or say to him what are you doing
 at the same time my reason came back to me and for the glory of my kingdom my honour and my great name came back to me and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again and i was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before
 now i nebuchadnezzar give worship and praise and honour to the king of heaven for all his works are true and his ways are right and those who go in pride he is able to make low
 belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords drinking wine before the thousand
 belshazzar while he was overcome with wine gave orders for them to put before him the gold and silver vessels which nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in jerusalem so that the king and his lords his wives and his other women might take their drink from them
 then they took in the gold and silver vessels which had been in the temple of the house of god at jerusalem and the king and his lords his wives and his other women took wine from them
 they took their wine and gave praise to the gods of gold and silver of brass and iron and wood and stone
 in that very hour the fingers of a mans hand were seen writing opposite the support for the light on the white wall of the kings house and the king saw the part of the hand which was writing
 then the colour went from the kings face and he was troubled by his thoughts strength went from his body and his knees were shaking
 the king crying out with a loud voice said that the users of secret arts the chaldaeans and the readers of signs were to be sent for the king made answer and said to the wise men of babylon whoever is able to make out this writing and make clear to me the sense of it will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold round his neck and will be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 then all the kings wise men came in but they were not able to make out the writing or give the sense of it to the king
 then king belshazzar was greatly troubled and the colour went from his face and his lords were at a loss
 the queen because of the words of the king and his lords came into the house of the feast the queen made answer and said o king have life for ever do not be troubled by your thoughts or let the colour go from your face
 there is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of your father light and reason like the wisdom of the gods were seen in him and king nebuchadnezzar your father made him master of the wonder workers and the users of secret arts and the chaldaeans and the readers of signs
 because a most special spirit and knowledge and reason and the power of reading dreams and unfolding dark sayings and answering hard questions were seen to be in him even in daniel  named belteshazzar by the king  now let daniel be sent for and he will make clear the sense of the writing
 then they took daniel in before the king the king made answer and said to daniel so you are that daniel of the prisoners of judah whom my father took out of judah
 and i have had news of you that the spirit of the gods is in you and that light and reason and special wisdom have been seen in you
 and now the wise men the users of secret arts have been sent in before me for the purpose of reading this writing and making clear to me the sense of it but they are not able to make clear the sense of the thing
 and i have had news of you that you have the power of making things clear and of answering hard questions now if you are able to make out the writing and give me the sense of it you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain round your neck and be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 then daniel made answer and said to the king keep your offerings for yourself and give your rewards to another but i after reading the writing to the king will give him the sense of it
 as for you o king the most high god gave to nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and great power and glory and honour
 and because of the great power he gave him all peoples and nations and languages were shaking in fear before him some he put to death and others he kept living at his pleasure lifting up some and putting others down as it pleased him
 but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became hard with pride he was put down from his place as king and they took his glory from him
 and he was sent out from among the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and he was living with the asses of the fields he had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he was certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives power over it to anyone at his pleasure
 and you his son o belshazzar have not kept your heart free from pride though you had knowledge of all this
