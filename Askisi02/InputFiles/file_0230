 and he said to them why are you full of fear o you of little faith then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
 and the men were full of wonder saying what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea do his orders
 and when he had come to the other side to the country of the gadarenes there came out to him from the place of the dead two who had evil spirits so violent that no man was able to go that way
 and they gave a loud cry saying what have we to do with you you son of god have you come here to give us punishment before the time
 now there was some distance away a great herd of pigs taking their food
 and the evil spirits made strong prayers to him saying if you send us out let us go into the herd of pigs
 and he said to them go and they came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water
 and their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything and of the men who had the evil spirits
 and all the town came out to jesus and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country
 and he got into a boat and went across and came to his town
 and they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving and jesus seeing their faith said to the man who was ill son take heart you have forgiveness for your sins
 and some of the scribes said among themselves this man has no respect for god
 and jesus having knowledge of what was in their minds said why are your thoughts evil
 for which is the simpler to say you have forgiveness for your sins or to say get up and go
 but so that you may see that on earth the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins  then said he to the man who was ill  get up and take up your bed and go to your house
 and he got up and went away to his house
 but when the people saw it they were full of fear and gave glory to god who had given such authority to men
 and when jesus was going from there he saw a man whose name was matthew seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him come after me and he got up and went after him
 and it came about when he was in the house taking food that a number of tax farmers and sinners came and took their places with jesus and his disciples
 and when the pharisees saw it they said to his disciples why does your master take food with tax farmers and sinners
 but on hearing this he said those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
 but go and take to heart the sense of these words my desire is for mercy not offerings for i have come not to get the upright but sinners
 then the disciples of john came to him saying why do we and the pharisees frequently go without food but your disciples do not
 and jesus said to them will the friends of the newly married man be sad as long as he is with them but the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then will they go without food
 and no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat for by pulling away from the old it makes a worse hole
 and men do not put new wine into old wine skins or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out and the skins are of no more use but they put new wine into new wine skins and so the two will be safe
 while he was saying these things to them there came a ruler and gave him worship saying my daughter is even now dead but come and put your hand on her and she will come back to life
 and jesus got up and went after him and so did his disciples
 and a woman who for twelve years had had a flow of blood came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe
 because she said to herself if i may but put my hand on his robe i will be made well
