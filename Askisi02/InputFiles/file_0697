 and at that day the bodies of those whom the lord has put to death will be seen from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth there will be no weeping for them their bodies will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth they will be like waste on the face of the land
 give cries of grief you keepers of sheep give cries for help rolling yourselves in the dust you chiefs of the flock for the days of your destruction have fully come and i will send you in all directions and your fall will be like that of the males of the flock
 there will be no way of flight for the keepers of sheep no road for the chiefs of the flock to get away safely
 a sound of the cry of the keepers of sheep and the bitter crying of the chiefs of the flock  for the lord has made waste their green fields
 and there is no sound in the fields of peace because of the burning wrath of the lord
 the lion has come out of his secret place for the land has become a waste because of the cruel sword and because of the heat of his wrath
 when jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah first became king this word came from the lord saying
 this is what the lord has said take your place in the open square of the lords house and say to all the towns of judah who come into the lords house for worship everything i give you orders to say to them keep back not a word
 it may be that they will give ear and that every man will be turned from his evil way so that my purpose of sending evil on them because of the evil of their doings may be changed
 and you are to say to them this is what the lord has said if you do not give ear to me and go in the way of my law which i have put before you
 and give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom i send to you getting up early and sending them though you gave no attention
 then i will make this house like shiloh and will make this town a curse to all the nations of the earth
 and in the hearing of the priests and the prophets and all the people jeremiah said these words in the house of the lord
 now when jeremiah had come to the end of saying everything the lord had given him orders to say to all the people the priests and the prophets and all the people took him by force saying death will certainly be your fate
 why have you said in the name of the lord this house will be like shiloh and this land a waste with no one living in it and all the people had come together to jeremiah in the house of the lord
 and the rulers of judah hearing of these things came up from the kings house to the house of the lord and took their seats by the new door of the lords house
 then the priests and the prophets said to the rulers and to all the people the right fate for this man is death for he has said words against this town in your hearing
 then jeremiah said to all the rulers and to all the people the lord has sent me as his prophet to say against this house and against this town all the words which have come to your ears
 so now make a change for the better in your ways and your doings and give ear to the voice of the lord your god then the lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil
 as for me here i am in your hands do with me whatever seems good and right in your opinion
 only be certain that if you put me to death you will make yourselves and your town and its people responsible for the blood of one who has done no wrong for truly the lord has sent me to you to say all these words in your ears
 then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets it is not right for this man to be put to death for he has said words to us in the name of the lord our god
 then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people
 micah the morashtite who was a prophet in the days of hezekiah king of judah said to all the people of judah this is what the lord of armies has said zion will become like a ploughed field and jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like the high places of the woodland
 did hezekiah and all judah put him to death did he not in the fear of the lord make prayer for the grace of the lord and the lord let himself be turned from the decision he had made against them for evil by this act we might do great evil against ourselves
 and there was another man who was a prophet of the lord uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriath jearim he said against this town and against this land all the words which jeremiah had said
 and when his words came to the ears of jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains the king would have put him to death but uriah hearing of it was full of fear and went in flight into egypt
 and jehoiakim the king sent elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt
 and they took uriah out of egypt and came back with him to jehoiakim the king who put him to death with the sword and had his dead body put into the resting place of the bodies of the common people
 but ahikam the son of shaphan gave jeremiah his help so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death
