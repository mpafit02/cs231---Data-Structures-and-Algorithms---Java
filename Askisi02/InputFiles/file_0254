 destruction and trouble are in their ways
 and of the way of peace they have no knowledge
 there is no fear of god before their eyes
 now we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and all men may be judged by god
 because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
 but now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of god to which witness is given by the law and the prophets
 that is the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ to all those who have faith and one man is not different from another
 for all have done wrong and are far from the glory of god
 and they may have righteousness put to their credit freely by his grace through the salvation which is in christ jesus
 whom god has put forward as the sign of his mercy through faith by his blood to make clear his righteousness when in his pity god let the sins of earlier times go without punishment
 and to make clear his righteousness now so that he might himself be upright and give righteousness to him who has faith in jesus
 what reason then is there for pride it is shut out by what sort of law of works no but by a law of faith
 for this reason then a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law
 or is god the god of jews only is he not in the same way the god of gentiles yes of gentiles
 if god is one and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision and through faith to those who have not circumcision
 do we then through faith make the law of no effect in no way but we make it clear that the law is important
 what then may we say that abraham our father after the flesh has got
 for if abraham got righteousness by works he has reason for pride but not before god
 but what does it say in the holy writings and abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness
 now the reward is credited to him who does works not as of grace but as a debt
 but to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil doer his faith is put to his account as righteousness
 as david says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account god puts righteousness without works saying
 happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing and whose sins are covered
 happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the lord
 is this blessing then for the circumcision only or in the same way for those who have not circumcision for we say that the faith of abraham was put to his account as righteousness
 how then was it judged when he had circumcision or when he had it not not when he had it but when he did not have it
 and he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision so that he might be the father of all those who have faith though they have not circumcision and so that righteousness might be put to their account
 and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision but who keep to the way of that faith which our father abraham had before he underwent circumcision
 for gods word that the earth would be his heritage was given to abraham not through the law but through the righteousness of faith
 for if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage then faith is made of no use and the word of god has no power
