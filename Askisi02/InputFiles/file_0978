 do not take me away with the sinners and the workers of evil who say words of peace to their neighbours but evil is in their hearts
 give them the right reward of their acts and of their evil doings give them punishment for the works of their hands let them have their full reward
 because they have no respect for the works of the lord or for the things which his hands have made they will be broken down and not lifted up by him
 may the lord be praised because he has given ear to the voice of my prayer
 the lord is my strength and my breastplate my heart had faith in him and i am helped for this cause my heart is full of rapture and i will give him praise in my song
 the lord is their strength and a strong place of salvation for his king
 be a saviour to your people and send a blessing on your heritage be their guide and let them be lifted up for ever
 &lta psalm of david&gt give to the lord you sons of the gods give to the lord glory and strength
 give to the lord the full glory of his name give him worship in holy robes
 the voice of the lord is on the waters the god of glory is thundering the lord is on the great waters
 the voice of the lord is full of power the voice of the lord has a noble sound
 by the voice of the lord are the cedar trees broken even the cedars of lebanon are broken by the lord
 he makes them go jumping about like a young ox lebanon and sirion like a young mountain ox
 at the voice of the lord flames of fire are seen
 at the voice of the lord there is a shaking in the waste land even a shaking in the waste land of kadesh
 at the voice of the lord the roes give birth the leaves are taken from the trees in his temple everything says glory
 the lord had his seat as king when the waters came on the earth the lord is seated as king for ever
 the lord will give strength to his people the lord will give his people the blessing of peace
 &lta psalm of david when he went in flight from absalom his son&gt lord how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me  in great numbers they come against me
 unnumbered are those who say of my soul there is no help for him in god  selah 
 but your strength o lord is round me you are my glory and the lifter up of my head
 i send up a cry to the lord with my voice and he gives me an answer from his holy hill  selah 
 i took my rest in sleep and then again i was awake for the lord was my support
 i will have no fear though ten thousand have come round me putting themselves against me
 come to me lord keep me safe o my god for you have given all my haters blows on their face bones the teeth of the evil doers have been broken by you
 salvation comes from the lord your blessing is on your people  selah 
 &lta psalm a song at the blessing of the house of david&gt i will give you praise and honour o lord because through you i have been lifted up you have not given my haters cause to be glad over me
 o lord my god i sent up my cry to you and you have made me well
 o lord you have made my soul come again from the underworld you have given me life and kept me from going down among the dead
 make songs to the lord o you saints of his and give praise to his holy name
