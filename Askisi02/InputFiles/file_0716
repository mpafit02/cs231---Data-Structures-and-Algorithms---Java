 of moab the lord of armies the god of israel has said sorrow on nebo for it has been made waste kiriathaim has been put to shame and is taken the strong place is put to shame and broken down
 the praise of moab has come to an end as for heshbon evil has been designed against her come let us put an end to her as a nation but your mouth will be shut o madmen the sword will go after you
 there is the sound of crying from horonaim wasting and great destruction
 moab is broken her cry has gone out to zoar
 for by the slope of luhith they will go up weeping all the way for on the way down to horonaim the cry of destruction has come to their ears
 go in flight get away with your lives and let your faces be turned to aroer in the arabah
 for because you have put your faith in your strong places you even you will be taken and chemosh will go out as a prisoner his priests and his rulers together
 and the attacker will come against every town not one will be safe and the valley will be made waste and destruction will come to the lowland as the lord has said
 put up a pillar for moab for she will come to a complete end and her towns will become a waste without anyone living in them
 let him be cursed who does the lords work half heartedly let him be cursed who keeps back his sword from blood
 from his earliest days moab has been living in comfort like wine long stored he has not been drained from vessel to vessel he has never gone away as a prisoner so his taste is still in him his smell is unchanged
 so truly the days are coming says the lord when i will send to him men who will have him turned over till there is no more wine in his vessels and his wine skins will be completely broken
 and moab will be shamed on account of chemosh as the children of israel were shamed on account of beth el their hope
 how say you we are men of war and strong fighters
 he who makes moab waste has gone up against her and the best of her young men have gone down to their death says the king whose name is the lord of armies
 the fate of moab is near and trouble is coming on him very quickly
 all you who are round about him give signs of grief for him and all you who have knowledge of his name say how is the strong rod broken even the beautiful branch 
 come down from your glory o people of dibon and take your seat in the place of the waste for the attacker of moab has gone up against you sending destruction on your strong places
 o daughter of aroer take your station by the way on the watch questioning him who is in flight and her who has got away safe say what has been done
 moab has been put to shame she is broken make loud sounds of grief crying out for help give the news in arnon that moab has been made waste
 and punishment has come on the lowlands on holon and jahzah and on mephaath
 and on dibon and on nebo and on beth diblathaim
 and on kiriathaim and on beth gamul and on beth meon
 and on kerioth and on bozrah and on all the towns of the land of moab far and near
 the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken says the lord
 make him full of wine for his heart has been lifted up against the lord and moab will be rolling in the food he was not able to keep down and everyone will be making sport of him
 for did you not make sport of israel was he taken among thieves for whenever you were talking about him you were shaking your head over him
 o people of moab go away from the towns and take cover in the rock be like the dove of the arabah which makes her living place in holes
 we have had word of the pride of moab how great it is how he is lifted up in pride and his great opinion of himself and that his heart is lifted up
 i have knowledge of his wrath says the lord that it is nothing his high sounding words have done nothing
