 where then is that happy condition of yours because i give you witness that if possible you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me
 so then am i no longer your friend because i give you true words
 their interest in you is not good but their desire is that you may be shut out so that you may go after them
 but it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times and not only when i am present with you
 my children of whom i am again in birth pains till christ is formed in you
 truly my desire is to be present with you now using a changed voice for i am troubled about you
 say you whose desire it is to be under the law do you not give ear to the law
 because it is in the writings that abraham had two sons one by the servant woman and one by the free woman
 now the son by the servant woman has his birth after the flesh but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of god
 which things have a secret sense because these women are the two agreements one from the mountain of sinai giving birth to servants which is hagar
 now this hagar is the mountain sinai in arabia and is the image of the jerusalem which now is which is a servant with her children
 but the jerusalem on high is free which is our mother
 for it is in the writings you who have never given birth be glad give cries of joy you who have had no birth pains for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband
 now we brothers as isaac was are the children of the undertaking of god
 but as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the spirit even so it is now
 what then do the writings say send away the servant woman and her son for the son of the servant woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman
 so brothers we are not children of the servant woman but of the free woman
 christ has truly made us free then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again
 see i paul say to you that if you undergo circumcision christ will be of no use to you
 yes i give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision that he will have to keep all the law
 you are cut off from christ you who would have righteousness by the law you are turned away from grace
 for we through the spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness
 because in christ jesus having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit but only faith working through love
 you were going on well who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true
 this ready belief did not come from him who had made you his
 a little leaven makes a change in all the mass
 i am certain about you in the lord that you will be of no other mind but he who is troubling you will have his punishment whoever he is
 but i brothers if i am still preaching circumcision why am i still attacked then has the shame of the cross been taken away
 my desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves
 because you brothers were marked out to be free only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance but through love be servants one to another
