 i have put off my coat how may i put it on my feet are washed how may i make them unclean
 my loved one put his hand on the door and my heart was moved for him
 i got up to let my loved one in and my hands were dropping with myrrh and my fingers with liquid myrrh on the lock of the door
 i made the door open to my loved one but my loved one had taken himself away and was gone my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me i went after him but i did not come near him i said his name but he gave me no answer
 the keepers who go about the town overtook me they gave me blows and wounds the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem if you see my loved one what will you say to him that i am overcome with love
 what is your loved one more than another o fairest among women what is your loved one more than another that you say this to us
 my loved one is white and red the chief among ten thousand
 his head is as the most delicate gold his hair is thick and black as a raven
 his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams washed with milk and rightly placed
 his face is as beds of spices giving out perfumes of every sort his lips like lilies dropping liquid myrrh
 his hands are as rings of gold ornamented with beryl stones his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires
 his legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold his looks are as lebanon beautiful as the cedar tree
 his mouth is most sweet yes he is all beautiful this is my loved one and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
 where is your loved one gone o most fair among women where is your loved one turned away that we may go looking for him with you
 my loved one is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to take food in the gardens and to get lilies
 i am for my loved one and my loved one is for me he takes food among the lilies
 you are beautiful o my love as tirzah as fair as jerusalem you are to be feared like an army with flags
 let your eyes be turned away from me see they have overcome me your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of gilead
 your teeth are like a flock of sheep which come up from the washing every one has two lambs and there is not one without young
 like pomegranate fruit are the sides of your head under your veil
 there are sixty queens and eighty servant wives and young girls without number
 my dove my very beautiful one is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the dearest one of her who gave her birth the daughters saw her and gave her a blessing yes the queens and the servant wives and they gave her praises
 who is she looking down as the morning light fair as the moon clear as the sun who is to be feared like an army with flags
 i went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley and to see if the vine was in bud and the pomegranate trees were in flower
 before i was conscious of it 
 come back come back o shulammite come back come back so that our eyes may see you what will you see in the shulammite a sword dance
 how beautiful are your feet in their shoes o kings daughter  the curves of your legs are like jewels the work of the hands of a good workman
 your stomach is a store of grain with lilies round it and in the middle a round cup full of wine
 your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth
