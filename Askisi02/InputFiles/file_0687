 and the lord said to me make no prayer for this people for their good
 when they go without food i will not give ear to their cry when they give burned offerings and meal offerings i will not take pleasure in them but i will put an end to them by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 then i said ah lord god  see the prophets say to them you will not see the sword or be short of food but i will give you certain peace in this place
 then the lord said to me the prophets say false words in my name and i gave them no orders and i said nothing to them what they say to you is a false vision and wonder working words without substance the deceit of their hearts
 so this is what the lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name though i sent them not and say the sword and need of food will not be in this land the sword and need of food will put an end to those prophets
 and the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of jerusalem because there is no food and because of the sword and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth them or their wives or their sons or their daughters for i will let loose their evil doing on them
 and you are to say this word to them let my eyes be streaming with water night and day and let it not be stopped for the virgin daughter of my people is wounded with a great wound with a very bitter blow
 if i go out into the open country there are those put to death by the sword  and if i go into the town there are those who are diseased from need of food  for the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge
 have you completely given up judah is your soul turned in disgust from zion why have you given us blows from which there is no one to make us well we were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of well being but there was only a great fear
 we are conscious o lord of our sin and of the wrongdoing of our fathers we have done evil against you
 do not be turned from us in disgust because of your name do not put shame on the seat of your glory keep us in mind let not your agreement with us be broken
 are any of the false gods of the nations able to make rain come are the heavens able to give showers are you not he o lord our god so we will go on waiting for you for you have done all these things
 then the lord said to me even if moses and samuel came before me i would have no desire for this people send them away from before me and let them go
 and it will be when they say to you where are we to go then you are to say to them the lord has said such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are to be in need of food to need of food and such as are to be taken away prisoners to be taken away
 and i will put over them four divisions says the lord the sword causing death dogs pulling the dead bodies about and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to take their bodies for food and put an end to them
 and i will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah and what he did in jerusalem
 for who will have pity on you o jerusalem and who will have sorrow for you or who will go out of his way to see how you are
 you have given me up says the lord you have gone back so my hand is stretched out against you for your destruction i am tired of changing my purpose
 and i have sent a cleaning wind on them in the public places of the land i have taken their children from them i have given my people to destruction they have not been turned from their ways
 i have let their widows be increased in number more than the sand of the seas i have sent against them against the mother and the young men one who makes waste in the heat of the day causing pain and fears to come on her suddenly
 the mother of seven is without strength her spirit is gone from her her sun has gone down while it is still day she has been shamed and overcome and the rest of them i will give up to the sword before their haters says the lord
 sorrow is mine my mother because you have given birth to me a cause of fighting and argument in all the earth  i have not made men my creditors and i am not in debt to any but every one of them is cursing me
 
 is it possible for iron to be broken even iron from the north and brass
 i will give your wealth and your stores to your attackers without a price because of all your sins even in every part of your land
 they will go away with your haters into a land which is strange to you for my wrath is on fire with a flame which will be burning on you
 o lord you have knowledge keep me in mind and come to my help and give their right reward to those who are attacking me take me not away for you are slow to be angry see how i have undergone shame because of you from all those who make little of your word
 but to me your word is a joy making my heart glad for i am named by your name o lord god of armies
 i did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad and i had no joy i kept by myself because of your hand for you have made me full of wrath
 why is my pain unending and my wound without hope of being made well sorrow is mine for you are to me as a stream offering false hope and as waters which are not certain
