 and god fearing men put stephens body in its last resting place making great weeping over him
 but saul was burning with hate against the church going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison
 but those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word
 and philip went down to samaria and was teaching them about christ
 and all the people gave attention to the words which philip said when they saw the signs which he did
 for unclean spirits came out from those who had them crying with a loud voice and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well
 and there was much joy in that town
 but there was a certain man named simon who in the past had been a wonder worker and a cause of surprise to the people of samaria saying that he himself was a great man
 to whom they all gave attention from the smallest to the greatest saying this man is that power of god which is named great
 and they gave attention to him because for a long time his wonder working powers had kept them under his control
 but when they had faith in the good news given by philip about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ a number of men and women had baptism
 and simon himself had faith and having had baptism he went with philip and seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did he was full of surprise
 now when the apostles at jerusalem had news that the people of samaria had taken the word of god into their hearts they sent to them peter and john
 who when they came there made prayer for them that the holy spirit might be given to them
 for up to that time he had not come on any of them only baptism had been given to them in the name of the lord jesus
 then they put their hands on them and the holy spirit came on them
 now when simon saw that the holy spirit was given through the touch of the apostles hands he made them an offering of money saying
 give me this power so that when i put my hands on anyone he may get the holy spirit
 but peter said may your money come to destruction with you because you had the idea that what is freely given by god may be got for a price
 you have no part in this business because your heart is not right before god
 let your heart be changed and make prayer to god that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts
 for i see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin
 and simon answering said make prayer for me to the lord so that these things which you have said may not come on me
 so they having given their witness and made clear the word of the lord went back to jerusalem giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of samaria
 but an angel of the lord said to philip get up and go to the south to the road which goes from jerusalem to gaza through the waste land
 and he went and there was a man of ethiopia a servant of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians and controller of all her property who had come up to jerusalem for worship
 he was going back seated in his carriage and was reading the book of the prophet isaiah
 and the spirit said to philip go near and get on his carriage
 and philip running up to him saw that he was reading isaiah the prophet and said to him is the sense of what you are reading clear to you
 and he said how is that possible when i have no guide and he made philip get up by his side
