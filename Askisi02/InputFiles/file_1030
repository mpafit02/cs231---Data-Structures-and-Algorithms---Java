 and if anyone goes on acting as a prophet then his father and his mother who gave him life will say to him you may not go on living for you are saying what is false in the name of the lord and his father and his mother will put a sword through him when he does so
 and it will come about in that day that the prophets will be shamed every man on account of his vision when he is talking as a prophet and they will not put on a robe of hair for purposes of deceit
 but he will say i am no prophet but a worker on the land for i have been an owner of land from the time when i was young
 and if anyone says to him what are these wounds between your hands then he will say those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends
 awake  o sword against the keeper of my flock and against him who is with me says the lord of armies put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep will go in flight and my hand will be turned against the little ones
 and it will come about that in all the land says the lord two parts of it will be cut off and come to an end but the third will be still living there
 and i will make the third part go through the fire cleaning them as silver is made clean and testing them as gold is tested and they will make their prayer to me and i will give them an answer i will say it is my people and they will say the lord is my god
 see a day of the lord is coming when they will make division of your goods taken by force before your eyes
 for i will get all the nations together to make war against jerusalem and the town will be overcome and the goods taken from the houses and the women taken by force and half the town will go away as prisoners and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the town
 then the lord will go out and make war against those nations as he did in the day of the fight
 and in that day his feet will be on the mount of olives which is opposite jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives will be parted in the middle to the east and to the west forming a very great valley and half the mountain will be moved to the north and half of it to the south
 and the valley will be stopped  and you will go in flight as you went in flight from the earth shock in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god will come and all his holy ones with him
 and in that day there will be no heat or cold or ice
 and it will be unbroken day such as the lord has knowledge of without change of day and night and even at nightfall it will be light
 and on that day living waters will go out from jerusalem half of them flowing to the sea on the east and half to the sea on the west in summer and in winter it will be so
 and the lord will be king over all the earth in that day there will be one lord and his name one
 and all the land will become like the arabah from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and she will be lifted up and be living in her place from the doorway of benjamin to the place of the first doorway to the doorway of the angle and from the tower of hananel to the kings wine crushing places men will be living in her
 and there will be no more curse but jerusalem will be living without fear of danger
 and this will be the disease which the lord will send on all the peoples which have been warring against jerusalem their flesh will be wasted away while they are on their feet their eyes will be wasted in their heads and their tongues in their mouths
 and it will be on that day that a great fear will be sent among them from the lord and everyone will take his neighbours hand and every mans hand will be lifted against his neighbours
 and even judah will be fighting against jerusalem and the wealth of all the nations round about will be massed together a great store of gold and silver and clothing
 and the horses and the transport beasts the camels and the asses and all the beasts in those tents will be attacked by the same disease
 and it will come about that everyone who is still living of all those nations who came against jerusalem will go up from year to year to give worship to the king the lord of armies and to keep the feast of tents
 and it will be that if any one of all the families of the earth does not go up to jerusalem to give worship to the king the lord of armies on them there will be no rain
 and if the family of egypt does not go up or come there they will be attacked by the disease which the lord will send on the nations
 this will be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to keep the feast of tents
 on that day all the bells of the horses will be holy to the lord and the pots in the lords house will be like the basins before the altar
 and every pot in jerusalem and in judah will be holy to the lord of armies and all those who make offerings will come and take them for boiling their offerings in that day there will be no more traders in the house of the lord of armies
 and lifting up my eyes i saw a man with a measuring line in his hand
 and i said to him where are you going and he said to me to take the measure of jerusalem to see how wide and how long it is
