 then they gave the men soup from the pot and while they were drinking the soup they gave a cry and said o man of god there is death in the pot and they were not able to take any more food
 but he said get some meal and he put it into the pot and said now give it to the people so that they may have food and there was nothing bad in the pot
 now a man came from baal shalishah with an offering of first fruits for the man of god twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag and he said give these to the people for food
 but his servant said how am i to put this before a hundred men but he said give it to the people for food for the lord says there will be food for them and some over
 so he put it before them and they had a meal and there was more than enough as the lord had said
 now naaman chief of the army of the king of aram was a man of high position with his master and greatly respected because by him the lord had given salvation to aram but he was a leper
 now the aramaeans had gone out in bands and taken prisoner from israel a little girl who became servant to naamans wife
 and she said to her masters wife if only my lord would go to the prophet in samaria he would make him well
 and someone went and said to his lord this is what the girl from the land of israel says
 so the king of aram said go then and i will send a letter to the king of israel and he went taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothing
 and he took the letter to the king of israel in which the king of aram had said see i have sent my servant naaman to you to be made well for he is a leper
 but the king of israel after reading the letter was greatly troubled and said am i god to give death and life why does this man send a leper to me to be made well is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war
 now elisha the man of god hearing that the king of israel had done this sent to the king saying why are you troubled send the man to me so that he may see that there is a prophet in israel
 so naaman with all his horses and his carriages came to the door of elishas house
 and elisha sent a servant to him saying go to jordan and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean
 but naaman was angry and went away and said i had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as i am and make prayer to the lord his god and with a wave of his hand over the place make the leper well
 are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not be washed in them and become clean so turning he went away in wrath
 then his servants came to him and said if the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing would you not have done it how much more then when he says to you be washed and become clean
 then he went down seven times into the waters of jordan as the man of god had said and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again and he was clean
 then he went back to the man of god with all his train and taking his place before him said now i am certain that there is no god in all the earth but only in israel now then take an offering from me
 but he said by the life of the lord whose servant i am i will take nothing from you and he did his best to make him take it but he would not
 then naaman said if you will not then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs because from now on your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods but only to the lord
 but may your servant have the lords forgiveness for this one thing when my master goes into the house of rimmon for worship there supported on my arm and my head is bent in the house of rimmon when his head is bent in the house of rimmon may your servant have the lords forgiveness for this thing
 and he said to him go in peace and he went from him some distance
 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said now my master has taken nothing from naaman this aramaean of what he would have given him by the living lord i will go after him and get something from him
 so gehazi went after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said is all well
 and he said all is well but my master has sent me saying even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of ephraim will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them
 and naaman said be good enough to take two talents and forcing him to take them he put two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and gave them to his two servants to take before him
 when he came to the hill he took them from their hands and put them away in the house and he sent the men away and they went
 then he came in and took his place before his master and elisha said to him where have you come from gehazi and he said your servant went nowhere
