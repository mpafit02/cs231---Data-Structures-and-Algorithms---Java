 why because they were not searching for it by faith but by works they came up against the stone which was in the way
 as it is said see i am putting in zion a stone causing a fall and a rock in the way but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame
 paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ in agreement with the faith of the saints of god and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion
 in the hope of eternal life which was made certain before eternal time by the word of god who is ever true
 who in his time made clear his word in the good news of which by the order of god our saviour i became a preacher
 to titus my true child in our common faith grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our saviour
 i did not take you with me when i went away from crete so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there placing men in authority over the churches in every town as i said to you
 men having a good record husbands of one wife whose children are of the faith children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled
 for it is necessary for a bishop to be a man of virtue as gods servant not pushing himself forward not quickly moved to wrath or blows not desiring profit for himself
 but opening his house freely to guests a lover of what is good serious minded upright holy self controlled
 keeping to the true word of the teaching so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters
 for there are men who are not ruled by law foolish talkers false teachers specially those of the circumcision
 by whom some families have been completely overturned who take money for teaching things which are not right these will have to be stopped
 one of their prophets has said the men of crete are ever false evil beasts lovers of food hating work
 this witness is true so say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith
 giving no attention to the fictions of the jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge
 to the clean in heart all things are clean but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean they become unclean in mind and in thought
 they say that they have knowledge of god while by their acts they are turning their backs on him they are hated by all hard hearted and judged to be without value for any good work
 but let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching
 that old men are to be simple in their tastes serious wise true in faith in love and of a quiet mind
 that old women are to be self respecting in behaviour not saying evil of others not given to taking much wine teachers of that which is good
 training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children
 to be wise in mind clean in heart kind working in their houses living under the authority of their husbands so that no evil may be said of the word of god
 to the young men give orders to be wise and serious minded
 in all things see that you are an example of good works holy in your teaching serious in behaviour
 saying true and right words against which no protest may be made so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame unable to say any evil of us
 servants are to be under the authority of their masters pleasing them in all things without argument
 not taking what is not theirs but giving clear signs of their good faith in all things doing credit to the teaching of god our saviour
 for the grace of god has come giving salvation to all men
 training us so that turning away from evil and the desires of this world we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of god in this present life
