 and israel said why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother
 and they said the man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family saying is your father still living have you another brother and we had to give him answers how were we to have any idea that he would say come back with your brother
 then judah said to israel his father send the boy with me and let us be up and going so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction
 put him into my care and make me responsible for him if i do not give him safely back to you let mine be the sin for ever
 truly if we had not let the time go by we might have come back again by now
 then their father israel said to them if it has to be so then do this take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man perfumes and honey and spices and nuts
 and take twice as much money with you that is to say take back the money which was put in your bags for it may have been an error
 and take your brother and go back to the man
 and may god the ruler of all give you mercy before the man so that he may give you back your other brother and benjamin if my children are to be taken from me there is no help for it
 so they took what their father said for the man and twice as much money in their hands and benjamin and went on their journey to egypt and came before joseph
 and when joseph saw benjamin he said to his chief servant take these men into my house and make ready a meal for they will take food with me in the middle of the day
 and the servant did as joseph said and took the men into josephs house
 now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into josephs house and they said it is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time he is looking for something against us so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use
 so they went up to josephs chief servant at the door of the house
 and said o my lord we only came down the first time to get food
 and when we came to our nights resting place on opening our bags we saw that every mans money was in the mouth of his bag all our money in full weight and we have it with us to give it back
 as well as more money with which to get food we have no idea who put our money in our bags
 then the servant said peace be with you have no fear your god even the god of your father has put wealth in your bags for you i had your money then he let simeon come out to them
 and the servant took them into josephs house and gave them water for washing their feet and he gave their asses food
 and they got ready the things for joseph before he came in the middle of the day for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there
 and when joseph came in they gave him the things which they had for him and went down to the earth before him
 and he said how are you is your father well the old man of whom you were talking to me is he still living
 and they said your servant our father is well he is still living and they went down on their faces before him
 then lifting up his eyes he saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and he said is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word and he said god be good to you my son
 then josephs heart went out to his brother and he went quickly into his room for he was overcome with weeping
 then after washing his face he came out and controlling his feelings said put food before us
 and they put a meal ready for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians who were with him by themselves because the egyptians may not take food with the hebrews for that would make them unclean
 and they were all given their seats before him in order of birth from the oldest to the youngest so that they were looking at one another in wonder
 and joseph sent food to them from his table but he sent five times as much to benjamin as to any of the others and they took wine freely with him
 then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house saying put as much food into the mens bags as will go into them and put every mans money in the mouth of his bag
