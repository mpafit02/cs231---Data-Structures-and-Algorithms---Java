 the kings came on to the fight the kings of canaan were warring in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no profit in money
 the stars from heaven were fighting from their highways they were fighting against sisera
 the river kishon took them violently away stopping their flight the river kishon give praise o my soul to the strength of the lord 
 then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping the stamping of their war horses
 a curse a curse on meroz  said the angel of the lord a bitter curse on her townspeople  because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord among the strong ones
 blessings be on jael more than on all women  blessings greater than on any in the tents 
 his request was for water she gave him milk she put butter before him on a fair plate
 she put out her hand to the tent pin and her right hand to the workmans hammer and she gave sisera a blow crushing his head wounding and driving through his brow
 bent at her feet he went down he was stretched out bent at her feet he went down where he was bent down there he went down in death
 looking out from the window she gave a cry the mother of sisera was crying out through the window why is his carriage so long in coming when will the noise of his wheels be sounding
 her wise women gave answer to her yes she made answer again to herself
 are they not getting are they not parting the goods among them a young girl or two to every man and to sisera robes of coloured needlework worked in fair colours on this side and on that for the neck of the queen
 so may destruction come on all your haters o lord but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength and for forty years the land had peace
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord gave them up into the hand of midian for seven years
 and midian was stronger than israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made holes for themselves in the mountains and hollows in the rocks and strong places
 and whenever israels grain was planted the midianites and the amalekites and the people of the east came up against them
 and put their army in position against them and they took all the produce of the earth as far as gaza till there was no food in israel or any sheep or oxen or asses
 for they came up regularly with their oxen and their tents they came like the locusts in number they and their camels were without number and they came into the land for its destruction
 and israel was in great need because of midian and the cry of the children of israel went up to the lord
 and when the cry of the children of israel because of midian came before the lord
 the lord sent a prophet to the children of israel who said to them the lord the god of israel has said i took you up from egypt out of the prison house
 and i took you out of the hands of the egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you and i sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land
 and i said to you i am the lord your god you are not to give worship to the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but you did not give ear to my voice
 now the angel of the lord came and took his seat under the oak tree in ophrah in the field of joash the abiezrite and his son gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed so that the midianites might not see it
 and the angel of the lord came before his eyes and said to him the lord is with you o man of war
 then gideon said to him o my lord if the lord is with us why has all this come on us and where are all his works of power of which our fathers have given us word saying did not the lord take us out of egypt but now he has given us up handing us over to the power of midian
 and the lord turning to him said go in the strength you have and be israels saviour from midian have i not sent you
 and he said to him o lord how may i be the saviour of israel see my family is the poorest in manasseh and i am the least in my fathers house
 then the lord said to him truly i will be with you and you will overcome the midianites as if they were one man
 so he said to him if now i have grace in your eyes then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me
