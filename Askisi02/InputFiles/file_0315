 and the king went to gibeon to make an offering there because that was the chief high place it was solomons way to make a thousand burned offerings on that altar
 in gibeon solomon had a vision of the lord in a dream by night and god said to him say what i am to give you
 and solomon said great was your mercy to david my father as his life before you was true and upright and his heart was true to you and you have kept for him this greatest mercy a son to take his place this day
 and now o lord my god you have made your servant king in the place of david my father and i am only a young boy with no knowledge of how to go out or come in
 and your servant has round him the people of your selection a people so great that they may not be numbered and no account of them may be given
 give your servant then a wise heart for judging your people able to see what is good and what evil for who is able to be the judge of this great people
 now these words and solomons request were pleasing to the lord
 and god said to him because your request is for this thing and not for long life for yourself or for wealth or for the destruction of your haters but for wisdom to be a judge of causes
 i have done as you said i have given you a wise and far seeing heart so that there has never been your equal in the past and never will there be any like you in the future
 and with this i have given you what you made no request for wealth and honour so that no king was ever your equal
 and if you go on in my ways keeping my laws and my orders as your father david did i will give you a long life
 and solomon awakening saw that it was a dream then he came to jerusalem where he went before the ark of the agreement of the lord offering burned offerings and peace offerings and he made a feast for all his servants
 then two loose women of the town came and took their places before the king
 and one of them said o my lord i and this woman are living in the same house and i gave birth to a child by her side in the house
 and three days after the birth of my child this woman had a child we were together no other person was with us in the house but we two only
 in the night this woman sleeping on her child was the cause of its death
 and she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was sleeping and she took it in her arms and put her dead child in my arms
 and when i got up to give my child the breast i saw that it was dead but in the morning looking at it with care i saw that it was not my son
 and the other woman said no but the living child is my son and the dead one yours but the first said no the dead child is your son and the living one mine so they kept on talking before the king
 then the king said one says the living child is my son and yours is the dead and the other says not so but your son is the dead one and mine is the living
 then he said get me a sword so they went and put a sword before the king
 and the king said let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other
 then the mother of the living child came forward for her heart went out to her son and she said o my lord give her the child do not on any account put it to death but the other woman said it will not be mine or yours let it be cut in two
 then the king made answer and said give her the child and do not put it to death she is the mother of it
 and news of this decision which the king had made went through all israel and they had fear of the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to give decisions
