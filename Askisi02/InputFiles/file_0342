 now saul had given his daughter michal davids wife to palti the son of laish of gallim
 and the ziphites came to saul at gibeah and said is not david waiting secretly near us in the hill of hachilah before the waste land
 then saul went down to the waste land of ziph taking with him three thousand of the best men of israel to make search for david in the waste land of ziph
 and saul put up his tents on the hill of hachilah which is in front of the waste land on the road but david was in the waste land and he saw that saul was coming after him
 and so david sent out watchers and got word from them that saul was certainly coming
 and david got up and came to the place where sauls tents were and david had a view of the place where saul was sleeping with abner the son of ner the captain of his army and saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts and the tents of the people were all round him
 then david said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother of joab who will go down with me to the tents of saul and abishai said i will go down with you
 so david and abishai came down to the army by night and saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head and abner and the people were sleeping round him
 then abishai said to david god has given up your hater into your hands today now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear and there will be no need to give him a second
 and david said to abishai do not put him to death for who without sin may put out his hand against the man on whom the lord has put the holy oil
 and david said by the living lord the lord will send destruction on him the natural day of his death will come or he will go into the fight and come to his end
 never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water and let us go
 so david took the spear and the vessel of water from sauls head and they got away without any man seeing them or being conscious of their coming or awaking for they were all sleeping because a deep sleep from the lord had come on them
 then david went over to the other side and took his place on the top of a mountain some distance away with a great space between them
 and crying out to the people and to abner the son of ner david said have you no answer to give abner then abner said who is that crying out to the king
 and david said to abner are you not a man of war is there any other like you in israel why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king for one of the people came in to put the king your lord to death
 what you have done is not good by the living lord death is the right fate for you because you have not kept watch over your lord the man on whom the lord has put the holy oil now see where is the kings spear and the vessel of water which was by his head
 and saul conscious that the voice was davids said is that your voice david my son and david said it is my voice o my lord king
 and he said why does my lord go armed against his servant what have i done or what evil is there in me
 let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant if it is the lord who is moving you against me let him take an offering but if it is the children of men may they be cursed before the lord for driving me out today and keeping me from my place in the heritage of the lord saying go be the servant of other gods
 then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the lord for the king of israel has come out to take my life like one going after birds in the mountains
 then saul said i have done wrong come back to me david my son i will do you no more wrong because my life was dear to you today truly i have been foolish and my error is very great
 then david said here is the kings spear  let one of the young men come over and get it
 and the lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith because the lord gave you into my hands today and i would not put out my hand against the man who has been marked with the holy oil
 and so as your life was dear to me today may my life be dear to the lord and may he make me free from all my troubles
 then saul said to david may a blessing be on you david my son you will do great things and without doubt you will overcome then david went on his way and saul went back to his place
 and david said to himself some day death will come to me by the hand of saul the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the philistines then saul will give up hope of taking me in any part of the land of israel and so i may be able to get away from him
 so david and the six hundred men who were with him went over to achish the son of maoch king of gath
 and david and his men were living with achish at gath every man had his family with him and david had his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail of carmel who had been the wife of nabal
 and saul hearing that david had gone to gath went after him no longer
