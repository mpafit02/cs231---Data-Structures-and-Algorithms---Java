 and when his words came to their ears they went out one by one starting with the oldest even to the last because they were conscious of what was in their hearts and jesus was there by himself with the woman before him
 then jesus got up and seeing nobody but the woman he said to her where are the men who said things against you did no one give a decision against you
 and she said no man lord and jesus said and i do not give a decision against you go and never do wrong again 
 then again jesus said to them i am the light of the world he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life
 so the pharisees said to him the witness you give is about yourself your witness is not true
 jesus said in answer even if i give witness about myself my witness is true because i have knowledge of where i came from and where i am going but you have no knowledge of where i come from or of where i am going
 you are judging from what you see i am judging no man
 even if i am judging my decision is right because i am not by myself  with me is the father who sent me
 even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true
 i give witness about myself and the father who sent me gives witness about me
 then they said to him where is your father jesus said in answer you have no knowledge of me or of my father if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my father
 jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored while he was teaching in the temple but no man took him because his time was still to come
 then he said to them again i am going away and you will be looking for me but death will overtake you in your sins it is not possible for you to come where i am going
 so the jews said will he take his life is that why he says where i go it is not possible for you to come
 and he said to them you are of the earth i am from heaven you are of this world i am not of this world
 for this reason i said to you that death will overtake you in your sins for if you have not faith that i am he death will come to you while you are in your sins
 then they said to him who are you jesus said what i said to you from the first
 i have much to say about you and against you but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me i say to the world
 they did not see that his words were about the father
 so jesus said when the son of man has been lifted up by you then it will be clear to you who i am and that i do nothing of myself but say as the father gave me teaching
 he who sent me is with me he has not gone from me because at all times i do the things which are pleasing to him
 when he said this a number came to have faith in him
 then jesus said to the jews who had faith in him if you keep my word then you are truly my disciples
 and you will have knowledge of what is true and that will make you free
 they said to him in answer we are abrahams seed and have never been any mans servant why do you say you will become free
 and this was the answer jesus gave them truly i say to you everyone who does evil is the servant of sin
 now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever but the son does
 if then the son makes you free you will be truly free
 i am conscious that you are abrahams seed but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you
 i say the things which i have seen in my fathers house and you do the things which come to you from your fathers house
